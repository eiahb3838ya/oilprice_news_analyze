update 6-u.s. toughens stance on iran, lists sweeping demands
reuters the united states on monday demanded iran make sweeping changes from dropping its nuclear programme to pulling out of the syrian civil war or face severe economic sanctions as the trump administration hardened its approach to tehran
iran dismissed washington s ultimatum and one senior iranian official said it showed the united states is seeking regime change in iran
weeks after president donald trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with iran his administration threatened to impose the strongest sanctions in history and vowed to crush iranian operatives abroad setting washington and tehran further on a course of confrontation
secretary of state mike pompeo demanded sweeping changes that would force iran effectively to reverse the recent spread of its military and political influence through the middle east to the shores of the mediterranean sea
the speech added to the tension between the two countries which grew notably when trump this month withdrew from the international agreement aimed at preventing tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon
if washington sees tangible shifts in iran s policies it is prepared to lift sanctions pompeo said
the sting of sanctions will only grow more painful if the regime does not change course from the unacceptable and unproductive path it has chosen for itself and the people of iran pompeo said in his first major speech since becoming secretary of state
these will be the strongest sanctions in history by the time we are done he added
the european union largely dismissed pompeo s speech and said it remained committed to the full implementation of the nuclear deal
pompeo took aim at iran s policy of expansion in the middle east through support for armed groups in countries such as syria lebanon and yemen
he warned that the united states would crush iranian operatives and proxies abroad and told tehran to pull out forces under its command from the syrian civil war where they have helped president bashar gain the upper hand
iran s president summarily dismissed pompeo s demands
who are you to decide for iran and the world the ilna news agency quoted hassan rouhani as saying
the world today does not accept america to decide for the world as countries are independent that era is over we will continue our path with the support of our a senior iranian official said pompeo s remarks showed that the united states was pushing for regime change a charged phrase often associated with the invasion of iraq in and the overthrow of president saddam hussein
pompeo warned that if iran fully resumed its nuclear programme washington would be ready to respond and said the administration would hold companies doing prohibited business in iran to account
our demands on iran are not unreasonable give up your programme pompeo said should they choose to go back should they begin to enrich we are fully prepared to respond to that as well he said declining to elaborate
pompeo said washington would work with the defense department and allies to counter iran in the cyberspace and maritime areas
the pentagon said it would take all necessary steps to confront iranian behaviour in the region and was assessing whether that could include new actions or doubling down on current ones
pompeo will have an uphill battle convincing european allies to sign on to the administration s plan b on iran after its withdrawal from the nuclear deal formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa
secretary pompeo s speech has not demonstrated how walking away from the jcpoa has made or will make the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation or how it puts us in a better position to influence iran s conduct in areas outside the scope of jcpoa
there is no alternative to the jcpoa the eu said in a statement
pompeo said if iran made major changes the united states was prepared to ease sanctions full diplomatic and commercial relations and support the country s into the international economic system
any new sanctions will raise the cost of trade for iran and are expected to further deter western companies from investing there giving hardliners including the islamic revolutionary guard corps an opportunity to cement their grip on power
iran s ruling elite are mindful of recent protests sparked by economic hardship which is in part their calculation for working with the europeans on ways to salvage the nuclear deal
pompeo s speech did not explicitly call for regime change but he repeatedly urged the iranian people not to put up with their leaders specifically naming rouhani and foreign minister mohammad javad zarif
at the end of the day the iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership pompeo said
suzanne maloney deputy director of the brooking institution think tank s foreign policy programme said pompeo s speech did indeed amount to a strategy of regime change
there is only one way to read it and that is that trump administration has wedded itself to a strategy to iran one that is likely to alienate our allies
one with dubious prospects for success she said
the administration s approach explicitly puts the onus on the iranian people to change their leadership or face cataclysmic financial pressure said maloney who has advised the state department on iran in the bush administration between
lebanese analyst ghaleb kandil who has close ties to the hezbollah group said washington s demands have previously not worked
these are conditions that were tested in previous phases of american pressures before the nuclear deal when iran was in more difficult circumstances than it is in these days and it did not surrender to these conditions or accept them said kandil
pompeo outlined demands for iran including to stop uranium enrichment never to pursue plutonium reprocessing and to close its heavy water reactor
it also had to declare all previous military dimensions of its nuclear programme and to permanently and verifiably abandon such work he said
pompeo s demand that tehran stop uranium enrichment goes even further than the nuclear deal
iran says its nuclear work has medical uses and will produce energy to meet domestic demand and complement its oil reserves
washington s regional allies the gulf arabs and israel who were strong critics of the deal praised the administration s position on monday
european parties to the nuclear deal france britain and germany are working to find a way to keep the nuclear pact in effect after washington s exit
