russia's first sea-borne nuclear power plant arrives in arctic
moscow reuters russia s nuclear power plant arrived in the arctic port of murmansk over the weekend in preparation for its maiden mission providing electricity to an isolated russian town across the bering strait from alaska
the state company behind the plant called the akademik lomonosov says it could pioneer a new power source for remote regions of the planet but green campaigners have expressed concern about the risk of nuclear accidents
greenpeace has called it the nuclear titanic
russian state nuclear company rosatom which developed the floating power plant said that it docked the unit in murmansk on saturday where it was towed from st petersburg the city where it was built
in murmansk it will take on board a supply of nuclear fuel
it will then will be towed to the town of pevek in the far eastern region of chukotka separated from the state of alaska by the miles wide bering strait
it will start operations there next year
the plant will replace a power plant and an ageing nuclear power plant supplying more than people with electricity in chukotka rosatom said
rosatom has long planned to launch the power units which with their mobile small capacity plants are best suited to remote regions
it says they can help the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming
the small plants were designed to make it possible to supply electricity to areas of russia
they can operate without the need for refuelling for years
environmental protection groups including greenpeace have sent a letter to rosatom boss alexei likhachyov demanding strict adherence to safety standards and saying they were watching the floating facility s development with great concern
the letter calls for full and unrestricted regulatory oversight by the russian nuclear regulator and an international study into the environmental impact before the reactors are loaded with fuel and tested
nuclear reactors bobbing around the arctic ocean will pose a shockingly obvious threat to a fragile environment which is already under enormous pressure from climate change jan haverkamp nuclear expert for greenpeace central and eastern europe said in a statement last month
