energy may give further impetus to u.s. small-cap stocks
new york reuters stocks look poised to extend a breakout rally especially if oil prices advance deeper into levels last seen in to drive further gains in the small energy companies that have provided leadership in recent week analysts and investors said
the russell index of small capitalisation stocks closed at a record high for a third day in a row on friday and registered its third week of gains sharply outperforming stocks on wall street with all three major indexes posting losses for the week
the russell is up percent since its low for the year while the s p is up just percent since that date
the s p index is also at a record high
energy shares within the s p have led recent gains thanks to a jump in oil prices which analysts said should boost earnings forecasts for the sector
the outperformance of stocks has been driven partly by the december tax overhaul
the legislation included steep corporate tax cuts that particularly benefited companies which had been paying higher rates than companies overall
recent trade tensions have also lifted shares of small caps whose business is largely domestic along with stronger economic growth
some of those benefits have been reflected in earnings growth which has outpaced growth of larger names
profit growth for russell companies is estimated at percent while earnings for the s p companies increased percent from a year ago according to thomson reuters data
the s p energy index is up percent for the quarter so far the group followed by health care up percent
crude futures edged lower on friday but remained above a barrel and registered a third straight week of gains lifted by falling venezuelan production strong global demand and looming sanctions on iran
even though energy stocks have had a good run estimates will be climbing because analysts are raising their oil forecasts
so even though the stocks go up they can still look cheap because the earnings estimate is going to go up as fast as the stock said steve desanctis equity strategist at jefferies in new york which has been overweight energy since january
bryant evans portfolio manager at cozad asset management in champaign illinois said he has been buying shares of energy service providers
some of the smaller energy service providers got banged up so badly when oil went down he said
but the ones who survived have a real opportunity to grow and take market share now that oil is at a several investors also said they favoured financials within the space particularly regional banks which have risen sharply this year compared with bigger banks
the s p bank index is down percent year to date compared with a percent gain in the kbw regional banking index
the prospect of regulations being reduced further for some smaller banks has been a positive
regulations have been a big headwind in the last couple of years said anthony saglimbene global market strategist at ameriprise financial in troy michigan
easing regulation would benefit the health care group has benefited from merger activity including zoetis inc s announcement this week to buy abaxis inc
health care has been the sector within the s p so far this year up percent
