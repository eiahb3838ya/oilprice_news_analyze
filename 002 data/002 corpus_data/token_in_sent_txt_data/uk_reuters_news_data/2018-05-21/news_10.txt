update 1-energy may give further impetus to u.s. small-cap stocks
new york reuters stocks look poised to extend a breakout move higher especially if oil prices rally further and drive gains in smaller energy companies that have provided leadership in recent weeks analysts and investors said
the russell index of small capitalization stocks was on track for a fourth consecutive record closing high on monday and registered its third week of gains friday sharply outperforming stocks on wall street
all three major indexes posted losses for the week
the russell is up percent since its low for the year while the s p is up just percent since that date
the s p index is also at a record high
energy shares within the s p have led recent gains thanks to a jump in oil prices which analysts said should boost earnings forecasts for the sector
the outperformance of stocks has been driven partly by the december tax overhaul
the legislation included steep corporate tax cuts that particularly benefited companies which had been paying higher rates than companies overall
recent trade tensions have also lifted shares of small caps whose business is largely domestic along with stronger economic growth
some of those benefits have been reflected in earnings growth which has outpaced growth of larger names
profit growth for russell companies is estimated at percent while earnings for the s p companies increased percent from a year ago according to thomson reuters data

bryant evans portfolio manager at cozad asset management in champaign illinois said he has been buying shares of energy service providers
some of the smaller energy service providers got banged up so badly when oil went down he said

the s p bank index is up percent year to date compared with an percent gain in the kbw regional banking index
the prospect of regulations being reduced further for some smaller banks has been a positive
