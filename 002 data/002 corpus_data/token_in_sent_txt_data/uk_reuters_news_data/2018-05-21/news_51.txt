update 2-australia's agl rejects alinta offer for ageing coal-fired plant
agl sticks to plan to shut liddell plant in alinta to look for other cheap power generation government urges agl to commit funds to replace liddell adds comment from government alinta may reuters australia s top power producer agl energy on monday turned down a a million million offer for an ageing energy plant from alinta energy and shunned government pleas to keep the facility open beyond
agl s liddell power plant which supplies percent of the electricity used in australia s most populous state new south wales is seen as crucial for energy security as the grid becomes more reliant on intermittent wind and solar power
a sale to alinta would have kept the plant open for longer and increased competition in the market keeping a lid on soaring electricity prices a hot political potato with state and federal elections looming in the next months
agl s decision is disappointing australian energy minister josh frydenberg said in a statement
he said agl s chief executive had first raised the prospect of selling liddell in a meeting with the prime minister last year although agl has long said it had no plan to sell the plant as it needs the power to meet its customers needs
alinta said it was disappointed with agl s decision but was not going to raise its offer
we will now move on and progress other opporutnities to acquire generation sources in order to provide affordable and reliable energy to our customers an alinta spokesman said
agl paid virtually nothing when it acquired liddell in but has since spent around a million to keep the plant running reliably until when it will be years old
it said the offer from alinta was too low based on the cash it could make running the plant for another four years and then converting the site for a battery installation
agl last year outlined a a billion plan to replace liddell s capacity after including building two new plants upgrading its bayswater plant and building megawatts of wind and solar farms
so far it has only committed funding for a small portion of the total plan
the government calls on agl to financially commit to all other stages of its replacement plan frydenberg said
