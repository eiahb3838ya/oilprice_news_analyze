the local environment has been devastated according to the plaintiffs with marine life killed by water discharges from the plant s cooling system and coal dust contaminating the air
a district court in and the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in ruled that the lawsuit was barred because the ifc is immune from such litigation under the law
