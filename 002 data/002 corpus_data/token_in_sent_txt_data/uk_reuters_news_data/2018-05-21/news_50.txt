exclusive -bp back on its feet but ceo senses no respite
london reuters after the near collapse of his company following the gulf of mexico disaster and a slump in oil prices bp chief executive officer bob dudley is hardly relaxed
it doesn t feel like we are in a serene time for any energy company dudley told reuters in an interview
bp is stronger today than at any other time since the deepwater horizon rig accident
with oil prices at their highest since late and bp shares back to levels not seen in more than years it is once again in a position to contemplate boosting dividends and acquiring dudley said
sitting in his office in bp s central london headquarters in st james square dudley said he intends to carry on leading the company into and navigate it through a phase of expansion and new uncertainty following a tumultuous eight years at the helm
the oil and gas sector is looking to retain its relevance as economies battle climate change by weaning themselves from their dependence on fossil fuels a major source of greenhouse gas emissions
for bp it is a race
the old company is undergoing its fastest growth in recent history with new oil and gas fields from egypt and oman to the gulf of mexico riding a tide of higher oil prices following the downturn
it is gradually paying off more than billion in penalties and costs for the deepwater horizon accident which left employees dead
regarding the danger of the company going bankrupt at the time dudley said the worst moment was when i heard that our debt was untradable back in the summer of to me that was a moment of the unthinkable was dudley says he no longer sees bp as an acquisition target after facing years of speculation it could be bought out
the company is focused on increasing production and cash flow while reducing its large debt pile after which it will consider boosting shareholder returns such as dividends although we re not at that point yet dudley said
challenges also loom
investors are increasingly pressing energy companies to find ways to adapt to the energy transition and dudley is looking to strike a balance between reducing a large carbon footprint while securing revenue
this is the great dual challenge that the industry and bp faces how to supply the world s energy on multiple fronts of growing population and doing it with less emissions said dudley who was appointed to the helm of bp months after the april spill
bp like rivals such as royal dutch shell is betting on natural gas the least polluting hydrocarbon to sustain an expected surge in demand for electricity as economies grow and transportation is electrified
gas is also playing a key role as a to renewable energy such as wind and solar in power generation
to that end bp is expanding its gas production through new projects in oman egypt and trinidad and tobago
gas already accounts for over percent of its production
i am optimistic about the climate change if you can combine renewables wind and solar and natural gas
to me that s part of the big answer dudley said in an interview with reuters
in the early bp introduced the slogan beyond petroleum and adopted a sunburst logo after launching an billion expansion into renewables
the company was forced to write off its solar business years later but still retains a large onshore wind business and biofuels plants
now dudley is taking a cautious approach investing in smaller companies in renewables clean fuels and battery charging docks
we have to go slow and pick the right low carbon fuels he said
bp will be a company that supplies all forms of energy that are needed that can be done the company will invest million per year in energy and technology in the coming years out of a total spending of to billion a range which dudley said the company could stay within
if a shareholder or someone else came to bp tomorrow and said here is billion to invest in low carbon energies for us we would not know how to do that bp is also expanding its vast global network of petrol stations and investing in convenience stores and charging spots hoping to retain its dominant brand as electric vehicles become more popular
i m not worried about bp in this area
the most strategic thing we can do is to get our balance sheet strong so that when we have the firepower we can do anything in these bp expects demand for oil to peak in the late after which it will plateau and gradually decline
for bp whose roots go back to with the discovery of iran s first oil field the days of the black gold are far from dead
while oil prices in recent weeks have hit their highest levels since late at a barrel bp are working on an assumption that prices will remain at a range of per barrel due to surging shale output and opec s ability to crank up output
mega projects involving complex facilities such as huge offshore platforms that came to symbolize the technological prowess of the world s top oil companies are most likely a thing of the past dudley said
instead bp is opting for phased developments that require less capital and less time to construct which make them easier to control at a time of uncertainty over oil prices
many of the companies in the industry are remembering the lesson learned during the oil era which is take it in phases dudley said
bp is applying this approach in many of its main production hubs such as egypt and gulf of mexico where it can continue raising production into the early dudley said
bp s oil and gas output is set to reach around million bpd by the end of the decade a level last seen in with more than a fifth of that coming from projects started since
it is partnering with top oil producing nations which have some of the lowest costs of extraction such as oman azerbaijan and most importantly russia where bp has a percent stake in rosneft and where it draws one third of its production
bp has a relatively small shale business focused mostly on gas but dudley is considering growing in the sector which has attracted billions of dollars in investments in recent years
shale comes down to economics and competitiveness on what is on offer
so far they feel overheated it is not a burning need to fill that in the portfolio but if it is attractive we bp could place a bid for bhp billiton s shale assets dudley said
bp s position in russia has put the firm in the spotlight as the united states and europe tighten sanctions on moscow
dudley who sits on the board of rosneft believes bp can continue there and act as a bridge between countries
we don t apologize for doing business in russia said dudley
certainly today within the boundaries of the sanctions we can and do operate without bp will continue to operate in russia and expand projects with rosneft even though the company has had to turn down certain offers to develop projects offshore or in the arctic he said
dudley also said bp remained committed to its stake in rosneft which it received following the sale of
