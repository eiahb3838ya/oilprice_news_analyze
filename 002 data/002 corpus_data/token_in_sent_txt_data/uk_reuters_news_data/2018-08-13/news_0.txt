mexico's lopez obrador pledges more than $11 bln for refineries
mexico city aug reuters mexican andres manuel lopez obrador said on monday his administration will invest more than billion to boost refining capacity in order to curb growing fuel imports
lopez obrador who will take office on told reporters his government plans to invest billion to modernize existing domestic refineries owned and operated by national oil company pemex and spend another billion to build a new one within three years
the figure is higher than a billion estimate provided by a key energy advisor during the campaign
lopez obrador set to become mexico s first leftist president in decades did not detail how the projects would be financed or whether private capital would be involved but he has often said he will not raise taxes or grow government debt
mexico is among latin america s largest crude exporters but is also the biggest importer of refined products
the country s next president has pledged to lift refining capacity which he says has declined due to corruption and neglect
pemex formally known as petroleos mexicanos has six domestic refineries with a total processing capacity of some million barrels per day bpd but the facilities are only operating at about percent of capacity so far this year
meanwhile gasoline and diesel imports have in recent months amid planned and unplanned refinery stoppages
pemex has posted losses in its refining division for years but lopez obrador aims to boost crude processing enough to halt imports within three years
lopez obrador also said he plans to invest another billion to drill new onshore and oil wells in the states of veracruz tabasco and chiapas
pemex production has consistently declined in recent years to fall below million bpd after hitting peak output of million bpd in
president enrique pena nieto passed a reform to open up mexico s energy industry to private producers which has led to a series of competitive auctions that have awarded more than oil exploration and production contracts
lopez obrador has said he will respect those contracts as long as an ongoing review does not find signs of corruption
he is widely expected to slow down the process of offering more contracts to private players
