feature-villages die as community makes way for coal in germany
immerath germany aug thomson reuters foundation for four generations portz family life has focused around a quaint farmhouse and the fertile fields beyond ready for early harvest after this summer s high heat
soon the family will pull its last potato and final spike of grain from the rich immerath soil
big coal is coming to replace their agrarian way of life
the portz matriarch puts on a brave face as she folds laundry in her yard the ground strewn with toys
it s always jolly here christiane portz told the thomson reuters foundation interrupted by a chatter of grandchildren who make noisily for the stable
the singsong voices the spill of toys everything will go when the home is bulldozed and replaced with a vast coal mine
immerath once a small village of in germany s western frontier host to both farms and industry has fallen quiet
the portz family is one of the last households still in situ they live among piles of rubble after neighbouring families were resettled k west at new immerath
roughly billion tons of lignite a soft coal were discovered long ago under the village and its surrounding land in germany s north rhine westphalia state
few locals took the threat seriously so life continued until development of the mine became reality and villages were lined up for destruction
immerath is one of the last to make way for the expansion of garzweiler opencast mine which is run by giant german energy provider rwe supplying one third of germany s overall power
once garzweiler is finished villages will have gone
under the scheme some people will be forced to move compensated with either a new house or cash
rwe says almost half of locals just take the money
our expectation is that garzweiler will be open until the middle of the century rwe press officer guido steffen told the thomson reuters foundation
germany is making radical changes but even in the long run in order to provide energy we can t forgo conventional power once finished the company website says the mine will cover an operating surface of about sq km
the size of the approved mining field is sq km it says
the plan to expand was no shock for locals
it was back in the when nearby villages first made way for coal extraction despite loud community protests and protesters say the march of commerce over community continues nationwide
germany s environmental agency says the federal mining act prioritises the extraction of raw materials over the interests of the common good
since hundreds of villages yielded to a growing need for energy with percent of germany s power coming from coal
rwe europe s top emitter of carbon dioxide admits lignite is cheap to produce but harmful for the environment
we aim to halve emissions by percent by rwe s steffen said
what s left of immerath and other nearby villages is eerie streets and abandoned houses
the noise of the bulldozers is omnipresent as they rumble through the ghost towns
immerath s village church lovingly dubbed the cathedral by locals who financed its construction years ago was demolished in january
in new immerath a simple modern church has usurped the imposing towered cathedral
the portz family is due to leave in september
it is what it is said portz who is in her and helps run the farm
we ve known the day would arrive and we all need portz insists she is positive about her new home too
the old farmhouse will be swallowed by the mine and the family will move to three modern houses k away
her husband who grew up on the family farm and has watched two more generations do the same does not take change lightly
it s a nightmare
i think about it constantly said her husband who did not want to give his first name
aside from the human cost to families like his campaigners count the wider environmental fallout
it is absolutely unacceptable that coal companies like rwe still want to destroy homes and nature for dirty lignite
it is inefficient and not able to be a flexible partner for clean renewables like wind and solar power said campaigner anike peters of greenpeace
along with local residents greenpeace and other groups have protested against the forced resettlement and say they plan to step up the demonstrations
local resistance against lignite is stronger than ever
we want the coal to stay in the ground said johanna winter of klimacamp an initiative organised to protect the environment
more protests are planned this month against what maja rothe also of klimacamp calls a clear example of the rules of capitalism putting boundaries to about km from immerath sits berverath a small farming village squeezed between green fields and apple trees
it is due to be destroyed in and local agronomist elionore kreins is fighting hard for her farm s survival
during a first meeting with rwe a representative told us that our emotions are out of immediately after we decided to get legal help she told the thomson reuters foundation from a wooden bench at her farm
costs are steep up to euros an hour and the family has not yet sold its land
once sold rwe finances the resettlement
we are expropriated and our lifestyle will have to change
keeping animals in town is allowed in berverath but it won t be possible in new berverath so farmers have to rethink she said
both her children and parents live on the farm and kreins takes care of her elderly mother
the rules mean her animals can not figure in her new life
it s true steffen admitted
the new villages have to abide by new building regulations
the old villages will look like modern suburbs with detached houses and small lignite extraction is due to start in the village by and will continue until about
once finished the area will be flooded with rhine water and turned into a lake
the destruction of villages like berverath must be completely avoided said greenpeace s peters
germany must phase out coal until at the back in immerath a small house still stands at the village entrance
a sign above the door reads heimat roughly translated as
but this very german concept also carries a sense of a feeling of belonging and roots
empty and lifeless the house now sits with its blinds down and its driveway overgrown waiting for the bulldozer to call
