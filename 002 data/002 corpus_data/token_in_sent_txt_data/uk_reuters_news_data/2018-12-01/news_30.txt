french police brace for more violent protests over rising fuel costs
paris dec reuters french authorities have drafted thousands of additional police officers into paris ahead of a third demonstration on saturday by protesters angry at high fuel prices as security officials warned of renewed violence
for more than two weeks the yellow vests have blocked roads across france in a spontaneous popular rebellion against diesel tax hikes and the high cost of living
it has grown into one of the largest and most stubborn challenges emmanuel macron has faced in his presidency
a week ago thousands of protesters who have no leader and have largely organised themselves online converged on paris for the first time turning the champs elysees into a battlezone as they clashed with police firing tear gas and water canon
we re worried that small groups of rioters that aren t yellow vests will infiltrate the demonstration to fight security forces and challenge the authority of the state said denis jacob secretary general of the alternative police union
given the high level of security around the champs the fear is thugs will go to other places he said
officials said they expected some police and gendarmes in paris up from about last saturday
another will be deployed across the country for other yellow vests protests
workmen erected metal barriers and plywood boards on the facades of restaurants and boutiques lining paris most famous avenue on friday
the champs elysees will be closed to traffic and pedestrians will be funnelled through checkpoints
there s a lot of incitement on social media and we are expecting excess and violence david michaux of the unsa police union told reuters adding that and groups were expected
three protests are officially planned across paris on saturday including the yellow vests a union protest against unemployment and a separate demonstration against racism
for now the yellow vests who take their name from the jackets all motorists in france must carry in their vehicles enjoy widespread public support
when they began the protests caught macron just as he was trying to counter a plunge in popularity with his approval at barely percent
his unyielding response has exposed him to charges of being out of touch with ordinary people
