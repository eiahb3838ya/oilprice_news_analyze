citing russia threat, ukraine boosts security at ports, power plants
kiev reuters ukrainian president petro poroshenko said on saturday his country had stepped up security at vital infrastructure sites such as nuclear power stations and black sea ports in the face of what he called a russian test of the world order
russia opened fire on and seized three ukrainian navy ships and their crews on in an incident which moscow and kiev have blamed on each other triggering a crisis that has raised fears of a wider conflict
poroshenko on saturday repeated allegations that russia had amassed a large military force in eastern ukraine which is controlled by separatists and in crimea which russia annexed from ukraine in
russia has deployed land forces of around russian troops about artillery and missile systems tanks armoured vehicles about planes and helicopters poroshenko wrote on twitter
moscow had also built up a powerful naval force in the black sea and the sea of azov which russia and ukraine share he said
ukrainian tv channel ukraine on saturday showed poroshenko presenting new and overhauled military aircraft helicopters and drones to the ukrainian army
ukraine had stepped up security at critical infrastructure sites including at nuclear and hydroelectric power plants chemical factories and at ports on the black sea and the sea of azov poroshenko said
ukraine has introduced martial law in parts of the country for days and poroshenko said on saturday military reservists in those areas would practice mobilising and that military factories would be changing the way they worked too
russian president vladimir putin has dismissed last weekend s black sea clash as a minor border incident and accused poroshenko of engineering what he called a provocation to boost his flagging popularity before an election next year
russian politicians have also said they believe the military phase of the confrontation is over
the incident took place near the kerch strait between crimea and southern russia which controls access to the sea of azov location of both russian and ukrainian ports
