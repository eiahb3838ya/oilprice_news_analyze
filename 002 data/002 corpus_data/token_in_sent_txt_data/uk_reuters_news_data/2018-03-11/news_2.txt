update 5-rwe, e.on reshape german power sector in innogy asset swap deal
reuters germany s top utilities on sunday announced plans to break up innogy whose assets will be divided among parent rwe and rival in the sector s biggest overhaul since a landmark move to exit nuclear power
the deal which includes making a billion euro billion takeover offer to innogy s minority shareholders spells the end of the network renewables and retail energy group carved out from rwe two years ago as a standalone unit
chancellor angela merkel s decision to abandon nuclear power after japan s fukushima nuclear disaster in has forced the sector to radically restructure in order to survive and already caused major plant shutdowns and billions of euros of losses
peter altmaier the next economy minister and a close ally of merkel said the deal was a consequence of that shift known as the energiewende in german
the companies had to adapt he told the rheinische post newspaper
through the deal which includes a share issue and asset swaps will acquire innogy s prized regulated energy networks and customer operations while rwe will take on the renewables businesses of both and innogy
that would position rwe which relies heavily on coal and power plants as a champion of the shift away from fossil fuels towards a more sustainable mix of energy sources
rwe kept percent of innogy after the
a source involved in the deal said it would be slightly more beneficial to which would become a bigger regulated business by adding more networks while rwe would end up owning interests in the riskier and more competitive renewables sector
the source said that had been in a better bargaining position after rwe shopped innogy to other european rivals including france s engie italy s enel and spain s iberdrola without striking a deal
this looks like an advantageous step for at first glance said thomas deser fund manager at union investment which holds shares in rwe and innogy
through the renewable pipeline rwe too should be able to offset its dwindling nuclear and lignite business as well as attract partners for the expansion of its wind the transaction comes less than two years after and rwe both split up their businesses to separate legacy fossil fuel power plants from more promising networks and renewable assets
in january agreed to sell a remaining percent stake in its power plant and trading unit uniper which it spun off in to finland s fortum a deal expected to close later this year
the swap will also hand rwe germany s biggest electricity producer a percent stake in by way of a percent capital increase
rwe will pay another billion euros to to close a valuation gap that results from the complex structure of the asset swaps
the transactions which still require approval from the company s boards face scrutiny by european union regulators as well as from germany s federal cartel office which did not respond to an emailed request for comment
the european commission declined to comment
innogy has been in turmoil since chief executive peter terium resigned in december in the wake of a profit warning and chief financial officer bernhard guenther fell victim to a recent acid attack
innogy has been the target of persistent takeover talk with sources saying recently that rwe had talked to engie and italy s enel about a possible deal
other firms linked to innogy included iberdrola and australian bank macquarie an acquisitive infrastructure investor
innogy reports its annual results on monday while rwe does so on tuesday and on wednesday
the supervisory boards of both rwe and were due to meet on sunday to review the deal according to people familiar with the matter
rwe s municipal shareholders vka which jointly hold about percent in the group were caught by the announcement and said the plans would have to be thoroughly examined
if approved the deal could result in synergies of about million euros analysts at bernstein estimate pointing to on the customer support side
labour sources welcomed the plans saying that each company individually was unable to fund the networks renewables and customer business in an adequate ways but added talks about job protection would be a key demand
under the proposed transaction would make a voluntary cash offer to buy rwe s innogy stake valued at euros per share said in a filing issued early on sunday
innogy shares closed at euros on friday
this price includes an offer of euros per share plus assumed dividends of innogy for the fiscal years and in the total aggregate amount of euros per share said
rwe will not participate in the offer
also agreed to transfer most of its renewables business to rwe including minority interests currently held by s subsidiary preussenelektra in the nuclear power plants emsland and gundremmingen
rwe in turn will receive innogy s renewables and gas storage business as well as innogy s stake in austrian energy supplier kelag said
