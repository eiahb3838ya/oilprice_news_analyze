update 3-iraqi parliament approves budget, kurdish lawmakers boycott vote
iraq passes state budget pm abadi declared victory over the group in december kurdish lawmakers boycott vote over reduced budget share baghdad at odds with kurds after independence attempt global slump in crude price war devastate iraq s economy sources figures to final bill clarifies krg allocation by ahmed aboulenein and ahmed rasheed baghdad march reuters iraq s parliament approved a budget on saturday the first since declaring victory over islamic state after three years of war but kurdish lawmakers boycotted the vote over their region s diminished allocation
the budget of trillion iraqi dinars billion is based on projected oil exports of million barrels per day bpd at a price of a copy of the final bill showed
it envisions government revenues of trillion dinars billion with a deficit of trillion dinars billion
parliament was meant to pass the budget before the start of the financial year in january but all three main blocs shi ite arabs sunni arabs and kurds had serious issues with the government s proposal
we boycotted the vote and there are proposals for kurdistan to withdraw from the entire political process in iraq over the unfair treatment we have received said kurdish mp ashwaq jaff
the budget cut the kurdistan regional government s krg share from the percent the region has traditionally received since the fall of saddam hussein
it did not specify a percentage to be allocated to the krg instead stipulating it would receive funds proportional to its share of the population
in a previous draft the krg portion was set at percent which is how much of iraq s population baghdad says the provinces in kurdistan make up
the krg disputes that estimation
the kurds overwhelmingly voted to secede in an independence referendum in september which was opposed by baghdad
in october iraqi forces retook disputed territories including the oil city of kirkuk that had came under kurdish control in and baghdad imposed sanctions on the krg such as suspending international flights from kurdish airports
baghdad and the krg had been engaged in talks for months about the sanctions and kurdistan s share of the budget
the government said on tuesday it had reached an agreement with the kurds to resume kirkuk oil exports through turkey s ceyhan port but gave no precise timeline
the projected million bpd exports in the budget includes a bpd contribution from the kurdistan region lawmakers said on saturday
it was not immediately clear what effect the kurdish boycott of the vote would have on that
shi ite lawmakers wanted more spending allocated to the southern predominantly shi ite provinces as well as greater salaries and benefits for the shi ite militias known as popular mobilisation forces who helped iraq s security forces defeat islamic state
sunni lawmakers wanted more allocated towards reconstructing areas retaken from the militants which were predominantly sunni
the areas include iraq s second city mosul
on thursday the three presidencies of iraq its shi ite prime minister sunni parliament speaker and kurdish president had met to discuss how to push the budget through
prime minister haider congratulated iraqis over the passing of the budget on saturday and said it was the result of cooperation between the executive and legislative branches
speaker salim said the budget addressed kurdish concerns and that the federal government would pay the salaries of kurdish civil servants and peshmerga fighters as well as welfare entitlements
baghdad had stopped paying salaries or making budget transfers to the kurdish regional capital erbil in when the kurds started independently selling oil
oil exports iraq s main source of revenue have risen above million barrels per day this year but a global slump in prices for crude compounded by the costs of rebuilding an infrastructure damaged by the war against islamic state have battered the country s finances
