india's solar financing may have peaked for now at $10 bln in 2017 -consultancy
new delhi reuters india s solar industry more than doubled its fund raising to billion in clean energy consultancy mercom said but activity is likely to slow this year as new delhi plans to slap high tariffs on imports
prime minister narendra modi has set a target of raising india s solar power generation to gigawatt gw by five times current levels
the government says india will need to raise at least billion to reach its goal of generating gw of energy from all renewable sources in five years
new and rooftop solar installations in india jumped to gw last year compared with the addition of gw in mercom said but predicted additional installations will fall by percent to gw this year
the lower forecast reflects a smaller pipeline of projects scheduled for commissioning in mercom said
auction activity was not very robust in and though there was a surge in activity at the end of the year most of the projects that were tendered are not likely to be commissioned until mercom called a proposal by india s safety watchdog to impose a percent duty on imports of solar equipment from china and some other countries to protect domestic manufacturers as an unexpected and aggressive recommendation that has brought the industry to a standstill
any duty would hurt big project developers in india such as softbank sb energy but would be good for local solar component makers such as indosolar and moser baer which have struggled to compete with chinese companies such as trina solar and yingli
reuters also reported in january that solar modules worth more than million were stuck at various indian ports due to a dispute over their classification and the import tax applicable to them
most of the modules come from china but several consignments were held up because customs officials demanded that some of them be classified as electric motors and generators attracting a percent duty not as diodes transistors and similar devices with no duty
india aims for renewable energy to make up percent of installed power capacity by compared with percent at the end of and the ministry of new and renewable energy said in january it was looking to address issues facing solar companies
the imposition of any additional duties would make solar more expensive and potentially scare away financially strapped distribution companies who are looking to procure the cheapest power generation source available mercom said
