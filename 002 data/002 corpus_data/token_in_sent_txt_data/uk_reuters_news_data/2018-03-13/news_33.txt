shunning renewables, omv attracts investors with low-cost fossil fuels
reuters while other european energy firms are flocking to renewables austria s omv is sticking with fossil fuels and telling investors it will deliver rising dividends lower costs and free cash flow at just a barrel
the strategy seems to be working
omv has outperformed peers with its shares up about percent in the past months against a percent drop in the sector
over two years the gap widens with omv up percent and the sector up percent
presenting its new targets to in london on tuesday chief executive rainer seele who has halved production costs per barrel to around in part by rapidly expanding in russia had no qualms about his commitment to a future
we will not engage in renewables
it s not part of our strategy
i can not do everything he said outlining omv s spending programme to
seele s comments come as other european energy companies such as shell bp plc total sa and statoil are becoming increasingly active in green energy seeking to position themselves for the future
shell alone has spent million on renewables and electric car charging points in recent months
analysts at bernstein reckon big oil has invested more than billion on renewables acquisitions over the past five years mostly solar
gas the least polluting fossil fuel is widely expected to be crucial for reducing emissions
omv is aiming for the gas part of its portfolio to grow to up to percent of the total by from just under half
overall output is expected to almost double between and to barrels of oil equivalent per day
seele s predecessor had bet on north sea production where other producers such as premier are looking at costs of up to per barrel
but seele is slashing costs by selling british north sea assets reducing omv s norwegian footprint and boosting output in russia the middle east and new zealand
this allows omv to target costs at around per barrel through requiring the oil price to be just a barrel to generate free cash flow compared with the current market price of around
on that basis omv plans to keep or raise its dividend
it proposed its highest ever payout of euros a share for
by comparison bp needs a price of at least per barrel to break even this year and statoil around
omv s new growth strategy is encouraging despite some bold ambitions for profitable growth to jefferies which reaffirmed its buy rating on omv shares said in a note
the sustainable organic free cash flow yield of around percent to is one of the main attractions to this stock it said pointing to peers on below percent
