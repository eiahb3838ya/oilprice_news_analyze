update 2-nigeria to cut sulphur in fuels a year after un deadline
london reuters nigeria will begin cutting the sulfur levels allowed in imported fuels in july a change long sought by health and environmental campaigners a year after an initial deadline an official at state oil company nnpc said
west african nations had promised higher quality by july as part of a united nations environmental programme unep campaign but only ghana met the deadline
nigeria imports roughly tonnes of gasoline every month accounting for percent of west african imports of the fuel meaning its choices on fuel quality are likely to impact the entire region
nigeria will lower the top level of sulfur in diesel to parts per million ppm from ppm by july anibor kragha nnpc s chief operating officer of refineries and petrochemicals said in a presentation to the african refiners association ara
gasoline sulfur level cuts a cost that will be borne largely by the government due to capped prices for the fuel will start in october moving to ppm from ppm
nigeria is targeting a cut to ppm by october kragha said
the standards organization of nigeria son the body responsible for setting requirements for imported goods published tighter quality rules last year but another government body the department of petroleum resources dpr did not issue revised specifications
james mccullagh analyst with energy aspects said that meant nnpc currently has the right rather than the obligation to actually import it cleaner fuels this latest move would merely crystallize that obligation he said
kragha told journalists in cape town that the ministries of environment health petroleum resources and industry and trade were working together to finalize rules that would be distributed to importers at some point in the second quarter
unep the ara and health campaigners have been pushing west african nations to ban fuels that have been illegal in europe and the united states for years due to what they say are significant health problems associated with sulfur emissions particularly in dense urban areas such as lagos
the region is one of the last on earth where it is legal to sell fuels with sulfur levels at and above ppm as east and north african nations and major asian consumer countries such as china and india have already tightened rules
kragha in a presentation during ara week in cape town said that while nigeria was committed to cleaner fuel standards significant costs complicated efforts to meet the deadline
the presentation said that the first shift to cleaner gasoline would cost million per month and the second million per month
the diesel reduction would cost million per month
because gasoline prices are capped in nigeria and nnpc itself has been importing the bulk of it over the past year via crude for product swaps the government is likely to bear much of the initial costs for a cleaner specification
diesel prices are deregulated meaning consumers will pay directly for the fuels
nigeria s own oil refineries will have until to meet the new sulfur levels kragha said
