update 3-bankrupt philadelphia refiner settles biofuel obligation with epa -court filing
adds comments from biofuel groups by jarrett renshaw new york march reuters the environmental protection agency granted a bankrupt philadelphia oil refining company a reprieve from complying with the nation s renewable fuel laws according to a settlement agreement filed on monday
the refiner carlyle philadelphia energy solutions pes filed for bankruptcy protection in january and asked a judge to waive some million in compliance costs under the renewable fuel standard or rfs
the epa and pes agreed on monday that the refiner would only have to satisfy about half those costs but would face more scrutiny moving forward court documents showed
the settlement is facing early opposition from ethanol groups
the settlement comes amid a fight between powerful corn and oil interests in washington over the future of the rfs program
president donald trump has sought to bring the two sides together in recent weeks to come up with reforms that can lower the cost for refiners without hurting demand for biofuels wading into an issue that divides two important constituencies
the pes bankruptcy and the potential loss of jobs in a key electoral state had fueled calls for change
the rfs requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel or buy credits from those who do
pes which lacks blending facilities entered into bankruptcy owing million credits from and with only million credits in hand the filing showed
the epa said pes could comply with the program by turning over its available credits and would be excused from any shortfall a huge win for the refiner
it said the deal would cover the company up until the point it exits bankruptcy
after exiting bankruptcy pes would have to comply with the law on a basis as opposed to annually and submit itself to more epa scrutiny
it would face penalties for with the agreement
neither epa nor pes responded to requests for comment
pes has blamed its financial woes on the cost of buying the
but reuters reported that other factors may also have played a role in the bankruptcy including the withdrawal of more than million in payments from the company by its investor owners
the private equity firm carlyle group rescued the refinery from shutting in putting up million for majority control of the company
the majority of the dividends paid to the investor group were backed by loans taken against the refinery s assets
the deal will be open for public comment for days before it is finalized and biofuel groups are showing early opposition
under this settlement it looks like the carlyle group gets to keep that cash while avoiding investing in biofuels and job security for philadelphia workers
if that s the case this is a massive handout brooke coleman head of the advanced biofuels council said
bob dinneen ceo of the renewable fuels association said the group was still evaluating the settlement but at first blush this strikes us as rewarding bombast behavior and it sets an extraordinarily bad the case is kg in the bankruptcy court for the district of delaware
