kosovo finds temporary fix for energy glitch slowing europe's clocks
march reuters kosovo has found a fix for a gap in europe s power grid which has slowed electric timers across much of the continent but officials warned on tuesday the problem may unless a network row with serbia is resolved for good
european grid lobby said last week the continental european network had been short of of energy because kosovo had taken more power than it produced while serbia which is in charge of balancing kosovo s grid had failed to fill the gap between and march
as a result the european network s frequency had deviated from its standard of hertz hz to hz and some electric clocks steered by the frequency of the power system rather than by a quartz crystal have lost nearly six minutes
we have already returned percent of the missing energy and that energy will have to be compensated by the end of this month a senior kosovo energy official told reuters on condition of anonymity
he said the government had allocated million euros million to buy electricity to compensate for the shortfall and avoid any similar problems in future
but the association of european grid operators said the country of million people might need between million and million euros to compensate for the shortfall
if there is no more money then we will have the same situation again the kosovo official warned
kosovo seceded from serbia in
belgrade which still refuses to recognise kosovo committed to normalise relations with pristina key to its progress towards european union membership
but little progress has been made
a spokeswoman for said a deal must be reached and the energy put back into the system to restore the frequency
the outstanding point as to avoid any repetition is that several legal energy issues between kosovo and serbia have to be set
the discussions are ongoing and involve us from a technical side but also of course the european commission susanne nies said
officials say the problem emerged after a pristina court ruling in december to end a practice by which kosovars living south of the river ibar had been receiving higher bills to compensate for power consumption by serbs in the north of the country who do not recognise kosovo institutions and refuse to pay the kosovo grid operator
following the court decision kosovo s energy regulator ordered its grid operator kostt to trim the tariff by percent
kostt did not have the legal and financial ability to assume the obligation to further cover the losses for power supply to the northern part it told reuters
another senior energy official said
we had two solutions to cut the electricity to people hospitals water companies and trigger violent protests by serbs or sit down and watch
we decided to sit down and official figures show the uncollected debt now amounts to over million euros
serbia s grid operator ems has obstructed kostt s efforts to become a member though kostt says all requirements have been met
both countries in signed an agreement on operating their grids but it has never been enacted
the two sides have conflicting claims about ownership of the power grid in kosovo built when it was part of serbia
kostt says the row cost it million euros in as ems continues to benefit from the allocation of capacity from kosovo s interconnectors with neighbouring countries
ems declined to comment
