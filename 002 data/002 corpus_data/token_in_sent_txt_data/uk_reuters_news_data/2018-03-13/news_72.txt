australia to stress international law in south china sea dispute
sydney reuters australian foreign minister julie bishop will on tuesday hail the role of international law in settling regional conflicts comments apparently aimed at bolstering australian efforts to build a coalition against chinese assertiveness
bishop in a speech ahead of a special meeting of the association of south east asian nations asean in sydney will not name china but will argue that international law will stabilise a region strained by rival claims in the south china sea
the order is designed to regulate behaviour and rivalries of and between states and ensure countries compete fairly and in a way that does not threaten others or destabilise their region or the world bishop will say in sydney according to a leaked draft of the speech seen by the australian financial review

australia a staunch ally with no claim to the south china sea has long maintained its neutrality on the dispute to protect economic relationship with china
but with australia s relations with china souring in recent months bishop s comment underscore a new australian tactic
