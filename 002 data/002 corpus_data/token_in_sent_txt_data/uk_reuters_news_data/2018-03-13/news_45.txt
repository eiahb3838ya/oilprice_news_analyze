update 3-s.african pro-zuma group blocks energy deals in blow to ramaphosa
group union say deals to hurt coal sector billion green energy deals a test for new government anc divisions risk hobbling ramaphosa s reforms adds transform rsa comment by joe brock johannesburg march reuters south african president cyril ramaphosa was dealt a political blow on tuesday after a legal challenge by a group loyal to ousted leader jacob zuma blocked the signing of billion in renewable energy deals
the north gauteng high court agreed to hold a full hearing on the challenge on march after the national union of metalworkers numsa and transform rsa a group which has lobbied for zuma in the past on monday argued the deals would lead to job losses and should be scrapped
state power utility eskom was due to sign mostly wind power and solar deals with independent power producers ipps in the first major investment deal since ramaphosa replaced zuma last month
we are confident that the court will recognise that our rights have been violated numsa said
the projects were delayed for two years under zuma as he pursued a billion nuclear power plan
ramaphosa a wealthy businessman has made revamping the economy a top priority
but many investors are concerned about his ability to push through reforms given deep divisions in the ruling african national congress anc
zuma reluctantly resigned last month under sustained pressure from sections of the anc but his allies remain in roles in the party and are opposed to ramaphosa
given our history it is natural that you suspect ulterior political motives in the court application said dominic wills a director at sola future energy one of the energy companies involved in the deals
transform rsa which wrote a letter to the anc leadership in january saying removing zuma would put the country in jeopardy denied it was motivated by political ends
transform rsa is a grassroots lobby organisation the group s president adil nchabeleng told reuters
we are opposed to the prohibitive cost of the ipp the energy ministry said in a statement it decided not to sign the contracts until after the court ruling and reaffirmed its commitment to expanding green energy programmes
some investors remained positive
i m still fairly optimistic these deals will be signed
when you look at the cold hard facts about our economy these are the sort of deals that need to be done wills said
numsa and transform rsa argue that a switch to renewable energy would increase electricity costs for poor south africans
energy analyst chris yelland however said the cost of renewable energy had fallen significantly and it was now cheaper than new coal and nuclear projects
south africa relies on plants for more than percent of its electricity generation while renewables contribute around percent
eskom is one of the world s largest producers of greenhouse gases
ultimately this application is futile and economic sense will prevail
south africa must transform from a dirty energy economy to a cleaner energy economy yelland said
south africa s renewable power programme was the in the world seven years ago attracting billion of investment into wind farms and solar projects involving a cluster of new ipps backed by foreign investment
over the past two years eskom stopped signing renewable energy contracts and focused instead on a plan to build a fleet of nuclear power plants in a deal that some members of the anc and rights groups said would be open to corruption
eskom s former board is being investigated by parliament over allegations it siphoned off state funds to companies controlled by the gupta family businessmen friends of zuma
zuma and the guptas deny any wrongdoing
