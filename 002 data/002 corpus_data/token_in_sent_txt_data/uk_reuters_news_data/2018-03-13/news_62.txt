china shake-up gives climate change responsibility to environment ministry
ministry to take over climate carbon duties from state planner shift comes as china struggles with market plans responsibilities for river land sea pollution to be absorbed by david stanway shanghai march reuters china will hand over a slew of new responsibilities for river marine and soil pollution as well as climate change to a environment ministry it said on tuesday part of its biggest in years
the ministry of environmental protection mep will be transformed into the ministry for ecological environment and will absorb environmental duties formerly held by the land water and agriculture ministries china s parliament said
in a bid to take on polluters china has been strengthening its environment ministry drawing up new laws setting up monitoring systems and launching campaigns to boost compliance by heavy industries
with the new management structure the efforts for air water soil and ecological protection will be more coordinated said tonny xie director of the secretariat for the clean air alliance of china caac
it is also a sign that china will continue the unprecedented commitment and investment to improve environmental quality in future which will generate significant market potential for clean the enlarged body will also absorb functions from the state oceanic administration and from the cabinet office in charge of a huge water project aimed at easing drought in the north by diverting rivers from the south
climate change and growth were previously the responsibility of the powerful state planner the national development and reform commission ndrc and switching them to the new ministry could aid coordination said li shuo a senior climate adviser with environmental group greenpeace
but much more detail including who heads which department is needed to tell if it is a net positive move he said adding that the ndrc had been a champion of climate policy
the ndrc s climate role was partly a legacy of veteran climate change official xie zhenhua who joined it in after resigning from what was then the state environmental protection administration in the wake of a toxic benzene leak in northeastern china
it is logical to transfer these duties said shawn he an environmental lawyer with a law firm huamao guigu
but the ndrc was very effective at pushing forward climate policies because its powers are immense and it can play a role that no other ministry can play in terms of implementing its the switch comes as china struggles to meet pledges to launch a nationwide carbon trading system
beijing was forced to scale back ambitions late last year amid technical problems
it will involve lots of efforts and coordination and i don t know whether the new ministry will have the authority to do that said he
ultimately the power of environmental regulators in china will depend on its leaders determination to battle the outcome of more than three decades of untrammelled economic growth
it is the party that gets its act together on issues such as air pollution and not the ministry said li of greenpeace referring to the ruling communist party
