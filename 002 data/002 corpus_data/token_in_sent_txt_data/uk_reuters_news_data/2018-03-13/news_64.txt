mongolia president appeals to u.s. for trade to protect democracy
ulaanbaatar reuters mongolia s president has appealed to president donald trump for more trade between their countries saying an economic downturn has threatened to destabilise the young asian democracy sandwiched between china and russia
mongolia s role as an oasis of democracy in a region where authoritarianism in on the rise does not contribute to economic development mongolian president khaltmaa battulga said in a letter to trump dated march and published on his website
battulga said prosperity was coming too slowly
ordinary mongolian citizens have become discouraged by democracy and have begun to doubt our choice he said
mongolia is emerging from an economic crisis after agreeing to a billion billion economic bailout from the international monetary fund last year which helped stabilise its currency and relieve debt pressures
a resurgence in the coal trade in the region also helped boost growth to percent last year compared with just percent in
but mongolia exported just million worth of goods to the united states last year according to mongolia s national statistics office
its total exports stood at billion with the bulk going south to china
trade with the united states was less than percent of its total last year and a decision to allow imports of mongolian clothing would help ensure economic stability battulga said
he also called for easier visa conditions for mongolian citizens
the united states is one of mongolia s third neighbours which mongolia uses to balance relations with heavyweight neighbours china and russia
battulga told trump that trade and investment could help prevent mongolia from moving in a more authoritarian direction
i am confident that supporting mongolia s economic security will play a prominent role in your country s foreign policy he wrote
