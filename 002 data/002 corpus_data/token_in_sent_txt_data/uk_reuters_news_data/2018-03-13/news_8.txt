update 4-u.s. biofuels sector blasts epa settlement with bankrupt philadelphia refinery
philadelphia reuters the environmental protection agency s decision to grant a bankrupt philadelphia refiner relief from biofuel laws drew criticism on tuesday from the country s biofuels sector and its allies who said it sets a bad precedent
the epa and the carlyle philadelphia energy solutions refinery agreed on monday that the refiner will have to satisfy only roughly half of its million in outstanding compliance obligations under the renewable fuel standard rfs
the rfs requires refiners to blend biofuels such as ethanol into their fuel or buy credits known as rins from those that do
independent refiners including some as large as valero energy corp have long complained about the rfs standards saying it has boosted costs as the price of credits rose from just a few cents in to more than at times in and
however biofuels companies say the standards are critical to midwest farmers and help produce cleaner fuels like ethanol
industry representatives complained about the epa settlement calling it a bailout for a mismanaged company
i am very troubled at the precedent this sets and there are discussions underway whether the epa has the legal standing to grant the relief
we are exploring our options said michael mcadams head of the advanced biofuels association
president donald trump has called several white house meetings to change the program
the epa has signaled it is willing to exempt more small refineries which would limit potential buyers for the credits
republican senator chuck grassley of iowa said the settlement raises a couple questions how are the rin obligations being treated compared to the other obligations of pes
does this set an unfair precedent for other refiners that continue to act in good faith to comply with the law pes was given relief on about half of its outstanding obligations
the company which lacks blending facilities entered into bankruptcy owing million credits from and with only million credits in hand the filing showed
the settlement puts pes on stable path to success and protects jobs cherice corley a company spokeswoman said in an email tuesday
but more needs to be done corley said
this is only a partial and temporary reprieve and we are hopeful that policymakers will substantively address the flawed rins compliance mechanism so that a restructured pes and other independent merchant refiners can finally compete on a level playing field corely said
pes got a huge win
it does not have to go into the market and buy some million in compliance credits covering and part of
the refiner can turn over its available credits to the epa and is excused from any shortfall
there s no denying it the epa settled in a way that was beneficial to the bankruptcy and this particular firm
it sends a bad signal about what the epa will accept in the future said scott irwin agricultural economist at the university of illinois
pes blamed its financial woes on the cost of buying the
but other factors contributed to the bankruptcy including withdrawal of more than million in payments from the company by its investor owners
private equity firm carlyle rescued the refinery from shutting in putting up million for majority control
most dividends paid to the investor group were backed by loans taken against refinery assets
monday s settlement alleviates fears that the refinery was going to be exempt from the program moving forward or be allowed to dump millions of credits onto the market traders said
the epa will now require pes to buy credits rather than annually
that makes it more difficult for the refinery the largest on the east coast to build a large short position or defer its obligations and risk getting into a hole as it did in
prices for renewable fuel credits for were at cents on tuesday little changed from a day earlier having already lost percent in the last two weeks
prices for are selling at an unusual discount versus the prices in the wake of the pes settlement traders said
