the top diplomat flew into the chadian capital n djamena on the last day of a truncated tour of africa with stops in kenya ethiopia djibouti and nigeria all frontline partners against islamic state and al qaeda offshoots
it was his first diplomatic visit to the continent where many are still smarting from president donald trump s reported dismissal of states there as shithole countries in january

these steps i think are going to allow us to begin to normalise the travel relationship with chad he told reporters
a report on chad s progress was being prepared in washington and would be reviewed by trump next month tillerson said
we have to wait for the final report he added
tillerson who met chadian president idriss deby previously while serving as chief executive of exxonmobil said he was concerned about the presence of islamic militants in the sahel and called chad an important partner
in september the trump administration added chad along with north korea and venezuela to a list of countries whose citizens are restricted from travelling to the united states
that drew protests from chad and others including france which works closely with the chadian military
officials from the department of homeland security said at the time that chad had to failed to send proof that it had taken a number of security measures
chad s deby expressed his incomprehension about the ban during a meeting with tillerson on monday foreign minister cherif mahamat zene said

he held talks with president muhammadu buhari behind closed doors in the capital abuja
following their talks buhari s office issued a statement saying the president discussed plans to negotiate for the release of girls abducted from a school in the northeastern town of dapchi last month rather than use a military option
the girls are suspected of having been abducted by members of boko haram
tillerson also held a news conference with nigeria s foreign affairs minister geoffrey onyeama during which he said the united states was helping nigeria in the fight against the jihadist group and in the hunt for the missing girls
supporting equipping training and we can advise and provide information i think that s the best way we can help the government of nigeria secure the release of these girls which we hope will be done in a peaceful manner he said
in a statement issued later on monday the state department said that during tillerson s meeting with buhari the secretary of state recognized nigeria s leadership in efforts to defeat islamist militant groups in west africa and expressed concern about the recent attacks and abductions
