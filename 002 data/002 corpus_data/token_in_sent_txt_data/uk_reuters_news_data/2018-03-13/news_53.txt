shell, eni preempt any u.s. probe over nigeria with filings
london reuters oil giants royal dutch shell and eni have voluntarily filed to authorities internal probes into how they acquired a giant field in nigeria as the companies seek to fight corruption allegations in europe and africa
the filings to the department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec do not mean authorities are investigating shell or eni
but the move shows the companies are trying to preempt questions from the united states as they face one of the oil industry s graft trials in italy to begin in may in milan a pending trial in nigeria and an investigation in the netherlands
the case revolves around the purchase of a huge block off nigeria known as opl which holds an estimated billion barrels in reserves
italian prosecutors allege that bribes were paid in an effort to secure rights to the block in
a number of top executives from both companies including eni chief executive claudio descalzi and former shell foundation chairman malcolm brinded will face trial
under italian law a company can be held responsible if it is deemed to have failed to prevent or attempt to prevent a crime by an employee that benefited the company
both companies shares are traded on stock exchanges putting their foreign dealings in the scope of authorities
shell and eni on behalf of subsidiaries in entered deferred prosecution agreements with the doj over separate nigerian corruption allegations
those pacts dismissed charges after a certain period in exchange for fines and an agreement to fulfil a number of requirements
they concluded in and respectively
a company s disclosure of alleged foreign corruption to both the sec and the doj in the typically means the company believed authorities needed to be made aware of this and both agencies have the authority to prosecute under the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa said pablo quiñones executive director of the new york university school of law program on corporate compliance and enforcement
quiñones previously worked as chief of strategy policy and training at the doj s criminal fraud section a role that included helping to develop fcpa enforcement policy
the sec and the doj declined to comment on the company disclosures or whether they were looking into any allegations surrounding the block
eni noted its disclosure in an sec filing in which it said no evidence of wrongdoing on eni side were detected
shell has said publicly that it submitted the investigation to authorities and to britain s serious fraud office
shell and eni deny any wrongdoing
they say their payments for the block a total of billion were transparent legal and went directly into an escrow account controlled by the nigerian government
the companies and legal experts say the trial will last more than a year with potential appeals stretching several years beyond that
the risk for companies is of a prolonged period of exposure to open court allegations from a state prosecutor of impropriety anthony goldman of pm consulting said
that will be painful and the milan prosecutor charges that roughly billion of the payments were funnelled to a nigerian company called malabu oil and gas which had a disputed claim on the block and former oil minister dan etete who british and courts have said controlled malabu
reuters has been unable to reach etete or malabu for comment
shell has since said it knew some of the money would go to malabu to settle its claim though its own due diligence could not confirm who controlled the company
eni said it never dealt with etete or knew he controlled the company but that the government promised to settle all other claims on the block as part of their deal
if the evidence ultimately proves that improper payments were made by malabu or others to then current government officials in exchange for improper conduct relating to the settlement of the long standing legal disputes it is shell s position that none of those payments were made with its knowledge authorisation or on its behalf shell said in a statement
the proceedings have also brought together investigators in several countries with authorities in nigeria and the netherlands sending information to milan
a dutch team in raided shell offices as part of the investigation and a dutch law firm has asked prosecutors to consider launching a criminal case in the netherlands
i m not aware of many cases where this many jurisdictions have been at work for so long helping each other out
the amount of cooperation is very unusual said aaron sayne of the natural resource governance institute a group that advises countries on how to manage oil gas and mineral resources
a case by nigeria s financial watchdog the economic and financial crimes commission against defendants including the former attorney general of justice and oil and various senior managers current and former from shell and eni will continue in june
there has also been at least one effort to take away the asset
experts say it is worth billions and shell has spent millions developing it
eni intends to make a final investment decision this year on developing the block and said in corporate filings that the asset has a book value of billion euros billion
the italian court does not have the ability to rescind rights to the block and nigerian oil minister emmanuel ibe kachikwu has said the companies should continue to develop it
but in a lawsuit filed by the nigerian government against jpmorgan in london for the bank role in transferring money from the deal it called the agreement that facilitated shell and eni purchase unlawful and void
a jpmorgan spokeswoman previously said the firm considers the allegations made in the claim to be unsubstantiated and without merit
additionally a nigerian court last year briefly ordered the seizure of the block
that decision was later overturned and shell and eni say they are not worried about losing the asset
but the ruling and the language in the government suit against jpmorgan underscore the risk
it s a nice stable asset that could produce a lot of oil for a long time sayne said
