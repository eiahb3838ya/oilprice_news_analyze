graphic-is opec moving the goalposts for its oil market scoreline?
london reuters saudi arabia s proposals of new metrics to determine when the oil market is balanced signals a shift in opec s targets for a pact on supply cuts that has almost achieved the initial aim of reducing bloated inventories
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and nine other producers cut output from january by million barrels per day bpd with the aim of reducing crude stocks in industrialized oecd nations to the average
from a record billion barrels in july oecd stocks dropped to billion barrels in december falling million barrels during and now stand just million barrels above the average international energy agency iea data show
opec and its allies have been helped because the average is a moving target and has risen even as output curbs were in place
the average climbed to billion barrels in september from about billion barrels when the supply pact was sealed in late
after a period of surplus the target becomes easier over time as more surplus years are included said standard chartered head of commodities research paul horsnell
but as the oecd inventory target has shifted so has thinking in saudi arabia the world s biggest oil exporter that worked with russia to forge the global pact on cutting supplies
saudi energy minister khalid al falih says opec and its partners should look at metrics such as inventories oil in floating storage and crude in transit as they consider the future of the pact that is due to expire at the end of
those measures however are more difficult to monitor
oil demand has outstripped oecd consumption since
but inventories in nations tend to be held as strategic not commercial assets making them less transparent and less likely to shift with changes to demand or supply
falih has said it would be better to overbalance the market by which he means allowing oecd stocks to drop below the average rather than end the supply deal too early another hint that the pact s expiry could be pushed back
to assess whether supply and demand had achieved a sustainable balance opec could measure the amount of oil in storage against days of demand it covers
this would show whether consumption was enough to avoid rebuilding inventories
graphic global oil supply and demand fall into line the amount of oil stored in oecd nations is now equivalent to days of forward demand the lowest since february
in the two years to when the oil price hit about the number of days cover remained below
when opec and its partners sealed the supply deal in late november in the wake of an oil price plunge there were nearly days cover
but measuring forward cover may still only offer limited help to opec in determining the right time to reopen oil taps given output from the united states and other producers is climbing
this has capped oil prices around a barrel now after rising from below at the start of
pvm oil associates analyst tamas varga said opec and its partners must constantly remind the market that the alliance formed at the end of is more than a marriage of convenience and no divorce is contemplated even after stability is the iea says oil producers outside the supply pact raised output by about bpd in the months to january
if opec members libya and nigeria which are exempt from supply curbs are included the total rises to million bpd
by comparison world demand grew million bpd in
opec forecasts global demand will grow by million bpd in compared to the iea prediction of million bpd
opec also sees supply rising by million bpd in compared to the iea forecast of million bpd
opec and russia would probably be better off signaling a gradual approach or a tapering of sorts analysts at bank of lynch said adding they should signal output would only rise once the pact ends if oil prices held steady
