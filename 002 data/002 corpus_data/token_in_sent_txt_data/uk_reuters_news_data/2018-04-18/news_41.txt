exclusive-opec's new price hawk saudi arabia seeks oil as high as $100 - sources
reuters top oil exporter saudi arabia would be happy to see crude rise to or even a barrel three industry sources said a sign riyadh will seek no changes to an opec deal even though the agreement s original target is within sight
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and several other producers began to reduce supply in january in an attempt to erase a glut
they have extended the pact until december and meet in june to review policy
opec is closing in on the original target of the pact reducing industrialized nations oil inventories to their average
there is no indication yet however that saudi arabia or its allies want to wind down the supply cut
over the past year saudi arabia has emerged as opec s leading supporter of measures to boost prices a change from its more moderate stance in earlier years
iran once a keen opec price hawk now wants lower prices than saudi arabia
industry sources have linked this shift in saudi arabia s stance to its desire to support the valuation of state oil company aramco ahead of the kingdom s planned sale of a minority stake in an initial public offering
the supply cut has helped boost oil prices this year to a barrel the highest since november
oil began a slide from above a price that saudi arabia endorsed in in when growing supply from rival sources such as shale began to swamp the market
but the kingdom wants the rally to go further
two industry sources said a desired crude price of or even was circulated by senior saudi officials in briefings in recent weeks
we have come full circle a separate industry source said of the change in saudi thinking
i would not be surprised if saudi arabia wanted oil at until this ipo is out of the once the aramco share sale is done riyadh would still want higher prices to help fund initiatives such as vision an economic reform plan championed by crown prince mohammed bin salman
saudi arabia wants higher oil prices and yes probably for the ipo but it isn t just that an opec source said
look at the economic reforms and projects they want to do and the war in yemen
how are they going to pay for all that
they need higher to be sure opec and saudi arabia have no official price target and say the objective of the production cut is to balance supply and demand and reduce the inventory glut
but guidance on preferred price levels comes from officials speaking off the record and from industry sources who have discussed the issue with saudi officials
i personally think that now is the floor for oil prices a second opec source said
but opec is unlikely to make any changes in june maybe by the end of the year
the market still needs opec and its partners meet on june to review policy and before then a ministerial monitoring panel gathers in jeddah saudi arabia on april
by opec s parameters the deal has worked
oil stocks in developed economies in february stood a mere million barrels above the latest average down from million barrels above in january
the cuts have been even bigger than those specified in the deal thanks in part to a slide in venezuelan production due to an economic crisis in the south american country
compliance has reached percent according to opec meaning the organization s members have cut production by about million barrels per day bpd more than pledged
few opec sources call for an exit strategy
most officials are talking of introducing additional inventory metrics to assess the success of the deal and of a need to support investment in new production to avert any supply crunch
the impression is that oil prices are seen as not yet high enough to encourage sufficient oil investment
we will know what will be the good price when the market is balanced and we have enough investments the united arab emirates energy minister suhail told reuters last week
we need to have more investments the jeddah meeting of the joint ministerial monitoring committee is unlikely to change the parameters for assessing the deal s success mazroui and other opec officials said and sources see little chance of a major tweak in june
even if we reach the average before june it does not mean we just go and open the taps a third opec source said
we have to test editing by dale hudson
