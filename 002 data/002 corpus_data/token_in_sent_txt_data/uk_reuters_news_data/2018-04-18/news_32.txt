column-china, the highly problematic saviour of the global aluminium market? andy home
london reuters the shocks from the imposition of sanctions on oleg deripaska and his uc rusal aluminium empire are still rolling through the market
after rio tinto last week flagged it was declaring force majeure on some raw material contracts it warned today of potential adjustments to its aluminium guidance this year due to the sanctions
some of japan s major trading houses meanwhile have asked rusal to stop shipping aluminium for fear of secondary sanctions
japan imports around tonnes of russian aluminium every year equivalent to around percent of its total import needs
aluminium s previously supply chain is starting to crack along multiple fault lines
as supply fears grow the market s attention is turning to china as a potential source of aluminium
there are almost a million tonnes of the stuff sitting in warehouses registered with the shanghai futures exchange shfe
that metal will flow out of china if the price is right
but china s role as supplier of last resort is heavily laden with irony given the political push back against its exports of aluminium products
the world s largest producer is also suffering from its own turbulence
graphic on london and shanghai aluminium relative price performance in london the price of aluminium has been on a charge since the treasury announced the sanctions on april
at a current per tonne london metal exchange lme aluminium has gained over in the space of under two weeks
that has opened up a widening gap with shanghai prices which have reacted only mutedly to the excitement in london
however still higher prices will be needed for chinese aluminium to leave the country and fill the supply gaps opening up in the rest of the world according to analysts at cru
that s because exports of primary metal from china are subject to a percent export tax unlike exports of products which qualify for vat rebates
depending on market dynamics in both london and shanghai cru is looking for prices to approach to unlock the tonnes of metal sitting in shfe warehouses
but this is what will be necessary if rusal s own exports out of russia are blocked
cru was already anticipating a supply shortfall of around million tonnes outside of china before the sanctions according to cru s head of primary and products research eoin dinsmore
throw in the potential loss of tonnes of monthly exports from russia and there would be a critical need for chinese metal
goldman sachs agrees arguing that a complete cessation of rusal exports could lift prices to as high as
quantifying upside risks from russian sanctions april
the bank s view is that rusal will be restructured to bypass sanctions and allow both production and exports to continue but it has still lifted its price forecasts to factor in the uncertainty
the irony here is that china is already a huge exporter not of primary aluminium but rather of aluminium in the form of products
indeed such has been the flood of products out of the country that up to now the big issue for everyone else has been how to stop china exporting so much not how to stimulate it to export more
the united states has led the political push back against chinese product exports which rose another percent last year to an annual record of million tonnes
president donald trump has signed off on a import tax on all imports of aluminium with china firmly in the administration s sights
separately the united states is still slapping duties on specific chinese products
aluminium foil has already been hit with swingeing countervailing duties and the net has just been widened to include aluminium alloy sheet
this is the dilemma for the rest the world
it now desperately needs chinese exports of primary metal to rebalance the market but simultaneously still needs lower exports of products
china s own aluminium production sector meanwhile is experiencing plenty of its own turbulence
the closure last year of illegal capacity meaning that operating without all the correct permits and mandated curtailments at some plants during the winter smog campaign have slowed production growth to just percent in the first quarter of
it s true that the winter heating season cuts have disappointed aluminium bulls
but the environmental pressure on the aluminium smelting sector shows no signs of letting up any time soon
adding new uncertainty is a draft proposal from the national development and reform commission targeting aluminium producers drawing their power from captive coal plants and stipulating retroactive power payments to the government
hongqiao the world s largest aluminium producer and one that is heavily reliant on coal could be particularly vulnerable
at this stage the proposal is no more than that and there is likely plenty of for such a big industrial powerhouse and employer
but the key takeaway here is that beijing s scrutiny of its aluminium sector is only getting sharper as it targets both excessive capacity and polluting industries
at any other time in recent history china s giant smelter sector could have been relied upon to lift production in response to rocketing prices
right now however price is only part of a more complex landscape defined by illegal capacity closures winter curtailments and now the viability of coal as a source of the power needed to produce the metal
the global aluminium industry continues to pay the price of chinese excess
with over half of the world s aluminium production concentrated in one country there is no cushion outside of china to compensate for diminished flows of metal from rusal
moreover what is clearly available right now in china namely the million tonnes sitting in shanghai warehouses is trapped behind china s export tax
what is flowing in ever increasing quantities out of china is in the wrong form for the rest of the world which now needs more primary aluminium and less product
this problematic reliance on china has been growing for many years but it s taken the hit on the largest producer to expose the dysfunctional nature of the global aluminium supply chain
