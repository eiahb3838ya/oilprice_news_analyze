update 1-exclusive-viability of french-spain gas pipeline questioned - report
paris reuters a report prepared for the european commission has questioned the economic viability of plans to build a huge gas pipeline between spain and france designed to boost security of supply in europe five sources told reuters
the commission has long backed the billion euro billion midcat pipeline that would more than double the amount of gas that can be piped across the pyrenees mountains that border the two nations
french gas grid terega owned by italy s snam and spain s enagas want to invest in the project which has strong support from european union climate commissioner miguel arias canete a spanish national
but the project has faced opposition from french energy regulator cre who says midcat would push up consumer prices without improving security
french gas network firm grtgaz also questions the need for the pipeline
now a study by poyry a consultancy appointed to assess the first phase of midcat for the commission indicates the project is unlikely to be economically viable
it said it would only achieve financially viability in scenarios with a tight lng market
the study says the step pipeline across the pyrenees the first and central part of the broader midcat project would only be viable if lng prices over a long period remained significantly higher than pipeline gas prices
specialists say that is unlikely
the report seen by reuters will be the basis for a commission discussion on wednesday of priority eu infrastructure plans termed projects of common interest pci
the commission has declined requests to release the report citing commercial confidentiality and did not respond to a request for comment
poyry declined to comment
terega infrastructure director michel boche said the step pipeline would cost million euros of which million for terega and million for enagas
the firms have sent an investment proposal to the cre
in october they will present the case to the european union which could provide subsidies of up to percent
regulated network operators typically earn around a percent return on their asset base on such projects
boche said the expected flow would be mainly from france to spain but the interconnector would be reversible in case of need
last winter gas flowed from spain to france only about two days to boost britain s gas supplies during a cold spell
many experts question the need for another interconnector saying that existing pipelines are already underutilised even during periods of high demand
if there were a real demand for midcat the market would already have built those interconnectors said one of the sources familiar with the poyry report
the project has attracted critics
the midcat project is not coherent with the eu s climate commitments and its promises to reduce reliance on fossil energy said michele rivasi a french member of the european parliament
friends of the earth europe s antoine simon said step was designed as a precursor to a bigger billion euro investment in the midcat pipeline across france and the iberian peninsula
step is a reasonable project that responds to the desire of the heads of state of france spain and portugal to strengthen our gas interconnections and boost security of supply in europe terega s boche said
spanish european mp xabier benito ziluaga said midcat made no economic sense and that madrid backed the plan to support its gas industry
it is a project based on private interests not on public interest or objective evidence he said
