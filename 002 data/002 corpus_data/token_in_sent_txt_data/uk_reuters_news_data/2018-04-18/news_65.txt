britain's costa promises to recycle half a billion coffee cups by 2020
london reuters britain s costa coffee pledged on wednesday to recycling half a billion coffee cups a year by and said it seeks to become the first chain to guarantee it recycles the same number of cups as it puts onto the market
less than percent of coffee cups are recycled in britain which has led to politicians calling for a latte levy on disposable cups
britain has resisted those calls and instead encourages voluntary measures to limit cup use
costa said there was a misconception that coffee cups could not be recycled and that while the process was more costly it had reached agreements with five waste disposal firms to guarantee more cups would be recycled
we think it s a really neat solution because it is effective immediately dominic paul managing director of costa coffee told reuters
it s not directly because of the conversations about the tax
it s something we ve been working on for quite a veolia biffa suez grundon and first mile are working with costa on the scheme which will start in offices transport hubs and other locations
costa said it would pay waste management companies pounds per tonne of cups collected
combined with the pounds per tonne they currently receive it makes it economically viable for the firms to collect the cups
an additional five pounds per tonne will go to an auditor
costa which is owned by whitbread said the costs of the programme would not be material
for the target of million cups for the next months the estimated cost is just under pounds
the goal is for million cups to be recycled by
the chain competes with companies like starbucks pret a manger caffee nero and greggs on the british high street and paul said that other firms should join the scheme
we think our competitors should join us on this it s the quickest way to get a material number of cups recycled he said
if none of our competitors joined us on this we would still do it ultimately that is going to be their reporting by alistair smout editing by stephen addison
