lucky for some: chinese city launches wind power lottery to ease grid strains
shanghai reuters the city of yanan a major wind power base in northwest china s shaanxi province has introduced a lottery system to decide which wind projects will go ahead this year a sign that grid constraints are forcing local governments to restrict capacity
china has been aggressively developing alternative power as part of its efforts to cut pollution and greenhouse gas emissions
wind power reached gigawatts gw last year up percent on the year and amounting to percent of total generating capacity
but capacity expansion has outpaced grid construction and large numbers of wind solar and hydropower plants are unable to deliver all their power to consumers as a result of transmission deficiencies a problem known as curtailment
according to a yanan planning agency notice seen by reuters the city was given permission to build megawatts of wind capacity this year but megawatts or gw have already been declared eligible for construction forcing authorities to whittle down the total number of projects
after study it was decided that the lottery method should be used to determine what plans will be submitted for approval to the provincial development and reform commission it said
the authenticity of the document was confirmed by a local municipal government official
he declined to give his name or provide details
china aims to raise the share of fuels in its total energy mix to around percent by the end of the decade up from percent in
but while renewable power has grown rapidly around gw of wind capacity was still unable to transmit electricity to consumers in
wasted wind power amounted to around percent of total generation in according to the energy regulator
an environmental group is currently suing grid companies in the northwest for failing to fulfill their legal obligation to maximize purchases of local renewable power
to try to prevent waste china has drawn up guidelines aimed at preventing new plant construction in regions already suffering from surplus capacity
it also released draft guidelines last month for a new renewable energy certificate system that will force regions to meet mandatory clean electricity utilization targets
the scheme is expected to help alleviate curtailment
