update 3-sunpower buys u.s. rival solarworld to head off trump tariffs
reuters sunpower corp on wednesday said it would buy solar panel maker solarworld americas expanding its domestic manufacturing as it seeks to stem the impact of trump administration tariffs on panel imports
the white house cheered the deal saying it was proof that trump s trade policies were stimulating investment
terms of the transaction were not disclosed
the news sent sunpower s shares up percent on the nasdaq to their highest level since before president donald trump imposed percent tariffs on imported solar panels in january
the time is right for sunpower to invest in manufacturing chief executive tom werner said in a statement
sunpower is based in san jose california but most of its manufacturing is in the philippines and mexico
the company had lobbied heavily against the solar trade case brought last year by manufacturers including solarworld which said they could not compete with a flood of cheap imports
the deal is a win for the trump administration s efforts to revive solar manufacturing through the tariffs
sunpower will manufacture its cheaper panels which more directly compete with chinese products at the solarworld factory in hillsboro oregon it said
it will also make solarworld s legacy products
this is great news for the hundreds of americans working at solarworld s factory in oregon and is further proof that the president s trade policies are bringing investment back to the united states white house deputy press secretary lindsay walters said in an emailed statement
the announcement comes as sunpower is seeking an exemption from tariffs on its more efficient panels manufactured overseas
it has argued to the trade representative which will make a decision on exemptions in the coming weeks that those products should be excluded because there is no competitor that makes a similar product
in a note to clients baird analyst ben kallo said the solarworld deal would enable the company to compete against chinese imports should sunpower s products not receive an exemption
but he added that skeptics may question the company s ability to generate profits with the deal will inject capital into solarworld s manufacturing plant and give it the support of a major market player
sunpower is one of the largest solar companies in the world and is majority owned by france s oil giant total sa
the arm of germany s solarworld ag opened the hillsboro factory in as it sought to capitalize on surging solar demand in the united states
but its start coincided with a dramatic increase in the production of cheaper solar products in asia and solarworld struggled to compete
twice in and trade cases brought by solarworld prompted the commerce department to slap import duties on solar products from china and taiwan
yet prices on solar panels continued their free fall and just three years later in the company joined rival suniva in asking for new tariffs
solarworld called the outcome ideal for its hundreds of employees in hillsboro
during the trade case and after the tariffs were announced the solar industry s trade group the solar energy industries association argued that the tariffs would not be enough to keep solarworld and suniva afloat
indeed suniva s future remains uncertain after a bankruptcy court judge this week granted a request by its biggest creditor that will allow it to sell a portion of the company s solar manufacturing equipment through a public auction
sunpower shares were up cents or percent at in trade on the nasdaq
the stock hit a high of earlier in the session its highest since late
