corrected-update 2-cnooc sells lng in debut shanghai auction as china aims to boost supplies
correct to read november delivery paragraph cnooc likely to auction more lng next month exchange official volume small but shanghai exchange aims to build liquidity shanghai market launched in beijing april reuters china national offshore oil corp cnooc on wednesday sold cargoes of liquefied natural gas lng on a domestic exchange for the first time the latest step by china to boost supplies of the clean fuel as the nation shifts away from coal
cnooc sold tonnes of lng for delivery in july and another tonnes for november delivery through an auction on the shanghai petroleum and gas exchange an official at the exchange said
eighteen bidders took part with the total volume sold within minutes a cnooc official involved in the auction said
interest in the auction was very strong he said
he declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media
he would not disclose the identity of the interested parties
though the volume is tiny compared to the nearly million tonnes of natural gas china imported last year the auction could help chinese industrial buyers avoid the shortages that occurred this past winter
ahead of the winter china moved millions of residential customers from coal heating to gas heating as part of its fight against air pollution
supplies however were not enough to meet the new demand and industrial users were interrupted to make residential supply available
buying forward supplies through auctions like the shanghai exchange s would give factories a chance to lock in prices and gas ahead of the winter heating season
more auctions would also help build liquidity on the shanghai exchange
cnooc is likely to hold another auction next month the exchange official said
china is the world s consumer of natural gas
the exchange official would not disclose the cargo prices but said they were relatively low compared with market expectations
shanghai launched its electronic platform in to create a pricing benchmark for china s burgeoning gas market
it faces potential competition from a rival in chongqing
trading volumes on the shanghai exchange were thin during its first two year but picked up last year ahead of the gas crunch this past winter
