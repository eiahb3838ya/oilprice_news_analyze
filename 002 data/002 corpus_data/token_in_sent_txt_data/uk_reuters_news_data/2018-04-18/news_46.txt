in sweden, wind farms and warplanes battle for airspace
oslo reuters several wind farm projects in sweden are under threat due to the government s decision to reserve more airspace for its armed forces according to two companies and an industry lobby group
in november the government said its air force had labelled more airspace as zones in order to protect its operations from the expanding wind power industry
the move to avoid planes colliding with wind turbines has created uncertainty for a number of planned wind farms
sweden s largest utility vattenfall said the decision affected at least four of its projects which together could generate around gigawatt gw of power
such projects would lose the permits and couldn t be built spokesman peter stedt said referring to two of the projects that have been approved
in all some gw of planned wind power production could be cancelled according to industry lobby svensk vindenergi equivalent to percent of sweden s current wind production
around gw of that relates to wind farms with permits and gw to projects awaiting approval it said
eolus vind which builds wind farms and has projects under consideration in the affected areas said it needed more clarity from authorities
clarification is important so that developers do not spend money on projects that have a low chance of being permitted due to the views of the armed forces said spokesman johan hammarqvist
the government said projects that have been approved should not be affected
plants that already have permits to build should normally not be affected by the new areas energy minister ibrahim baylan told reuters
sweden aims to meet its energy needs without producing global warming carbon dioxide by and defence interests should be balanced with energy targets he added
but svensk vindenergi said several companies with approved farms will have to reapply for permits because they need to build turbines that are higher than originally planned and are therefore at risk of being refused
many of the permitted parks have a maximum height of metres
in general at least metres is needed to reach the wind needed to be able to realise the project with today s low price on electricity and certificates said hallberg
some projects could still be considered in the newly designated areas the armed forces said
in some cases the thorough analysis that is always performed might conclude that a wind power project can coexist in some specific areas its press office told reuters
according to svensk vindenergi the government s decision affects percent of sweden s territory up from percent previously
the energy ministry and the armed forces did not provide their own calculations of the area affected with the military saying the information was classified
