russian energy ministry - tax change could boost oil output
moscow april reuters the russian energy ministry has proposed changes to a draft oil production law that it says could boost production by around tonnes per year first deputy energy minister alexei texler said on wednesday
debate about the law has dragged on for years as the finance ministry expressed concerns the changes could reduce state revenues
oilfields especially in west siberia have become increasingly depleted and the new tax regime is seen as an incentive to produce more oil in a country which is heavily dependent on sales of energy for state revenue
russia s parliament has approved the new tax on the oil industry on a first reading
currently taxes are based on production via a mineral extraction tax and exports
the new tax will initially cover four groups of oilfields including new deposits in regions of east siberia fields which enjoy a lower export duty and some fields in west siberia
the new taxes at least on an initial stage will be applicable to only limited number of fields depending on how big their reserves are
texler said the ministry had proposed increasing quotas for the groups of oilfields eligible for the new tax from million tonnes of reserves to million tonnes and the changes would be debated in the second crucial reading
in addition the new proposal would raise the limits for a single oilfield to which the new taxation could be applicable to million tonnes of reserves from million tonnes to increase the scope for the taxation
the proposals would boost production of oil by tonnes per year bpd texler said
he didn t say to which level
the law is expected to be implemented starting from
a forecast published in september by the economy ministry saw russian oil production rising to million tonnes per year in
lawmakers must approve the draft in three readings before it is sent it to the upper house of parliament and then president vladimir putin for signature
