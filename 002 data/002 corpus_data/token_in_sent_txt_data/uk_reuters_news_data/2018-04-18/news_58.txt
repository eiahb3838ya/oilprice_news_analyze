australia to amend $3.9 bln infrastructure fund in bid to develop country's north
sydney reuters australia will amend the guidelines for a a billion billion fund that offers loans to build infrastructure in the country s north so it can offer greater support to a broader range of projects a government minister said on wednesday
the changes will aid a bid to develop australia s sparsely populated yet northern region opening the fund to more projects after some such as a proposed coal mine by indian conglomerate adani enterprises ran into political hurdles
the northern australia infrastructure facility naif was introduced in but its rules had proved too restrictive said minister for northern australia matt canavan
there s a strong pipeline of projects but it has been challenging to get them to financial close so that s why some of these rules are being changed canavan told australian broadcasting corporation radio
the government will remove a requirement that means naif can fund only percent of a project while the types of infrastructure that can be backed will also be broadened
the changes now make it absolutely clear that we are able to consider smaller projects where they meet our mandatory criteria naif chief executive laurie walker said in a statement
canavan said naif had projects in the pipeline relating to energy generation and gas pipelines transport tourism agriculture manufacturing water infrastructure and communications i am confident that many of the projects currently under consideration by the board of naif will quickly be given the tick of approval once these changes are made he told abc radio
the changes will not however revive adani s giant coal mine which has faced strong opposition on environmental grounds australia s treasurer scott morrison said
it s off the table
they made that decision
this change in no way resuscitates that morrison told reporters in sydney
adani had hoped for government funding to help build a km mile rail line connecting its proposed mine with a pacific ocean port
australian state leaders will also keep their ability to veto any naif loan which scuttled adani s plans morrison said
the amendments come just over months out from australia s next federal election where the ruling coalition government will seek to win favor with voters on its economic record
australia s north which has been home to a rise of parties such as pauline hanson s one nation is shaping up as a key battleground and contains many of the ruling coalition government s least secure seats
