though the volume is tiny compared to the nearly million tonnes of natural gas china imported last year the auction could help chinese industrial buyers avoid the shortages that occurred this past winter
ahead of the winter china moved millions of residential customers from coal heating to gas heating as part of its fight against air pollution
supplies however were not enough to meet the new demand and industrial users were interrupted to make residential supply available
buying forward supplies through auctions like the shanghai exchange s would give factories a chance to lock in prices and gas ahead of the winter heating season
more auctions would also help build liquidity on the shanghai exchange
cnooc is likely to hold another auction next month the exchange official said
china is the world s consumer of natural gas
the exchange official would not disclose the cargo prices but said they were relatively low compared with market expectations

it faces potential competition from a rival in chongqing
trading volumes on the shanghai exchange were thin during its first two year but picked up last year ahead of the gas crunch this past winter
