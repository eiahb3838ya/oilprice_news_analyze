libya eyes fuel marking, boat seizures, to counter fuel smuggling
tunis reuters libya s national oil corporation noc is considering using a chemical marking system to help trace oil products smuggled out of the country its chairman said on wednesday
mustafa sanalla also called on a european union naval mission to combat smugglers by seizing their ships in the mediterranean said the united nations should consider sanctioning smugglers and urged libya to reform massive subsidies that allow fuel to be sold for as little as cents per litre
the fuel smugglers and thieves have permeated not only the militias which control much of libya but also the fuel distribution companies which are supposed to bring cheap fuel to libyan citizens sanalla told an inaugural oil and fuel theft conference in geneva
the huge sums of money available from smuggling have corrupted large parts of libyan society he said according to a text of his speech
the noc was looking at adding molecular markers to subsidised fuel to help libyan and international law enforcers including europol cepol and interpol identify smugglers sanalla said
fuels can be tracked by using chemical markers that bind to fuel molecules
smuggling networks have flourished amid the political turmoil and armed conflict that developed following libya s uprising
groups are often involved in multiple types of smuggling making huge profits from illicit sales of fuel and the transfer of migrants towards europe
between and percent of fuel refined in libya or imported into the country is stolen or smuggled according to the noc
libyan vessels smuggle mainly diesel to international ships offshore while gasoline is diverted to roadside sellers or smugglers who operate across libya s land borders
the practice costs the libyan state one billion libyan dinars per year or million at the official exchange rate the noc estimates
action taken so far including italian prosecution and sanctions against smuggling networks and a ditch and berm built by tunisia on its border with libya had not been enough to create a major disincentive for the fuel smugglers sanalla said
though local officials say they are trying to crack down on fuel smuggling fuel is still allocated to inoperational or ghost petrol stations
prices are among the lowest in the world though rampant smuggling means petrol shortages are common and libyans often pay a higher black market price
fuel smugglers are and
and every day their grip on regions of libya and also on neighbouring countries who receive smuggled and stolen libyan fuel becomes stronger and more institutionalised sanalla said
he called for the mandate of the eu s naval mission operation sophia to be extended to combat the smuggling of refined fuel as well as oil saying that much of the illegal activity could be traced by radar or satellite and was concentrated at hurd s bank anchorage just outside maltese territorial waters
