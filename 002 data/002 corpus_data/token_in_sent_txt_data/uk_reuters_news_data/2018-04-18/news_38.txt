out of bankruptcy, seadrill eyes closer ties with oil service firms
oslo april reuters offshore oil driller seadrill aims to expand relations with schlumberger the world s largest oil services firm and other suppliers to the global oil and gas industry its chief executive told reuters on wednesday
seadrill plans to emerge from chapter bankruptcy proceedings in late june or early july following a court s approval on tuesday of its dollar debt restructuring plan ceo anton dibowitz said
the confirmation is the most significant milestone in the process and now we need to implement the plan over days
obviously we would like to do it as fast as possible he added
seadrill is already cooperating with schlumberger in india to offer integrated services and may expand this to other locations and partners although the company has no immediate consolidation plans
equally we are in discussions with all major oil service companies and if there are opportunities that makes sense for both of us we will certainly entertain that dibowitz said
