update 1-egypt to run ports 24 hours to cut costly delays
adds quote context cairo april reuters egypt will keep ports running for hours a day up from currently to cut long waiting times for shipments transportation minister hesham arafat said on wednesday as the country tackles an issue that has cost it millions of dollars
grain traders over the last year have added hefty premiums on shipments headed to egypt the world s largest wheat buyer partly as a result of soaring demurrage fees costs borne by suppliers if they fail to unload their ships on time
traders say the high demurrage fees have resulted from congestion at egypt s ports and what they describe as a tedious inspection process stalling their vessels prompting them to add risk premiums of up to on individual cargoes
egypt s state grain buyer gasc set new tender terms in february to cap demurrage fees after major suppliers shunned state wheat tenders
arafat said the extended port hours would come at no added cost to shippers
he did not specify when the new hours would take effect or how long the new policy would remain in place
traders said under the current system shippers could pay for additional time at the port beyond the regular hours
one trader called the new hours a good move to avoid extra costs but said much of the current problem was also tied to a lack of storage space at egypt s crowded ports something the new policy would not correct
some of the storage areas inside the port don t have enough space to discharge the whole quantities he said
