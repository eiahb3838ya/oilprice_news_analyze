rpt-exclusive-study for eu questions jumbo france-spain gas pipe plan - sources
repeats with no changes to text midcat seen key for independence from russia gas exports experts say existing infrastructure underused teregas enagas want to invest in pipeline plan french regulator questions need for project by geert de clercq paris april reuters a report prepared for the european commission has questioned the economic viability of plans to build a gas pipeline connecting spain and france designed in part to help reduce europe s reliance on russian piped gas five sources told reuters
the commission has long backed the billion euro billion midcat pipeline that would more than double the amount of gas that can be piped across the pyrenees mountains that border the two nations
french pipeline operator terega owned by italy s snam and spain s enagas want to invest in the project which they say would give europe greater access to spain s numerous liquefied natural gas lng terminals
midcat is also supported by european union climate commissioner miguel arias canete a spanish national
but the project has faced opposition from french energy regulator cre who says midcat would push up consumer prices without improving security
french gas network firm grtgaz has also questioned the need for the pipeline
now a study by poyry a consultancy appointed to assess the first phase of midcat for the commission indicates the project is unlikely to be economically viable
it said it would only achieve financially viability in scenarios with a tight lng market
it said such tightness in the gas market could be caused by a sharp fall in algerian gas supplies to europe a scenario that sources said was unlikely
experts said existing gas infrastructure across the pyrenees is already underutilised even during periods of high demand
if there were a real demand for midcat the market would already have built those interconnectors said one of the sources familiar with the poyry report
the report which has not been published by the commission but which was seen by reuters will be the basis for a commission discussion on wednesday of priority eu infrastructure plans termed projects of common interest pci
the commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment
poyry declined to comment
a spokeswoman for terega said the project is in line with european objectives to reinforce flexibility and the project has attracted criticism from politicians and environmental activists
by pouring billions of public money into new fossil gas infrastructure europe would wave goodbye to the paris agreement friends of the earth europe s antoine simon said
spanish european parliament member xabier benito ziluaga said madrid backed the plan to support its gas industry
his french colleague michele rivasi who also opposes the plans told reuters the midcat project is not coherent with the european union s climate commitments and its promises to reduce reliance on fossil euros additional reporting by alissa de carbonel writing by geert de clercq editing by edmund blair
