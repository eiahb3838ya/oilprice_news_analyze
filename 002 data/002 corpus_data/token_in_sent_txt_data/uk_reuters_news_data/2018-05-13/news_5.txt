update 2-trump administration axes project to generate power from plutonium
washington reuters the trump administration plans to kill a project it says would have cost tens of billions of dollars to convert plutonium from cold nuclear bombs and burn it to generate electricity according to a document it sent to congress last week
the department of energy submitted a document on may to senate and house of representative committees saying that the mixed oxide mox project at the savannah river site in south carolina would cost about billion more than billion already spent on it
the united states has never built a mox plant
instead of completing mox the administration like the obama administration before it wants to blend the tonnes of deadly plutonium enough to make about nuclear weapons with an inert substance and bury it underground in a new mexico s waste isolation pilot plant wipp
burying the plutonium would cost about billion according to the document a copy of which was seen by reuters
we are currently processing plutonium in south carolina for shipment to wipp and intend to continue to do so energy secretary rick perry said in a letter sent to committee leaders
legislation passed in february allows the energy department to advance burying the plutonium if it showed that the cost would be less than half of completing mox
south carolina politicians including senator lindsey graham have defended the mox plant saying it is about percent complete would help keep plutonium out of the hands of militants and provide up to direct jobs
south carolina s governor henry mcmaster complained to perry in a letter earlier this month that the energy department s dilution plan is at best south carolina which has already sued the department over the mox plant will use all legal recourses available to continue the program mcmaster said
the energy department has deemed the savannah site could be used to manufacture new plutonium pits or triggers for nuclear weapons an idea mcmaster said was an attempt to pacify south carolina but would not provide jobs for many years
the energy department document estimated that diluting the plutonium would require jobs at savannah river through the late
edwin lyman a physicist at science advisory group the union of concerned scientists concerned about plutonium getting into the wrong hands said perry had made a sensible decision
