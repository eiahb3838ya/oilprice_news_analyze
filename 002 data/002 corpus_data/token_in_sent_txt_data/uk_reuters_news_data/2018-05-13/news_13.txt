uae extends military reach in yemen and somalia
repeats story from friday uae wins friends plants bases in yemen and east africa abu dhabi seeks to counter islamism and iran guard trade south yemen secessionist officers rise up with uae blessings presidents of breakaway somali regions embrace trainers by noah browning and alexander cornwell abu dhabi may reuters military transport planes from the united arab emirates landed on the sleepy yemeni island of socotra last week unloading tanks and troops as part of the gulf arab state s drive to extend its influence over a strategic waterway flanked by war zones
the uae with a population of less than million but the arab world s economy thanks to oil is deploying its soldiers and cash to create a web of bases and armed allies in yemen and somalia as a bulwark against islamist extremists and iranian influence according to diplomats as well as yemeni and somali officials
but backing groups at loggerheads with their national governments threatens to bog down the uae in the seemingly endless conflicts of two of the world s poorest countries
lying between the arabian peninsula and horn of africa socotra island best known for its otherworldly plant life appeared far from the war until the uae troops arrived in a landing reported by yemeni officials and media
the yemeni government accused the uae of seizing the island s ports and airport
a government source told reuters that the uae move was a for commercial and security interests and accused the uae of trying to colonise yemen
they won t get that from yemen the source said
yes yemenis are poor but they fight for their sovereignty the uae foreign ministry in a statement on socotra said it backed yemen s legitimate government and sought to establish peace and stability and to support developmental projects for the island s residents
the uae has built up local army units in yemen increasing its influence along the red sea coast but also opening up a rift with the country s exiled government
across the bab strait through which much of the world s oil flows the uae also has a foothold in northern somalia where emirati firms have set up commercial ports and its troops conduct military and training missions
abu dhabi political capital of the federation is moving assertively against the threat it sees from islamist groups such as al qaeda while promoting itself as a stable open and largely tolerant muslim country
it has allied itself with saudi arabia in the war against the houthi group in yemen and with three arab powers in a boycott of qatar accusing it of backing terriorism
the uae has hired senior foreign military officers to modernize its army including australia s former top special forces general mike hindmarsh who reports to abu dhabi s powerful crown prince sheikh mohammed bin zayed
hindmarsh oversees the presidential guard the unit tasked with directing the uae s campaign in yemen
they are taking the fight to the enemy around the region said a western diplomat
a gulf source spelled out the uae approach saying it was protecting its interests in the region and promoting development to deter recruitment by islamist groups
the uae is helping to develop economically viable zones that create jobs and improve standards of living while also providing humanitarian and financial there is a comprehensive emirati approach to fostering stability in the region the source said
a monument of leaning pillars in abu dhabi shows the cost of this engagement inscribed with soldiers names the memorial pays tribute to the uae s martyrs
the vast majority more than fell in the war the uae is fighting in yemen alongside saudi arabia against the houthis
saudi arabia s main ally in the conflict yemen s heavily islamist government is struggling against the houthis who control the north of the country and the capital sanaa
the uae which has made the only visible gains by the coalition along the southwestern coast has adopted a different strategy and cultivated its own friends in the war
across a string of small bases from the volcanic island of perim at the mouth of the red sea to the dunes of rumah near the omani border the uae pays salaries and trains troops
at the beginning of the yemen war the uae prised from iran s orbit a struggling secessionist movement which hopes to revive the former state of south yemen
the socialist movement s leaders left yemen after the north and south were unified in and wound up in hezbollah s south beirut stronghold from where they ran a insurgency in yemen diplomatic and southern political sources said
iranian revolutionary guard officials and hezbollah schooled the southern commanders in guerrilla tactics in hopes of destabilising saudi arabia s southern flank the sources said
but when the houthis advanced into southern yemen in promises of assistance from the uae convinced the southern leadership to move to abu dhabi from where they could carry on the fight for their yemeni homeland
they want to fight iranian militias trying to seize our lands and we do too
this is enough for the alliance to make sense for now one southern official told reuters
this alliance helped the uae to seize the southern port of aden in
the uae trained southern yemeni forces who captured the other main port mukalla from al qaeda
mukalla airport closed to commercial flights now hosts emirati helicopters a training centre detention facility and also a small contingent of special forces helping to fight al qaeda in nearby mountains
iran s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any involvement with the southern yemeni secessionists
hezbollah also declined to comment
somalia raids by somali pirates on trade routes along the horn of africa helped draw the uae home to the middle east s busiest port into the tangled politics of somalia which has grappled for over a decade with al shabaab militants
the uae is deepening ties with the regions of somaliland and puntland after emirati firms dp world and p o ports signed deals there in and
uae troops quickly followed and have begun building a military base in berbera somaliland the region s president muse bihi abdi told reuters while on a visit to abu dhabi
it will be the guarantee for our security for our development in any case of terrorism
they have the resources and knowledge better than us
we are a nation after a war rebuilding he said
the relationship which includes investing hundreds of millions of dollars in somaliland for projects such as a highway to ethiopia and new airport has angered the central government in somalia and the uae has ended its military training mission in mogadishu
uae minister of state for foreign affairs anwar gargash told reuters that support for the regions was not intended to split somalia and his country had no quarrel with the central government
our policy of recognising a stands
but at the same time we are able to support the people of somaliland through humanitarian the president of puntland abdiweli mohamed ali told reuters in dubai that uae personnel were training local forces to combat piracy as well as islamist groups in yemen or somalia
he denied that the uae sought a colonial presence
they are not occupying as a military force in somalia he said
it s impossible
we are fierce fighters we will never allow that to additional reporting by aziz el yaakoubi writing by noah browning editing by ghaida ghantous and giles elgood
