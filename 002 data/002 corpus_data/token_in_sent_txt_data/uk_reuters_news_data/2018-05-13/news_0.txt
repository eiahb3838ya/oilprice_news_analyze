reuters oil major conocophillips has seized products belonging to venezuelan state oil company pdvsa from the isla refinery it runs on curacao an island official told reuters on sunday
conoco has won court orders allowing it to seize pdvsa assets on caribbean islands including curacao in efforts to collect on a billion arbitral award linked to the nationalization of conoco assets under late leader hugo chavez
pdvsa products from the installations of the isla refinery have been confiscated
we don t have any way to get them said steven martina curacao s minister for economic development who did not provide the amount or value of the seized products
conoco and pdvsa did not immediately respond to requests for comment
martina added that curacao was planning to meet with pdvsa and conoco this week to discuss the dispute that has led conoco to seize venezuelan assets in the caribbean wreaking havoc on pdvsa s export chain
the dispute has also caused worry on curacao a constituent country within the kingdom of the netherlands with a vibrant tourism industry and ports used by the oil industry
the island is heavily dependent on the refinery which provides as much as percent of curacao s gross domestic product and is a big source of employment on the island just off venezuela
there is no need to be alarmed fuel and services are guaranteed curacao s prime minister eugene rhuggenaath said in a news conference on sunday
he added that lawyers are also contacting conoco to reach a deal and pdvsa is preparing to shut a caribbean refinery that is running out of crude amid threats by conoco to seize cargoes sent to resupply the facility two sources with knowledge of the situation told reuters on friday
but martina said the isla refinery was still operating albeit at low levels thanks to curacao s reserves
