germany plans to change laws governing russian gas pipeline - minister
munich feb reuters germany is considering changes to the legal framework governing the nord stream gas pipeline to make sure that it complies with new european union regulations economy minister peter altmaier told reuters on friday
my assumption is that it can be built under the new conditions he said
but there will clearly be some changes
one regarding the ownership of the pipeline since european law requires ownership of pipeline and production to be separated
there may also be changes regarding who has access to the pipeline and who can feed it he said but added that it was for germany to decide which changes it would make and how
