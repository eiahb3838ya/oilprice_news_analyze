now
orla de wardener said she had been inspired by the example of greta thunberg a student whose regular friday protests outside sweden s parliament have led to a spreading international school strike movement
after reading about thunberg in a children s science magazine i was totally enthralled with her
she s amazing said de wardener a student at weston park primary school near finsbury park in north london
adults she said do not act on climate change because they re involved with their money and their work
they don t care said de wardener who sported a polar bear hat and a sign reading your failure our future
politicians she said have had their life
they don t see much point in fighting for the future
her classmate iris adderley said she was worried about the quickening pace of extinctions in nature and the risks of sea level rise including flooding in britain
adults just don t think about it enough she said
nora mackay a student at graveney school in tooting south london said her school s administration had discouraged students from attending the protest but everyone is here anyway she said
my parents said go on the march
the future of the world is more important than one day of school she said standing with dozens of classmates in the square
christiana figueres who was climate chief when the paris agreement on climate change was agreed said she hoped politicians would heed the deeply moving voice of youth and schoolchildren who are so worried about their future
that children feel they need to strike to draw attention to the problem is a sign we are failing in our responsibility to protect them from the worsening impacts of climate change she said
john sauven the executive director of greenpeace uk said students were taking action because young people know their lives are going to be changed dramatically by the impacts of climate change
the risks that older people hope they might dodge are the problems the young will inherit he warned in a press release
while we re failing to deliver the changes young people need we can hardly blame them for taking action global temperatures are on course for a rise of degrees to degrees celsius degrees to degrees fahrenheit this century far overshooting a global target of limiting the increase to or less the world meteorological organization says
that is bringing growing risks from extreme weather including worsening droughts floods fires and storms as well as threats of worsening hunger poverty and water shortages scientists say
limiting those risks will require rapid and unprecedented changes to the world s energy systems and to human behavior scientists said in an intergovernmental panel on climate change report released last october
friday s protests are just the latest in an international string of youth strikes and efforts to sue governments to protect future generations many of them led by people too young to vote
organisers of the british protests said their demands included more information about the ecological crisis in the national curriculum declaration of a national climate emergency and a lowering of the national voting age to
many of the students at the parliament square protests said they were taking action in their own lives to cut emissions from eating less meat to cutting out airline flights and walking or biking more
others said they and many of their classmates were choosing to write speeches and essays on climate change as part of their schoolwork and that they saw the issue becoming a hot topic on social media
many of friday s protests were organised via social media with participants saying they had read up on climate change there
zakiyya who attends clapton girls academy in hackney in east london and asked that her surname not be used said she became a vegan last year after learning how much meat and dairy production drove emissions
this is our lives our future
if we want to live we need to make changes now she said carrying a sign pleading we are scared
listen to us bruno olliffe of norwich in the east of england said he and his family had taken up recycling but he thought the most powerful way to bring change was to convince parliamentarians of the need one reason he d traveled to london with his mother
right now they re too stuffed up with brexit said the
when it comes to climate change they don t realise how bad it is
but we speeches by thunberg and naturalist david attenborough had made it clear he said that the impacts will hit the whole world every corner
it s my future and i don t want it to be ruined he said
