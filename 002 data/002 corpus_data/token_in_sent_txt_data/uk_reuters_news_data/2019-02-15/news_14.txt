update 1-anadarko closes in on final mozambique lng decision
indian agreement cements over mtpa in committed offtake anadarko says another deal expected in very near future project will turn mozambique into major gas exporter adds anadarko comment on other agreements ptt by sabina zawadzki london feb reuters independent energy producer anadarko moved closer to a final investment decision fid to build a giant liquefied natural gas lng terminal in mozambique after signing up an indian buyer for the gas and saying another deal was imminent
anadarko and exxon mobil are expected to sanction two separate but neighbouring lng projects in mozambique this year after finding large offshore gas deposits turning the african nation into a major global gas exporter
the company said on friday it had struck a sales and purchase agreement spa with india s bharat petroleum corporation ltd for million tonnes per annum mtpa for years the fourth such agreement this month
this brings the total commitments anadarko has for the project to mtpa out of a capacity of mtpa a level it has previously said would allow it to make the investment
we anticipate announcing another spa in the very near future helen rhymes an anadarko spokeswoman said in emailed comments reiterating that the final decision would come in the first half of this year
other committed buyers according to anadarko are tokyo gas and britain s centrica in a joint deal royal dutch shell chinese state energy firm cnooc tohuku electric and french utility edf
anadarko hinted at further supply agreements late on thursday when it issued its annual report and said execution of spas representing mtpa of additional contracted volume is anticipated prior to fid
anadarko had penned an supply agreement with pttep the exploration and production arm of thailand s state energy firm ptt which also holds a percent stake in the project
rhymes said that deal still needed approval from thai authorities
anadarko and its area continue to work with ptt toward the conclusion of the spa
however we are not reliant on completing this agreement to take fid in the first half of this year she said
indian state energy firms bharat ongc and oil india hold a percent equity stake in the project either directly or through subsidiary joint ventures but this is the first offtake agreement with an indian buyer
india is the world s fourth largest lng importer after japan china and south korea a position it is expected to consolidate in years to come with growing imports
