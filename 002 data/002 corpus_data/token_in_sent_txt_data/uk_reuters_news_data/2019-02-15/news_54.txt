exclusive-big firms weigh in as france looks to revive offshore wind
paris reuters a french wind power tender has attracted interest from a slew of international energy heavyweights signalling that france s offshore wind industry could finally be taking off after years of missteps
while britain and germany have already built and megawatts mw of offshore wind capacity enough to power millions of homes france does not have a single turbine in the water
in two previous french tenders in and a bumper mw of capacity worth billion euros billion pounds was awarded but the projects have not materialised because of public opposition and contract wrangles
now france is making a new start auctioning a modest mw in the northern town of dunkirk in a tender it hopes will finally exploit some of the best offshore wind potential in europe
so far investors appear to like the prospects
ten interested companies or consortia including some of europe s leading offshore wind developers have been shortlisted to submit bids by a march deadline although one has pulled out according to three industry sources
however despite the investor interest strong public opposition to wind farms in france that has constrained the development of the industry for years remains a major obstacle and could yet derail the planned schemes
the shortlist includes french power giants edf in partnership with germany s innogy and canada s enbridge and engie with portugal s edpr
among the foreign bidders are norwegian oil major equinor royal dutch shell with france s quadran and belgium s deme swedish utility vattenfall with french state bank cdc and german wind developer wpd and dutch utility eneco in a consortium including canada s boralex
this tender will set the tone for the future of offshore wind in france said tako keja director of moulins de flandre the consortium
those six parties have either made public their interest or confirmed to reuters that they would bid
belgian firm elicio consortium and owned incontrol will also take part in the tender according to the industry sources
dunkirk is close to belgium which already has mw offshore capacity
spain s iberdrola was also shortlisted but has since withdrawn but denmark s orsted europe s top offshore wind developer was in talks to join one of the consortia one source said
iberdrola and orsted declined to comment as did the french energy regulator cre which is running the tender
france has one of europe s biggest coastlines as well as good wind speeds with about square km of viable wind farm area on its atlantic coast alone european environment agency data shows
but with percent of its electricity produced by nuclear france has long been a laggard in renewable energy rollout and lacks big wind energy champions like denmark s vestas or firm siemens gamesa
when the previous socialist government finally gave for offshore wind it not only wanted to build turbines but thought it could use the tenders to kickstart an offshorewind export industry
the criteria of the and tenders favoured manufacturing of turbines and the winning bids awarded at prices way above market levels duly selected turbines made by french groups areva and alstom
but seven years later not a single one has been built in france as the projects have been blocked by public opposition authorities have cut planned subsidies for budget reasons and areva and alstom s wind units have both been bought by foreign firms siemens gamesa and ge respectively
trying to move on from the two first tenders problems french president emmanuel macron s draft energy plan announced last month targets relatively modest offshore wind capacity of mw by and about mw by
that is well below earlier targets and half what industry lobby group fee recommended but the government hopes that by creating a level playing field and focussing on price it will be third time lucky
the criteria of the new dunkirk tender which have not been made public do not require turbines according to two industry sources involved in the bids with the overriding emphasis placed on pricing
two sources close to the bids said financial criteria will have an percent weighting of which percent is purely about price and percent based on the robustness of the offers
in initial talks with prospective bidders the state had imposed a to euro per megawatt hour mwh range in an effort to balance a competitive price with the need to invite serious bidders
in the final version it dropped that requirement so consortia can bid as low as they want one source said
the percent robustness criteria evaluates to what extent the french state can be certain that what is proposed will effectively be executed on schedule and within budget
the remaining percent of the bid weighting is based on environmental and land use criteria which will force developers to optimise turbine size and placement so as to get maximum power production with minimal environmental impact
the cre regulator is set to recommend a winning bidder by mid april
if the government accepts the recommendation the tender could be awarded before summer if the yellow vest protest movement that has rocked the country in recent months does not perturb the process
with macron s reform plans shaken by the yellow vests he may be wary of announcing expensive renewable energy projects an official at one of the consortia said
