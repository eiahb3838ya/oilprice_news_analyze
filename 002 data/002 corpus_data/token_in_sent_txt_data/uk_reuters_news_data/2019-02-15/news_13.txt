u.s. to deliver over 200 tons of aid to venezuelan border
munich reuters military aircraft are expected to deliver more than tons of humanitarian aid to the venezuelan border in colombia with the shipment likely to take place on saturday a official said on friday
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the state department planned to make an announcement about the shipment on friday but provided no further details
the state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment
the special envoy on venezuela last week said the aid effort was being coordinated with the opposition team but said the aid would not be forced into venezuela
venezuelan president nicolas maduro has overseen an economic collapse in the south american country that has left millions struggling to buy food and medicines and has fueled an unprecedented migration crisis in the region
an aid convoy supplied by the united states and colombia arrived in the colombian border town of cucuta last week where it is being held in warehouses
maduro has refused to let supplies in
president juan guaido the opposition leader told a huge rally of supporters on tuesday that humanitarian aid would enter the country on
guaido invoked constitutional provisions to declare himself interim president last month arguing that maduro s was a sham
most western countries including the united states and many of venezuela s neighbours have recognised guaido as the legitimate head of state
maduro retains the backing of russia and china and control of venezuelan state institutions including the military
seeking to strengthen support for guaido the united states has said it will try to channel aid to venezuela via colombia and possibly brazil
maduro has called the aid a show and denies any crisis
however opposition member gustavo tarre has said the sole aim is to ease the suffering of venezuelans and has denied any political economic or military motive
