update 2-nigeria presidential election could be delayed in some areas -sources
nigeria reuters nigerian authorities postponed saturday s national election by a week just hours before polls had been due to open prompting the opposition candidate to accuse president muhammadu buhari of seeking to disenfranchise voters
the electoral commission said the postponement was due solely to logistical factors and denied political pressure had played any part in the decision
buhari and his rival former vice president atiku abubakar both urged voters to stay calm
mahmood yakubu chairman of the independent electoral commission said the election would now be held on adding that the date was sacrosanct and that campaigning would be suspended until then
buhari in power since faces a tight election contest against atiku of the people s democratic party pdp
nigeria is africa s largest economy and its top oil producer
nigerians expressed dismay and anger over the delay in a country where million people have registered to vote
past elections have been marred by violence intimidation and and the postponement raised the possibility of unrest
they the government are not following the rule of law
this is a total ploy it is not true that they are not ready said opposition supporter oscar humphrey in the northern city of kano a key battlefield in the presidential race
in president buhari s hometown of daura in northern nigeria student dauru balarabi also expressed dismay saying he had gone there specially to vote
i spent my morning my time my energy for the elections so actually i am not happy he said
the electoral commission s yakubu attributed the decision to delays in transporting electoral materials
the postponement has nothing to do with security nothing to do with political influence nothing to do with availability of resources he told a gathering of foreign election observers and reporters
he said some sensitive election materials had been distributed but all had been retrieved and returned to the central bank and an audit would now be conducted
in nigeria the central bank stores election materials for safe keeping
pdp chairman uche secondus said the postponement was dangerous to our democracy
he called it part of an attempt by buhari to cling on to power even when it s obvious to him that nigerians want him out
buhari who was nigeria s military ruler in the early expressed disappointment over the delay but urged nigerians in a statement to refrain from all civil disorder and remain peaceful patriotic and united
atiku urged voters to be patient but later said buhari s administration was behind the delayed elections without offering any evidence
by instigating this postponement the buhari administration hopes to disenfranchise the nigerian electorate in order to ensure that turnout is low on the rescheduled date he said on twitter
buhari s spokesman garba shehu declined to comment
observer missions from the european union the african union and other organisations urged nigerians in a statement to remain calm and supportive of the election process and said the electoral commission must adhere strictly to the new date
no matter who wins it is now far more likely that the loser will contest the result and argue that the election has been compromised because sensitive materials are out there said bismarck rewane economist and ceo of consultancy finance derivatives
situation room an organisation of more than civil society groups said the postponement had harmed the credibility of the electoral commission creating needless tension and confusion
nigeria s presidential elections in and were also delayed over logistics and security issues
