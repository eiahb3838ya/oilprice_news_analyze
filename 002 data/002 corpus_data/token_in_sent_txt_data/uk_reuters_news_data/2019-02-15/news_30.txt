update 1-germany may change law to comply with eu pipeline rules - minister
adds details and context munich feb reuters germany is considering changes to the legal framework governing the nord stream gas pipeline to make sure that it complies with new european union regulations economy minister peter altmaier told reuters on friday
the eu this week agreed new rules for gas import pipelines stipulating that the pipelines should not be owned by gas suppliers and that third parties should also be able to use them
the new eu deal casts doubt over the structure of russia s planned nord stream pipeline which already faces uncertainty after denmark s potential ban on its planned route which includes danish territorial waters
altmaier said the pipeline could still be built under the new conditions but there would clearly be some changes
one regarding the ownership of the pipeline since european law requires ownership of pipeline and production to be separated altmaier said on the margins of the munich security conference
there may also be changes regarding who has access to the pipeline and who can feed the pipeline currently under construction under the baltic sea and fully owned by russia s gazprom is seen by berlin as a primarily commercial project that is essential to germany s ongoing energy security
but eastern european nordic and baltic sea countries see the km mile pipeline as increasing eu reliance on moscow
the project also faces opposition from washington
altmaier said it was in germany s interest that the pipeline be built together with our european partners but that any amendments to the project to allow it to meet the new conditions had to be germany s decision alone
