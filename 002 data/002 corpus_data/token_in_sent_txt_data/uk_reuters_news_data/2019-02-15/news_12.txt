british children walk out of lessons on climate strike
london reuters thousands of british children marched out of lessons on friday to demand action on climate change earning a mild rebuke from the prime minister s office for disrupting classes but praise from the energy minister and activists
youngsters marched on parliament square in london and gathered in other cities carrying banners marked with climate change is worse than homework act now for our future and other slogans
my teacher told me kids shouldn t be going out but we went because it s important rio told reuters
a spokeswoman for british prime minister theresa may said that while the government welcomed the students engagement the disruption to schools and lessons would be difficult for teachers
her energy minister claire perry however said she was incredibly proud of the young people while opposition labour leader jeremy corbyn expressed his support for the school kids of today whose futures are most on the line
earlier this week academics from oxford cambridge and other universities declared their support for the students in an open letter published in the guardian
those taking part in the strike have every right to be angry about the future that we shall bequeath to them if proportionate and urgent action is not taken they wrote
the british protests were part of a global school strike climate movement which began in august when swedish climate activist greta thunberg began protesting outside her parliament on school days
