exclusive-trafigura halts oil trade with venezuela - source
geneva reuters global commodities firm trafigura has decided to stop trading oil with venezuela due to sanctions on the opec nation s energy sector a source with direct knowledge of the matter said
the decision will come as a blow to caracas as trafigura has a arrangement with pdvsa to take venezuelan crude and in exchange supply the latin american country with refined products
washington imposed fresh sanctions on pdvsa last month to cut off a key source of revenue for president nicolas maduro
the move came after congress head juan guaido invoked constitutional provisions to become interim president arguing that socialist maduro s last year was a sham
last year trading company trafigura directly took barrels per day bpd of venezuelan crude and products which were mostly resold to and chinese refineries according to internal pdvsa trade documents seen by reuters
trafigura will stop business with pdvsa after completing a small number of trades the source said
due to the size of venezuela s agreements with china and russia and the weight of previous sanctions pdvsa has become increasingly reliant on intermediaries to export its crude and import refined products
pdvsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment
trafigura is due to load two cargoes of venezuelan crude before the end of february the source with direct knowledge and a shipping source said
it was not immediately clear whether these two tankers were the last of the trades or how many if any product tankers would be sent in return
for the trading firm the decision means giving up a source of crude supply for indian refiner nayara energy in which trafigura holds a near percent stake
nayara would still be able to buy venezuelan crude through russia s rosneft and other intermediaries
the sanctions limit refiners to paying for venezuelan oil by using escrow accounts that can not be accessed by maduro s government
foreign firms that use the financial system for oil trading or units are similarly restricted cutting off avenues for pdvsa to collect revenue
in an effort to ease domestic fuel shortages pdvsa s imports skyrocketed last year
its own refining system is hobbled by technical failure a lack of investment delayed maintenance and insufficient crude supply
in the last three months of venezuela exported about million bpd of crude and products
trading houses lifted bpd of that according to the pdvsa documents and refinitiv eikon data
exports to the united states venezuela s primary export customer have since dried up as well as those to other destinations with loaded tankers left stranded off venezuelan ports
