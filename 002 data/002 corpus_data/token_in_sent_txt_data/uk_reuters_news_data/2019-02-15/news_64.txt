rpt-column-oil price risks shift to upside: kemp
repeats without changes chartbook by john kemp london feb reuters oil traders no longer expect the market to be this year amid optimism a trade war will be averted and oil production growth will slow thanks to opec cuts and sanctions on venezuela
brent futures prices have jumped to almost per barrel up from just in late december and the highest for nearly three months
brent s calendar spread has swung into a backwardation of almost cents per barrel from a contango of more than late last year the strongest for almost four months
crude prices and spreads are being propelled higher by an almost perfect storm of increasing economic optimism or at least reducing pessimism opec cuts and unplanned supply disruptions
in recent days senior policymakers from both the united states and china have signalled trade negotiations are making good progress as fear of recession makes both sides more eager for a deal
more importantly the president has indicated the deadline for the next round of tariff increases could be extended based on recent progress even if not all issues have been resolved by march
oil consumption growth is likely to slow this year from the very rapid rates reported between and but if tariff increases can be avoided oil use should continue increasing at a moderate pace
meanwhile saudi arabia and its closest allies in opec have also acted early and aggressively to reduce production which should help eliminate the incipient surplus in the market
saudi arabia s oil minister has said the kingdom s production will fall to just million barrels per day in march from million in november saudi arabia goes on hunt for global oil and gas financial times
saudi arabia s willingness to act as swing producer has more than offset the limited cuts made by other members of the organisation and its allies led by russia
the kingdom has demonstrated its commitment to eliminating the market surplus and pushing prices higher even if it means tolerating poor compliance by other members of the group
at the same time iran s exports remain crimped by sanctions imposed in november with the expectation they will be lowered further from may when sanctions waivers are likely to become less generous
and sanctions on venezuela s oil company pdvsa have reduced the country s crude exports and tightened the global oil market even further
policymakers probably expected the venezuela sanctions would have little impact on global production since they were expected to result in the rapid removal of president nicolas maduro
but with the maduro administration digging in for a long confrontation traders have been forced to reappraise the possibility of a long disruption of exports that could last weeks or even months
production and consumption risks concentrated on the downside at the start of the year have therefore shifted to the upside in recent weeks
hedge fund positioning could accelerate the rise in prices and shift to backwardation
hedge funds and other money managers held an overall bullish position in brent futures and options equivalent to just million barrels at the start of february down from almost million at the end of september
portfolio managers overall bullish position has already risen by nearly million barrels over the last nine weeks but remains close to the lowest level for the last three years
funds hold just long bullish contracts for every short bullish one down from a ratio of almost just over four months ago so there is scope for more fund buying
production and consumption fundamentals as well as hedge fund positioning all suggest the balance of risks in oil has shifted to the upside but only if trade talks are successful or extended and recession is avoided
