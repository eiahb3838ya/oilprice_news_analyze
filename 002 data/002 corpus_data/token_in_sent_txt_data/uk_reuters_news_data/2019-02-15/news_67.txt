u.s. shale executives predict oil production constraints to remain
houston reuters drilling curbs by oil producers in the largest shale field will continue until transport bottlenecks ease and investors stop punishing companies for increasing capital spending executives at an energy conference said on thursday
the price of crude in the permian basin of west texas and new mexico fell sharply last year selling as much as below benchmark prices as a lack of pipeline capacity landlocked some oil output and as investors pushed producers to reduce spending and boost shareholder returns
on thursday the regional price of crude was at a a barrel premium to crude futures the strongest in more than a year as companies including parsley energy pioneer natural resources goodrich petroleum corp have pared their exploration budgets easing the constraints
pioneer natural resources co one of the permian s largest producers said this week it plans to reduce capital expenditures by percent or about million slowing its production growth from prior years
there aren t nearly as many drilling dollars available said bobby whiteside president of midland oil producer regions permian llc
if wall street wants you to drill within cash flow you re going to have slower the permian is the nation s largest and fastest growing oil field
its output has driven crude production to near million barrels per day bpd forcing opec and allies to cut their output
oil and gas officials interviewed at the houston conference say the recent shale cutbacks will remain until three proposed pipelines from west texas to the gulf coast come online over the next months
executives said the recent strengthening of regional crude prices suggest that producers can expect oil sold at midland texas to slip from the current premium to a to per barrel discount to benchmark crude in the second quarter
i don t think you ll see a big differential again unless they grow production over capacity said jacob daniels an employee of texas oil producer chisholm energy which drills in the permian
we re about at breakeven now and that has really helped us added brett bracken an exploration manager at permian oil producer ares energy ltd
the oil industry could easily meet the energy information administration s forecasts over the next two years if wall street still rewarded production growth over returns said allen gilmer founder of market intelligence provider drillinginfo
but with investors insisting on free cash flow and dividends maybe we won t gilmer said
