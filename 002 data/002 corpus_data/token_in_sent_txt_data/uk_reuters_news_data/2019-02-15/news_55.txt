rpt-as traders tussle over tankers, turkmenistan slashes oil exports
repeats story text unchanged vitol replaces socar as main shipper of turkmen oil socar refuses to provide tankers to vitol vitol scrambles for tankers charters ship turkmen oil exports plummet in by alexander ershov olga yagova and dmitry zhdannikov feb reuters a clash between trading house vitol and azerbaijan s socar over caspian sea oil shipments is forcing turkmenistan to slash exports of crude due to a lack of tankers
turkmenistan typically exports about tonnes of oil per year via the caspian to world markets mainly from fields operated by the uae s enoc and italy s eni but flows have halved in recent weeks six traders involved in operations said
that happened after turkmen producers decided to export oil via russia with the help of swiss trader vitol and ditch the previous azeri route operated by socar
the reasons behind the change are not fully clear but trading sources attributed it to pricing disagreements
three trading sources said socar had raised tariffs while one source said vitol had offered lower tariffs
the only problem was that vitol was lacking tankers one of the sources involved in operations said
vitol said it would not comment on commercial activity or trading
socar enoc and the turkmen energy ministry declined to comment
russian pipeline monopoly transneft did not respond to a request for comment
eni said it had not been forced to reduce exports or production and that the situation was stable
russian energy ministry data shows that no exports of turkmen oil occurred via russia in january
in february only tonnes will be loaded from the black sea port of novorossiisk
eni declined to say why its production and exports were stable after such a drop in shipments or whether it was stockpiling oil in turkmenistan
socar controls the caspian s largest fleet of small and tankers which used to ship turkmen oil to baku
from there it was loaded into the btc pipeline to the turkish mediterranean port of ceyhan
in turkmenistan enoc s dragon oil is developing the cheleken oilfield with annual output of some million tonnes
eni produces nearly tonnes per year from the okarem field
in crude from dragon oil was exported via btc through socar
eni also sold volumes to vitol which in turn resold it to socar
under new deals for this year dragon and eni chose vitol to export oil to the russian port of makhachkala where transneft is taking it to novorossiisk
upset by the development socar refused to let vitol use its tankers the six traders said
everyone is free to defend their commercial interests said a source at socar when asked about tankers
vitol has secured several tankers but these will be able to transport only around tonnes a month until the russian system becomes and opens to navigation in april trading sources said
shipments can then increase
the caspian tanker shortage was such that vitol had to charter old ships including the grigoriy bugrov a vessel that sank in and was later repaired
these vessels were chartered on an exceptional basis and only after physical inspection by an experienced professional
vitol is extremely mindful of its responsibilities in respect of customers stakeholders and the environment vitol said when asked about the bugrov tanker
the slowness of crude exports has forced turkmen producers to stockpile oil throughout january and february the six trading sources said
storage tanks are full so the turkmens now face the risk of suspending some production a market source familiar with the matter said
despite their modest volumes turkmen oil exports have always been a game
oil is bought in turkmenistan at a discount of several dollars per barrel to the dated brent benchmark
crude is then sold in the mediterranean at a premium to dated brent as azeri btc in case of shipments via azerbaijan or as siberian light which also normally trades at a premium to dated brent if it flows via russia s novorossiisk
losing turkmen crude means lower exports via btc and lower crude quality a trader with a european refiner said
for russia getting turkmen volumes does the opposite it helps improve the quality of oil in the pipeline system
azeri btc crude oil loadings are scheduled to fall some percent in march versus february
the situation regarding quality was not critical the socar source said
negotiations about getting oil from turkmenistan are not over we hope there is a chance that we will get some turkmen oil volumes the socar source added
