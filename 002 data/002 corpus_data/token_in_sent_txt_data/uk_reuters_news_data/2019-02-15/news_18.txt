exclusive-india advises refiner to avoid u.s. system for venezuela oil buying - source
new delhi reuters india has asked one buyer of venezuelan oil to consider paying the south american nation s national oil company pdvsa in a way that avoids the financial system an indian government source said after washington imposed fresh sanctions on venezuela last month
the united states is seeking to cut off venezuela s oil revenue and pressure the nation s president nicolas maduro to step down after it recognised opposition leader juan guaido as head of state
the sanctions mean that if oil buyers pay pdvsa through the banking system the funds could be seized by authorities
there may also be problems for transactions by banks that have a heavy presence even if they aren t in dollars and don t go through the united states
the indian buyer expressed concern that there could be a problem in payments to pdvsa so we have advised them to move away from the banking and institutional mechanism said the source who did not wish to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter
he declined to name the buyer
most western countries have recognised guaido as venezuela s interim head of state but maduro retains the backing of russia and china as well as control of state institutions including the military
the sanctions limit refiners to paying for venezuelan oil by using escrow accounts that can not be accessed by maduro s government
india still recognises maduro as venezuela s leader which means it does not make sense to shift to the other escrow payment avenue the source said
india s foreign ministry on thursday said the country was monitoring the evolving situation in venezuela
we are of the view that it is for the people of venezuela to find a political solution to resolve the political differences through constructive dialogue and discussion without resorting to violence ministry spokesman raveesh kumar said
purchases of oil are based on commercial factors he said

top importers of venezuelan crude the sanctions have forced venezuela to turn its focus increasingly to asia to sell its oil
india s reliance industries ltd operator of the world s biggest refining complex and nayara energy by russian oil major rosneft and trader trafigura are the two indian buyers of venezuelan oil
trafigura itself has decided to stop trading oil with venezuela due to sanctions
india s oil ministry reliance and nayara did not respond to reuters emails seeking comment for this story
venezuelan oil minister manuel quevedo this week travelled to india in an attempt to convince refiners to boost their purchases
the opec member aims to double oil sales to india from the current barrels per day he said
quevedo told reporters he would like to see the creation of a trading bloc involving china india and russia
after quevedo s visit white house national security advisor john bolton tweeted nations and firms that support maduro s theft of venezuelan resources will not be forgotten
the united states will continue to use all of its powers to preserve the venezuelan people s assets and we encourage all nations to work together to do the same
in a note to clients on tuesday banking group barclays said it would be difficult for venezuela to find new markets in asia given the stringent nature of the sanctions
considering all the difficulties that venezuela faces in delivering oil to other markets and the legal reputational and financial risks confronting traders or counterparties that do business with it under the current conditions the bank wrote it seems unlikely that all production can in short order go to other reporting by nidhi verma editing by martin howell and dale hudson
