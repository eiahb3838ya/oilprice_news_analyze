trump says he wants to go slower on sanctions for iran's oil
joint base andrews nov reuters president donald trump on monday said he wants to impose sanctions on iran s oil gradually citing concerns about shocking energy markets and causing global price spikes
with the oil it s very interesting
we have the toughest sanctions ever imposed but on oil we want to go a little bit slower because i don t want to drive up the oil prices in the world he told reporters before flying to a campaign event
this has nothing to do with iran
i could get the iran oil down to zero immediately but it would cause a shock to the market
i don t want to lift oil reporting by roberta rampton writing by lisa lambert editing by james dalgleish
