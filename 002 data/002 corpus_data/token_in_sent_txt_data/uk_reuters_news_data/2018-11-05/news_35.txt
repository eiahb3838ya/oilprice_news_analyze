washington nov reuters the united states and strengthened economic sanctions on iran s oil banking and transportation sectors on monday after the trump administration withdrew from the iran nuclear deal and vowed further action to pressure tehran
treasury s imposition of unprecedented financial pressure on iran should make clear to the iranian regime that they will face mounting financial isolation and economic stagnation until they fundamentally change their destabilizing behavior treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in a statement
the sanctions cover iranian banks and subsidiaries more than persons and vessels in its shipping sector and targets tehran s national airline iran air and more than of its aircraft the statement said
