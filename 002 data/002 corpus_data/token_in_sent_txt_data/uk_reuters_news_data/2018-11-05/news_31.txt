update 1-swift says suspending some iranian banks' access to messaging system
adds quote from statement background washington nov reuters the swift financial messaging service said on monday it is suspending some unspecified iranian banks access to its messaging system in the interest of the stability and integrity of the global financial system
in a brief statement swift made no mention of sanctions coming back into effect on some iranian financial institutions on monday as part of president donald trump s effort to force iran to curtail its nuclear missile and regional activities
the swift statement said suspending the iranian banks access to the messaging system was a regrettable step but was taken in the interest of the stability and integrity of the wider global financial having abandoned the iran nuclear deal trump is trying to cripple iran s economy and force tehran to quash not only its nuclear ambitions and its ballistic missile program but its support for militant proxies in syria yemen lebanon and other parts of the middle east
swift s decision not to mention the resumption of sanctions likely reflects the fact that it is caught between two contrary regulatory demands
the government has told swift that it is expected to comply with sanctions and it could face sanctions if it fails to do so
on the other hand swift is barred from doing so under the european union s blocking statute which could subject it to european penalties for complying with law
