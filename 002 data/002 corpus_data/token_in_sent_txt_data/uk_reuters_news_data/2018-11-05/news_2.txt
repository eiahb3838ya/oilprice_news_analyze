toxin in u.s. corn harvest poses latest headache for farmers
chicago reuters north american farmers are finding increased levels of a plant toxin known as vomitoxin in this year s corn harvest adding insult to injury for growers already suffering as the trade war hurts soybean exports and crop prices
vomitoxin sickens livestock and can also make humans and pets fall ill and grain buyers can reject cargoes or fine farmers for shipments that contain it
more cases than normal are likely in the corn crop because wet weather this autumn caused the fungus to develop while delaying harvests iowa state university grain quality expert charles hurburgh said on monday
about of corn is used domestically to feed livestock and make ethanol and a byproduct called distillers dried grains that is fed to animals
however livestock and ethanol producers need to blend corn that contains vomitoxin with corn that does not to make it suitable for feed when toxin levels are high
hogs don t like the taste and don t like the smell
they will literally starve to death before eating it said indiana grain inspector doug titus of titus grain inspection whose company has labs at andersons inc a crop handler and energy company valero energy corp sites
the quality worries come as farm income has plunged by half over the past five years and as the deepening trade war harms demand for soybeans the most valuable agricultural export product to china and one frequently rotated with corn
wh group ltd s smithfield foods inc the world s biggest pork producer has detected vomitoxin in corn in iowa and nebraska where it is not normally a problem a source with knowledge of the situation said
the company which feeds corn to hogs did not immediately respond to a request for comment
the food and drug administration allows vomitoxin levels of up to one part per million ppm in human and pet foods and recommends levels under five ppm in grain for hogs ppm for chickens and dairy cattle
beef cattle can withstand toxin levels up to ppm
andersons is warning farmers delivering corn to an ethanol plant in albion michigan that corn with vomitoxin levels above five ppm is subject to rejection
ethanol plants in michigan and ohio are also testing corn deliveries for the toxin and charging farmers financial penalties if their loads contain too much a grain dealer in michigan said
in upstate new york farmers are feeding dairy cattle with millfeeds a byproduct of wheat flour milling instead of contaminated corn according to a feed broker in upstate new york
prices for millfeeds rose about per ton to per ton for trucks in buffalo new york on monday
problems stretched over the border into canada too
i m already getting the panic button pushed in canada in ontario said max hawkins a nutritionist with alltech inc a feed supplement company
alltech had tested samples of this year s corn harvest as of friday and found percent contained vomitoxin hawkins said
that is about average hawkins said but he expected further testing to reveal bigger problems
more samples have not been examined yet because of the rains that delayed harvesting which was percent complete as of sunday
it s going to get worse hawkins said
