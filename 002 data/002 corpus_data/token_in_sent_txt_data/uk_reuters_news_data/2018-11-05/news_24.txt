feature-power ahoy! floating solar panels buoy access to clean energy in asia
london nov thomson reuters foundation when the worst floods in a century swept through india s southern kerala state in august they killed more than people and left behind more than billion in damage
but one thing survived unscathed india s first floating solar panels on one of the country s largest water reservoirs
as india grapples with wilder weather surging demand for power and a goal to nearly quintuple the use of solar energy in just four years we are very much excited about floating solar said shailesh mishra director of power systems at the government solar energy corporation of india
india is planning new installations of the technology on hydropower reservoirs and other water bodies in tamil nadu jharkhand and uttarakhand states and in the lakshadweep islands he told the thomson reuters foundation
the cost is coming almost to the same level as ground solar and then it will go forward very fast he predicted
as countries move to swiftly scale up solar power to meet growing demand for energy and to try to curb climate change floating solar panels installed on reservoirs or along coastal areas are fast gaining popularity particularly in asia experts say
the panels now in place from china to the maldives to britain get around some of the biggest problems facing traditional solar farms particularly a lack of available land said oliver knight a senior energy specialist with the world bank
the water body is already there you don t need to go out and find it he said in a telephone interview
and siting solar arrays on water most cover up to percent of a reservoir can cut evaporation as well a significant benefit in places knight said
pakistan s new government for instance is talking about using floating solar panels on water reservoirs near karachi and hyderabad both to provide power and to curb water losses as climate change brings hotter temperatures and more evaporation he said
solar arrays on hydropower dams also can take advantage of existing power transmission lines and excess solar can be used to pump water effectively storing it as hydropower potential
china currently has the most of the gigawatts of floating solar generating capacity now installed according to the world bank
but the technology s potential is much bigger about gigawatts or about as much generating capacity as all the solar photovoltaic panels installed in the world through the bank said
if you covered percent of manmade water bodies you re already looking at gigawatts knight said
that s very growing use of the technology has raised fears that it could block sun into reservoirs affecting wildlife and ecosystems or that electrical systems might not stand up to a watery environment particularly in salty coastal waters
but backers say that while environmental concerns need to be better studied the relatively small amount of surface area covered by the panels at least at the moment doesn t appear to create significant problems
people worried what will happen to fish to water quality said india s mishra
now all that attention has what may be more challenging is keeping panels working and free of colonising sea creatures in corrosively salty coastal installations which account for a relatively small percentage of total projects so far noted thomas reindl of the solar energy research institute of singapore
he said he expects the technology will draw more investment when durability and reliability has been proven in real world installations
currently floating solar arrays cost about percent more than traditional solar photovoltaic arrays knight said but that cost is often offset by other lower costs
in many places one has to pay for land for resettlement of people or preparing and leveling land and building roads he said
with floating solar you avoid quite a bit of solar panels used on water which cools them also can produce about percent more electricity he said
mishra said that while in his view india has sufficient land for traditional solar installations much of it is in remote areas inhospitable to agriculture including deserts
putting solar panels on water by comparison cuts transmission costs by moving power generation closer to the people who need the energy he said
he said india already makes the solar panels it needs and is now setting up manufacturing for the floats and anchors needed for floating solar systems
when that capacity is in place then the cost will automatically come down he predicted
