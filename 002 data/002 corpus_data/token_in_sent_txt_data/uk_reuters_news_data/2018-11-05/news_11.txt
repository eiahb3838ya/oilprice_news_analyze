wrapup 8-u.s. reimposes iran sanctions, tehran decries 'bullying'
reuters the united states on monday restored sanctions targeting iran s oil banking and transportation sectors and threatened more action to stop its outlaw policies steps the islamic republic called economic warfare and vowed to defy
the measures are part of a wider effort by president donald trump to curb tehran s missile and nuclear programs and diminish the islamic republic s influence in the middle east notably its support for proxies in syria yemen and lebanon
trump s moves target iran s main source of revenue its oil exports as well as its financial sector essentially making iranian banks and their subsidiaries off limits to foreign banks on pain of losing access to the financial system
the return of the sanctions was triggered by trump s may decision to abandon the iran nuclear deal negotiated with five other world powers during democratic president barack obama s administration
that agreement had removed many and other economic sanctions from iran in return for tehran s commitment to curtail its nuclear programme
trump denounced the deal because of time limits on some of iran s nuclear activities as well as for its failure to address other iranian activity that the united states does not like
in abandoning the agreement and imposing sanctions that it had lifted as well as adding new ones the united states is betting the economic pressure will force iran to change its behaviour and agree to a new much more restrictive deal
the iranian regime has a choice it can either do a turn from its outlaw course of action and act like a normal country or it can see its economy crumble secretary of state mike pompeo told reporters
we hope a new agreement with iran is speaking before pompeo detailed the sanctions iranian president hassan rouhani accused the united states of targeting ordinary iranians and said the islamic republic would find a way to continue to sell our oil to break the enemy is targeting our economy the main target of sanctions is our people he said
this is an economic war against some analysts are sceptical iran will knuckle under to pressure at least in the short term
the increasing pressures on iran will not change the behaviour of the regime any time soon said dennis ross a former official now at the washington institute for near east policy
iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said bullying was backfiring by making washington more isolated a reference to other world powers opposed to the initiative
the other parties to the nuclear deal britain china france germany and russia have said they will stay in it
the sanctions are designed in part to force iran s main customers to stop buying its oil
however the united states gave temporary exceptions to eight importers china india greece italy taiwan japan turkey and south korea allowing them to keep buying from iran
iraq has also been given an exemption brian hook the special representative for iran told reporters in a conference call saying iraq was working on reducing iran s influence and opening kirkuk which would be another barrels of in june iran said that baghdad and tehran had begun exchanging crude oil
crude from the kirkuk field in northern iraq is being shipped by truck to iran
tehran will use the oil in its refineries and will deliver the same amount of oil to iraq s southern ports on the gulf
the sanctions also cover iranian banks and subsidiaries more than persons and vessels in its shipping sector tehran s national airline iran air and more than of its aircraft a treasury statement said
the administration said it had toughened the sanctions by roughly new designations on individuals and entities and targeted more subsidiaries of iranian companies than before
european powers that continue to back the nuclear deal said they opposed the reapplication of sanctions and major oil buyer china said it regretted the move
switzerland said it was holding talks with the united states and iran about launching a humanitarian payment channel to help food and drugs keep flowing to tehran
sanctions permit trade in humanitarian goods such as food and pharmaceuticals but measures imposed on banks and trade restrictions could make such items more expensive as well as more difficult to pay for
the united states will allow civil nuclear work at arak bushehr and fordow in iran under the strictest scrutiny the state department said on monday
the swift financial messaging service said it is suspending some unspecified iranian banks access to its messaging system in the interests of the stability and integrity of the global financial system
the head of iran s central bank abdolnassr hemmati said the country has taken necessary banking measures to continue trade after the move iranian state tv said
the european union france germany and britain said they regretted the decision and would seek to protect european companies doing legitimate business with tehran
diplomats told reuters last month that a new eu mechanism to facilitate payments for iranian oil exports should be legally in place by but not operational until early next year
trump told reporters he wanted to impose the oil sanctions slowly so as not to cause a shock to the oil prices were mixed on monday after a steep fall
brent crude futures rose cents to settle at a barrel
west texas intermediate wti crude futures fell cents to settle at a barrel
prices rallied to near highs in early october on expectations the imposition of sanctions would create a global supply shortage
however news of the waivers last week sent prices lower as top buyers would continue to import iranian oil
