update 1-supreme court mulls virginia ban on mining biggest u.s. uranium deposit
washington reuters supreme court justices hearing a challenge to virginia s moratorium on uranium mining struggled on monday over how far states can go to ban mining of the radioactive metal for public health reasons before overstepping federal law
the justices heard an hour of arguments in an appeal by a company called virginia uranium inc seeking to revive a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court that aimed to invalidate virginia s ban enacted in
the company has said that ban conflicts with a federal law regulating nuclear power generation
at the center of the dispute is the uranium deposit located beneath a privately owned estate in pittsylvania county in southern virginia near the north carolina border
the company a subsidiary of vancouver british virginia energy resources is seeking to exploit the deposit valued at about billion
uranium a main source of fuel for nuclear power plants and material in nuclear warheads represents a vital resource for electricity and national defense
virginia enacted its ban on uranium mining amid concerns about environmental and public safety hazards
liberal justice stephen breyer and conservative justice samuel alito signaled that courts should look to the virginia legislators motives in passing the law to determine whether it regulates only mining as virginia argues or tries to curb radiological hazards a matter that must be left to the federal government
i think that s our job as a court in a relevant case to determine what the purpose is breyer said
some liberal justices as well as conservative justice neil gorsuch appeared to side with the state
gorsuch told
solicitor general noel francisco who argued on behalf of president donald trump s administration in support of the company s position that the congress could have prevented states from regulating uranium mining but did not
so why isn t that the end of the case gorsuch asked
francisco responded that if the justices uphold the lower court s decision it really is a roadmap for completely undermining a the company has extolled the economic benefits for virginia saying uranium mining could mean more than a thousand jobs annually and billions of dollars for the local economy
it has also emphasized uranium s critical importance in nuclear weapons and powering nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers noting that most uranium used in the united states is imported including from geopolitical rivals such as russia
the dispute concerns whether the federal atomic energy act of preempts virginia s mining ban under the constitution s supremacy clause which holds that federal law generally trumps state law
the atomic energy act gives the federal nuclear regulatory commission the sole power to regulate radiation safety standards for milling uranium ore and disposing of waste byproducts known as tailings key steps in the production of nuclear fuel
but it does not cover conventional uranium mining on land
virginia has said federal law specifically allows it to ban uranium mining
it has the support of several other states concerned about protecting states rights including indiana texas massachusetts and oregon
the plaintiffs also including cole hill llc and bowen minerals llc sued virginia in
the richmond
circuit court of appeals last year upheld a trial judge s ruling to toss out the lawsuit
