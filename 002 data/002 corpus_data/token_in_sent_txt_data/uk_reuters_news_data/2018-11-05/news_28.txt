golar looks to nigeria to expand power footprint
london nov reuters golar lng said on monday it was in talks with nigerian authorities about setting up a power project that could use one of its vessels to import liquefied natural gas lng
the company wants to expand beyond its core lng shipping and terminals business and owns half of the billion sergipe power plant project in brazil in which it will also provide a floating storage and regasification unit fsru to take delivery of lng
golar s chief commercial officer robert carter said the company was looking into a fully integrated gas and power project in the state of lagos
we re in discussions with nigerian authorities
we re trying to develop a terminal there that could include the utilisation of domestic lng supplies carter told reuters after local media reported the potential talks
projects tend to comprise an lng import terminal such as an fsru vessel infrastructure such as pipelines for the regasified gas and a power plant which uses the gas as feedstock to produce electricity
nigeria is a massive oil and gas producer with a large lng export terminal but still needs to import fuels for vehicles and suffers power shortages due to poor infrastructure and chaotic governance of its energy sector
golar has a fleet of lng carriers and eight fsrus but has said it plans to expand into the broader lng business by operating production facilities at the upstream end and participating in power projects at the downstream end
we don t invest in a project where there isn t a golar flag so to speak carter said when asked whether golar would provide an fsru for the nigerian project
we re talking about a golar on the sergipe project golar owns percent of the company operating a megawatt power plant and associated infrastructure and will provide an fsru
it said on monday the project is on track to start operations in january
all of golar s fsrus which can also be used as conventional lng carriers are currently in use aside from the golar tundra which is being used in the spot lng market
