nigeria's nnpc says shell, exxonmobil also looking at crude swaps
cape town nov reuters nigeria s state oil firm nnpc could sign deals with shell and exxonmobil similar to one signed with bp last week a senior nnpc official said on monday
nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc announced last wednesday that it had signed such a deal with bp and would provide more details later
unfortunately shell and exxonmobil exited the downstream sector in nigeria a couple of years ago but they are coming back for this particular arrangement because it s an opportunity for them to get crude and sell their products to the refineries nnpc s chief operating officer for upstream bello rabiu told reuters on the sidelines of an african oil and gas conference in cape town
nnpc imports about percent of nigeria s fuel needs mainly gasoline via swap contracts
nnpc has contracts known as direct sale direct purchase agreements with consortiums that include trading houses vitol trafigura mercuria and total
it extended the existing contracts to june but several trading sources in the consortiums said they had requested new price terms
rabiu said nnpc hoped in to emulate savings of around billion seen in with its swaps which he said would likely end once africa s top crude producer revamps its refineries
if our refineries are back which we want in the next months this thing will stop
so all these things are just measures but the key issue is that we wanted to import at the least cost before our refineries come back onstream he said
nnpc is in the final stages of talks with consortiums including top traders energy majors and oil services companies to revamp its oil refineries in an effort to reduce its reliance on imported fuel
it is on track and i believe if we don t sign a final deal on the project to upgrade refineries this month of november we will surely sign in december rabiu said
