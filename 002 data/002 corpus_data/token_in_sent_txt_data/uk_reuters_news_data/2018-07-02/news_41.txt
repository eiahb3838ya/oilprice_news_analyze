global markets-asia shares sluggish, mexico peso up on exit polls
mexico exit polls point to clear win for leftist obrador asia shares muted markets count down to tariff deadline euro wobbles on threat to immigration deal oil eases as trump says saudis ready to expand supply by wayne cole sydney july reuters asian shares were subdued monday ahead of a week packed with major economic events while mexico s peso firmed as exit polls pointed to a decisive victory for presidential andres manuel lopez obrador s party
dealers said the seemingly clear win would at least settle one source of political uncertainty
yet leftist obrador is also expected to inject a dose of nationalism into government and sharpen divisions with president donald trump
oil prices had taken an early spill after trump tweeted that saudi arabia had agreed to lift oil production by maybe up to barrels
the missive was later downplayed by the white house and saudi press agency
brent crude was down cents at a barrel while crude fell cents to
the pullback was modest given crude rallied more than percent last week while brent gained more than percent
in share markets japan s nikkei dipped percent with a survey of manufacturers showing sentiment had darkened a shade in the face of trade war threats
the purchasing managers index pmi still edged higher for june though exports orders softened
msci s broadest index of shares outside japan was a fraction firmer in early trade
the index shed percent last week as trade concerns clouded the outlook for chinese growth and pressured asset prices there
tension is growing ahead of a july deadline when the is due to impose us billion of tariffs on chinese exports
the key risk for the market isn t that trump actually implements his trade threats but rather that a protracted period of trade uncertainty begins to weigh on economic activity said analysts at jpmorgan in a note
the evidence suggesting this is happening is far from conclusive but ominous data points are a survey out over the weekend showed chinese manufacturing activity cooled a little in june as export orders fell
the official purchasing managers index pmi eased in june from in may
a slew of readings on manufacturing across the globe are due later on monday while the ism report is out on tuesday
minutes of the last federal reserve policy meeting come on thursday and the week closes with payrolls for june
in currency markets the euro took a brief early knock on reports german interior minister horst seehofer had rejected a migration deal german chancellor angela merkel negotiated at a european union summit on friday
the currency then bounced on news seehofer had offered to step down as minister and as chair of his christian social union csu party
the move makes the future of merkel s government even more uncertain as her christian democrats party cdu relies on the csu to maintain power through a coalition formed three months ago to end a political vacuum
after all that the euro was a fraction easier at having skidded as far as at one stage
the dollar was a touch firmer on a basket of currencies at having recoiled from a top on friday
it added percent on the yen to and was again testing stiff resistance around
