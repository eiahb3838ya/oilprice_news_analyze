update 2-solar trade row with china forces rec silicon to cut u.s. jobs
oslo reuters norway s rec silicon a supplier of silicon materials to the solar industry will cut around jobs and take further asset impairments due to a trade war over solar panels it said on monday
the company has been unable to sell its goods in china since as a result of the dispute between the world s two largest economies leading to several rounds of redundancies at its two plants
the firm said on monday it would lay off around percent of the employees at its moses lake plant in the state of washington and cut production there to about percent of capacity
its shares were down percent at gmt lagging an oslo benchmark index down percent having already fallen percent over the past five years
china has imposed tariffs on imports of polysilicon a key element to make solar panels that rec silicon produces while the united states slapped tariffs on solar panel imports starting in and with a latest round in january
the company has another plant in montana which is unaffected by the latest job cuts
some workers at that plant were laid off in september and were laid off at the moses lake plant in
it is really sad
we can t access the market
we don t want subsidies
we just want fair access ceo tore torvund told a conference call
rec silicon also said it expected to report additional impairments when it publishes results on july
revenue was expected at million it said adding it had about million in cash
current market conditions will negatively impact the company s profitability and credit risk exposure it said
rec silicon did not say how much the impairments would be
we make a strong demand to the present administration to find a solution so that we can continue to operate out of the said torvund reiterating calls the firm made in january after washington introduced tariffs on imports of solar panels
we are very dependent on the administration going to the administration in china so that we can continue to operate polysilicon out of the united states he said adding the company was because it held technology others did not have
