china carbon emissions in retreat after 'structural break' in economy - study
shanghai reuters china s carbon dioxide emissions fell from to and might already have peaked according to a study published on monday with structural economic changes allowing beijing to meet targets earlier than expected
china vowed before the paris climate talks in to bring emissions to a peak by around and the country s top climate official xie zhenhua has already said it could meet the pledge ahead of time
but the study published by nature geoscience said in retrospect the commitment may have been fulfilled even as it was being made with emissions hitting a record gigatonnes in and declining in the following three years dropping to gigatonnes in
while emissions rose by an average of percent per year from to china s economy underwent a structural break in and is shifting to less high technology sectors it said
unless there is a significant amount of change a large government intervention like the stimulus package of then china s emissions will stabilize and gradually go down said dabo guan a professor of climate change economics at the university of east anglia uea one of the authors of the study
in may environment group greenpeace estimated that china s emissions rose percent in the first quarter of after increasing percent last year adding that backsliding on earlier progress could result in china s biggest annual rise in emissions since this year
i would have genuinely wanted it to have peaked in but given the increase in and first few months in i am cautious said chan head of the climate change department at hsbc adding that coal consumption remained a major component of china s energy mix
but the uea s guan said calculations for are incomplete and fail to take into account rising coal quality efficiency improvements or land use changes that could have taken more out of the system
an early chinese peak in emissions would bolster arguments that the paris agreement is too lenient on the country an argument made by president donald trump when he vowed to withdraw from the deal last year
guan said it is clear the original target of around was conservative but the ultimate issue was not when china peaked but at what level
even if we peak in and if it reaches gigatonnes it would also be a disaster he said
