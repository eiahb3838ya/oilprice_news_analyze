arclight capital partners a private equity firm expects the former hovensa refinery on croix to be able to process barrels per day of crude and deliver fuels to market by january officials said at a news conference on the island
the company spent two years studying the market and developed a refinery profile we see thriving in the current marketplace said john erhard an arclight partner
it aims to produce fuels that meet an international maritime organization mandate calling for large vessels to switch by to fuels containing no more than percent sulfur from percent the company has said
if the renamed limetree bay refinery can be refurbished to produce the fuels in the next months it could benefit from expected lower prices for heavy crude and strong demand for its fuels said analysts

as part of its agreement with the usvi government limetree has purchased acres of land and more than homes surrounding the refinery to facilitate the restart virgin islands governor kenneth mapp said in an interview
