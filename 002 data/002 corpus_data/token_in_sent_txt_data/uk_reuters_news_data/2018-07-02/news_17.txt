grid operator warns wind will not fill sweden's nuclear gap in winter
oslo reuters sweden will have to import more electricity during winter as the country a net power exporter to the rest of europe shifts from nuclear to wind its grid operator said
last winter the first since the closure of its oskarshamn reactor stretched sweden s resources as peak consumption rose by megawatt mw triggering procedures in its reserve energy plants
sweden s power balance will deteriorate further from next winter the country will need imports and the situation will become worse with two more of its reactors closing by svenska kraftnat svk said in a report on monday
for next winter if it s a normal winter we expect sweden to need to import mw more than it exports during the hour with the highest consumption svk s electricity system analyst erik hellstrom and the author of the report told reuters
hellstrom said that if the coming winter is a winter colder than a normal winter sweden s imports will rise by as much as mw more than it exports in the hour with the highest consumption
of sweden s eight remaining nuclear reactors two will close soon ringhals in and ringhals the year after cutting a combined production of mw from its power system percent of which is nuclear
wind power can not contribute to the power balance during winter peak hours with the same availability as the nuclear power it replaces svk said
the expansion of sweden s wind power capacity with new farms coming into the system may also be insufficient to cover the deficit the lost nuclear reactors leaves said svk warning low profitability may even prohibit planned power projects
the margins for the swedish power balance and the ability to be with enough electricity under situations are shrinking said the report
the highest electricity consumption sweden recorded last winter was about mw said the grid nearly percent of the whole nordic region
sweden will need to add a further gigawatt gw in power generation capacity by to avoid power shortages svk said last year as the country will risk electricity shortfalls of hours per year on average
