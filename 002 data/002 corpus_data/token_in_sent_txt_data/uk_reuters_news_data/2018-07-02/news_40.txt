global markets-china shares slip anew, mexico peso up as obrador wins
mexico exit polls point to clear win for leftist obrador china shares ease markets count down to tariff deadline euro wobbles on threat to immigration deal oil off as trump says saudis ready to expand supply by wayne cole sydney july reuters asian share markets were burdened by fresh losses in china on monday while mexico s peso firmed as exit polls pointed to a decisive victory for presidential andres manuel lopez obrador s party
dealers said the clear win would at least settle one source of political uncertainty
yet leftist obrador is also expected to inject a dose of nationalism into government and sharpen divisions with president donald trump
the dollar was down percent at pesos not far from last week s trough around
trump also loomed large in oil markets with crude taking a spill after he tweeted that saudi arabia had agreed to lift oil production by maybe up to barrels
the missive was later downplayed by the white house and saudi press agency
brent crude lost to a barrel while crude fell cents to
the pullback was modest given crude rallied more than percent last week while brent gained more than percent

the currency then bounced on news seehofer had offered to step down as minister and as chair of his christian social union csu party
the move makes the future of merkel s government even more uncertain as her christian democrats party cdu relies on the csu to maintain power through a coalition formed three months ago to end a political vacuum
after all that the euro was percent easier at having skidded as far as at one stage
the dollar was a touch firmer on a basket of currencies at having recoiled from a top on friday
it added percent on the yen to and was again testing stiff resistance above
