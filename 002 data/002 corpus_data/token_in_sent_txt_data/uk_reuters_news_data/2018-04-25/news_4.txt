petrobras scraps liquigas ipo, eyes antitrust risk in sale -sources
sao paulo april reuters petroleo brasileiro sa has given up on the idea of selling its brazilian liquefied petroleum gas lpg unit through an initial public offering ipo and decided to reopen a sale process three people with knowledge of the matter said
the oil company has not yet set a date for interested companies to deliver bids and is still discussing the best way to avoid problems with antitrust authorities the sources added asking for anonymity because talks are private
petrobras as the company is known has sounded out banks and investors for a potential ipo of liquigas distribuidora sa but advisers said it would be a hard sell especially to international investors according to the sources
liquigas sells gas cylinders used mainly for cooking in brazilian households not served by gas pipelines a segment unfamiliar to investors in more developed markets
petrobras had agreed to sell the subsidiary to a unit of ultrapar participações sa in for billion reais million but brazilian antitrust watchdog cade blocked the deal
ultragaz a unit of ultrapar is brazil s largest lpg distributor and liquigas is the second biggest
in talks with banks petrobras has discussed how to structure the sale process without triggering antitrust issues
the easiest solution would be a sale to foreign buyers with similar businesses such as turkey s aygaz as or chile s empresas copec sa sources said
some of the brazilian rivals that bid for the asset are still interested such as copagaz distribuidora de gas
but a sale to a brazilian rival would be trickier and some representatives of brazilian companies have been lobbying petrobras to break up the subsidiary before the sale one of the sources said
a third option would be to require proposals that already include remedies for potential antitrust concerns
so far no decision has been taken the sources added
petrobras responded to a request for comment by referring to a previous securities filing in which it said details of the deal had not been defined
copagaz aygaz and copec did not immediately comment on the matter
