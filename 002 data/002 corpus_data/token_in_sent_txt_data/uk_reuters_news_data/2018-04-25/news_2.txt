insight-chevron evacuates venezuela executives following staff arrests
reuters oil major chevron corp has evacuated executives from venezuela after two of its workers were imprisoned over a contract dispute with oil company pdvsa according to four sources familiar with the matter
chevron asked other employees to avoid the facilities of its joint venture with the opec nation s oil firm the sources said
the arrests in a raid by national intelligence officers were the first at a foreign oil firm since venezuela s government launched a purge last fall that has resulted in detentions of more than executives at pdvsa and business partners accused of corruption
the chevron workers may face charges of treason for refusing to sign a supply contract for furnace parts drawn up by pdvsa executives reuters reported earlier this week
the workers balked at the high costs of the parts and a lack of competitive bids
venezuela s foreign minister jorge arreaza linked the chevron arrests to the government probe for the first time on wednesday
in our oil industry and in its relationships with other countries there has been corruption arreaza said at a news conference at the united nations headquarters in new york that was broadcast on venezuela state television
the decisions of the prosecutor s office are based on serious investigations to fight corruption
these two people involved have the right to defence and due of chevron s evacuation of executives arreaza said the logical decision would be to turn themselves over to authorities and demonstrate their innocence not to chevron spokeswoman isabel ordonez responded to the minister s comments with a written statement that the firm abides by a code of business ethics under which we comply with all applicable and venezuelan chevron s move to evacuate its expatriate workforce underscores the how arduous it has become for foreign oil firms and their workers to sustain operations through venezuela s accelerating political and economic meltdown
the affected staff numbers about people in the coastal city of puerto la cruz
chevron s ordonez said the company had an executive team overseeing operations in venezuela but declined to provide details on the leadership there or the number and type of workers the company had withdrawn
last week the company said it was working for the release of the detained workers carlos algarra and rene vasquez who are represented by chevron lawyers
chevron has no plans to exit the country according to a person familiar with the thinking of its board of directors
the oil company has not pulled out of other tough environments in the past the person said citing the jailing of employees in indonesia in and the firm believes venezuela will eventually stabilise
chevron the world s publicly traded oil producer with revenue of billion operates in venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects across the nation
the firm has about employees in its puerto la cruz headquarters and has two more offices in the country
its earnings from venezuela dropped percent last year to million million according to regulatory filings
the arrests mark an escalation of tensions between pdvsa and foreign companies over control of supply contracts and the joint ventures governance sources familiar with the dispute told reuters
outside firms say they are increasingly faced with impossible dilemmas
if their executives sign contracts without following their companies due process rules they run the risk of violating compliance standards meant to control costs and guard against corruption
if they don t sign they stoke tension with their partners at pdvsa which has a controlling interest in all joint ventures
companies evaluating an exit from venezuela have limited options because few if any international firms would pay anything close to full value for assets in the country amid the ongoing turmoil according to interviews with three executives of oil firms that have operated in venezuela
but continuing operations often means stomaching steep losses taking massive and now the threat of having staff arrested by the embattled socialist government of president nicolas maduro
pdvsa s deteriorating infrastructure and cash flow have caused oil production to plunge percent in a year to million barrels per day bpd in march according to official data reported to opec
venezuela s oil output so far this year is at a low
the falling production and arrests of pdvsa executives on allegations of corruption picked up speed late last year after maduro named a military chief with no oil industry experience major general manuel quevedo as the nation s oil minister and president of pdvsa
several of chevron s foreign staff and some local executives and their families left venezuela starting last week after the arrests the four sources familiar with their departures told reuters
they described the situation as temporary and said executives may return if proposed talks between chevron and pdvsa to resolve the dispute are successful
chevron executives have had meetings with venezuelan government officials this week said two of the people familiar with the matter
chevron and other firms aim to avoid a repeat of what happened to exxon mobil corp and conocophillips in venezuela in when the government of hugo chavez expropriated their assets after they could not reach an agreement to convert their projects into joint ventures
no company can leave because it would lose the assets said a former negotiator of exxon s exit from venezuela
at this point there are just a few chevron employees remaining in venezuela are concerned they may be vulnerable to detention following the departure of senior management according to interviews with employees and family members
the arrested chevron workers oversaw operations and procurement at petropiar an oil production and processing project by pdvsa and chevron
chevron has asked employees assigned to petropiar to temporarily work from the firm s puerto la cruz office rather than show up at its partner s oil production and processing facilities according to one person familiar with the situation
the two men had refused to sign a dollar contract under an emergency decree to buy imported parts required by petropiar according to six sources with knowledge of the contract dispute
such decrees which skip competitive bidding have been cited by venezuelan and prosecutors as a means of extracting bribes in some recent corruption cases
algarra and vasquez are now being held in a detention centre in barcelona run by venezuela s intelligence unit known as sebin
coworkers and relatives have brought them food to supplement what they are provided a person familiar with the matter said
several other foreign energy companies have written down the value of their venezuela assets by hundreds of millions of dollars or halted most operations keeping only a skeletal staff in the country
spain s repsol took a charge of about billion on its venezuelan assets in the prior quarter
italy s eni said it was owed million euros million in delinquent payments from pdvsa last year
service provider schlumberger wrote down its venezuelan holdings in the fourth quarter by million
halliburton earlier this month said it wrote off all remaining assets in the country adding a million charge on top of million in charges last year
other international oil firms including france s total sa have withdrawn foreign staff in recent years and reduced investment as living conditions have deteriorated
i can tell you it is difficult for our people because of lack of power lack of water said chief executive patrick pouyanne last week at an oil summit in paris
the company would maintain a presence there however on the hope the crisis would ease
it is important to stay in a country even in difficult times pouyanne said because people will remember reporting by marianna parraga and alexandra ulmer and ernest scheyder editing by gary mcwilliams simon webb and brian thevenot
