expectations of soaring demand for cobalt because of its use in electric vehicles has inspired a hunt for the mineral across the globe
governments and miners are anxious to secure supplies in more stable jurisdictions than democratic republic of congo which holds around half of the world s reserves
first cobalt wants to develop and canadian resources which are smaller but close to including the car industry
frank santaguida first cobalt s vice president for exploration said on the sidelines of a canadian mining conference in london the company was absolutely working on more deals
a pipeline of projects is what s necessary to really move forward and to continually assess the best things to develop he said

it s about having prospects to look the world s major cobalt producing companies are led by glencore and china molybdenum operating in democratic republic of congo
north america mined cobalt in the past but no company is currently producing there

santaguida said that should be by the end of may
the deal adds cobalt s exploration properties in idaho and utah to first cobalt s mining properties in cobalt ontario which include a permitted cobalt refinery
