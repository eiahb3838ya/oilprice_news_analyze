analysis -indonesian president turns to populist policies ahead of tough 2019 election
jakarta reuters soon after taking office in indonesian president joko widodo made a landmark decision to cut subsidies on politically sensitive fuel prices to boost the economy but a year out from a tough campaign his reformist zeal may be waning
markets cheered widodo s gamble to free up billions of dollars to build infrastructure while the former furniture salesman also unveiled a series of reforms to slash regulations holding back southeast asia s biggest economy
now less than a year from an expected election widodo has made a strategic policy shift say senior government officials dropping nearly billion of infrastructure projects to focus on social welfare
the government has also slapped price controls on staple goods such as fuel power rice and sugar moves that will surely be welcomed by voters
of course he s thinking about elections
with these moves he can gain popularity by benefiting the people and ensuring welfare both in the and said one senior official who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak on the issue
economists warn widodo s return to populist policies may threaten indonesia s investment climate
with national elections around the corner widodo appears to be backtracking on his reform agenda with a string of populist measures moves that would pressure firms profit margins and weigh on the investment climate fitch group s bmi research said in a note last week
widodo took office promising to boost annual economic growth to percent and with an ambitious plan to build billion worth of infrastructure across the poorly connected archipelago
indonesia has since earned coveted upgrades from ratings agencies
standard poor s last year announced a landmark upgrade for indonesia to investment grade status
this month moody s investors services raised its ratings another notch citing effective policies to support broad economic stability
indonesia has also jumped places to in the world bank s ease of doing business index
the old widodo still enjoys high public approval with recent surveys giving him a double digit lead over his main rival former general prabowo subianto
widodo only narrowly defeated subianto in a bitterly fought election
subianto is expected to campaign on welfare issues the cost of living and a perceived on chinese investment at a time when economic growth is stagnating at around percent and consumption has been persistently sluggish
asked about the government s change in policy focus widodo s said it was time to be realistic
development should not just be in the physical sector but also be oriented to the sector like vocational schools education religious schools health moeldoko a former military commander said in an interview with reuters
the president is aware that we are achieving some success in the investment area in infrastructure in ease of doing business and in deregulation so we can leap to the next stage which is to focus on human development he told reuters
data shows that as of the end of around billion worth of roads ports bridges and dams had been built or were under construction
but experts say it s unlikely the remainder of the programme can be finished before the end of widodo s term in oct
denni purbasari the president s deputy for economic affairs said the government had taken into account external factors like rising global oil prices in its decision to funds to public welfare
it s important to balance between economic progress and the burden borne by the people
we percent believe that an adjustment must be made to fuel subsidies said purbasari
motorcycle taxi driver ibrahim naben believes widodo s new policies can only boost the president s support base
jokowi has been fair and has a record of policies that help the poor even in the most remote islands naben said using the president s nickname
we re not feeling the effects yet but we anticipate any price controls will be good for widodo plans to keep electricity tariffs and fuel prices unchanged over the next two years by hiking subsidies by million in and making state owned enterprises soes foot the rest of the bill
critics say the move is a reversal of the decision to scrap fuel subsidies and that the government is essentially forcing soes to subsidise prices
moody s has said it could undo its recent upgrade of indonesia s government debt if the financial health of soes worsened and threatened the government s balance sheet
the finance ministry has said it will monitor such risks
another plan to force fuel retailers to get government approval before changing prices has been criticised as distorting the market
other efforts to boost purchasing power include imposing a ceiling price on rice even though traders say the upcoming main harvest of the staple should contain prices
government officials insist the policy changes will not affect the core discipline of widodo s economic agenda
finance minister sri mulyani indrawati recently told foreign correspondents the government was not returning to subsidising everything and was not curtailing market mechanisms
this year s budget deficit would be under percent of gross domestic product well below a legal cap of percent she said
arianto patunru a researcher on indonesia s economy at australian national university said widodo s actions should be seen in the context of a global shift towards populist policies
if the indonesian government is carried away with this trend i think the prospect is not so bright he said adding it was too early to say if it was a risk to economic reforms in the southeast asian nation
