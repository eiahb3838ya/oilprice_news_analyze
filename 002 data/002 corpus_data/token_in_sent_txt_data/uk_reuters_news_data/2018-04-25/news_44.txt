in power for 15 years, iraq's shi'ites split ahead of crucial vote
iraq reuters united in their fight against saddam hussein s oppression for decades iraq s shi ites have become deeply fragmented and disillusioned with their leaders after years in power
in iraq s shi ite heartlands many who once voted blindly along sectarian lines are now turning their ire against the shi governments they say have failed to repair crumbling infrastructure provide jobs or end the violence
the divisions within the community now risk splitting the shi ite vote in a may election which could complicate and delay the formation of a government threaten gains against islamic state and let iran meddle further in iraq s politics
in the southern province of basra retired teacher mowafaq abdul ghani is disappointed with the performance of the shi ite leaders since saddam fell in
i ve been waiting for saddam to fall since the
i ve been waiting for you
why would you do this to us he said
look around
the streets are filthy there are flies everywhere pot holes at every step
twenty years ago basra was terrible but it was better than this abdul ghani said
in the holy city of najaf home to imam ali s shrine and iraq s most revered shi ite cleric grand ayatollah ali there was a similar feeling of disillusionment
at midnight on april when official campaigning began hordes of party activists plastered campaign posters on every visible surface in same cases covering pictures honouring those who died fighting islamic state
they took down the martyrs and replaced them with thieves said unemployed abbas saad
even sistani seems unhappy with the performance of the politicians issuing a fatwa recently implicitly calling on shi ites to vote for new blood
the tried should not be tried said the fatwa from sistani whose decrees are sacrosanct to millions
under the informal arrangement in place since saddam s fall the prime minister has always come from the shi ite majority with a kurdish president and a sunni speaker
in the past while no party has won enough seats to govern alone there has typically been one shi ite leader with enough support to shape a ruling coalition government
this time there are three shi ite frontrunners incumbent haider who has promoted a more inclusive government his overtly sectarian predecessor nuri who failed to inspire unity and hadi a military commander close to iran s powerful revolutionary guards seen as a war hero by many
if no clear winner emerges iran could have more of a chance to act as a broker between the shi ite parties and influence who becomes prime minister while islamic state could capitalise on any power vacuum and exploit sunni feelings of marginalisation
at a party for university graduates in najaf dozens of young people danced under a glittering disco ball and listened to poetry in a packed hall
at the event sponsored by adnan a former governor running on abadi s victory alliance list the talk was of inclusiveness
about percent of iraqis are or younger and many young people in urban areas say they want a secular government underscoring the split within the shi ite voter base
i m against voting based on sect said student ali reda
abadi s list touted by zurfi as is the only one contesting the election in all of iraq s provinces
the youth care about unemployment education and freedoms he said at a nearby cafe surrounded by young men playing billiards
the shi ite majority has a responsibility to calm the fears of other communities
we are proposing an inclusive government in which everyone is just an hour away from najaf in karbala the holy city visited by million shi ite pilgrims a year sharing power with sunnis and kurds is not seen as a solution
iraq has a shi ite majority
it is natural that it be ruled by a shi ite said muntazer who runs a school for shi ite clerics
while there has been no census for a long time figures from put the breakdown of the iraqi population at roughly percent shi ite arabs percent sunni arabs percent kurds with other groups making up the rest
shahrestani said while the rights of minorities should be protected there should be a shi ite government echoing a popular opinion among religious shi ites
many campaign on that sentiment none more than former prime minister maliki who is widely viewed by sunni and kurds as sectarian and oppressive
maliki is also blamed by many shi ites for losing a third of iraq to islamic state in before being replaced by abadi but he remains popular with others who credit him with signing saddam s death warrant
in hayaniya one of the poorest parts of basra ali khaled plans to vote for amiri s conquest alliance as do many in his neighbourhood
khaled s brother was killed fighting islamic state for amiri s badr organisation an militia that is one of the many groups collectively known as the popular mobilisation forces pmf that emerged as a response to a sistani fatwa calling on iraqis to fight islamic state
he receives up to a month as payment for the death of his brother but he s not thanking the current government
the pmf follow god they don t have bureaucracy like the government khaled said
hadi fought with us
he left his cushy post as a minister to fight for us
he eats our food
he lived with but many others view amiri whose candidates hang photos of iranian supreme leaders ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and ayatollah ali khamenei in their offices as having a stronger allegiance to iran than iraq
amiri is a hero but he is too close to iran
a vote for him is one against iraq s sovereignty said abdul ghani the retired teacher in basra
for years the province was a support base for shi ite leaders
now many basrawis are fed up
basra produces about million barrels of oil per day the vast majority of iraq s oil wealth equivalent to more than percent of the federal budget
but many in the city don t believe they get a fair share of government revenues handed out to the provinces and say what little they do get is squandered by local officials
the city s water is undrinkable its roads neglected and its streets overflowing with waste
the river that divides the city was once a source of prosperity for its people but now its clogged with rubbish
jobs are scant as are school supplies and medical equipment but there is no shortage of posters for the shi ite candidates
at the same house in hayaniya where khaled was speaking his neighbour a soldier with an elite interior ministry unit said he would just not vote even for abadi his
many do still plan to vote for abadi though more out of pragmatism than passion with some describing him as the best of the worst
wounded fighting islamic state in mosul last year the soldier who requested anonymity sipped tea sitting on the floor his leg still in a cast he was forced to pay for himself
when i was first injured i got visits and promises from officials but nothing ultimately
i have no faith in the government or parliament he said
a majority of those interviewed by reuters in basra said they would not vote
two men who declined to be named said they planned to sell their families votes to the highest bidder just to help make ends meet
i am hungry
i have eight votes and i want to sell them said one
