bosch seeks to restore diesel reputation with new staff rules,  technology
frankfurt april reuters german auto supplier robert bosch announced on wednesday a new code of conduct for staff and improved exhaust control technology as it strives to draw a line under an emissions scandal that has tarnished the diesel car industry
prosecutors in stuttgart are probing several car brands and supplier bosch for their suspected roles in using an engine control unit to cheat exhaust emissions tests
volkswagen used the unit in its diesel engine which was found in to artificially throttle back pollution levels during a regulatory test cycle triggering a global crackdown on carmakers and toxic pollution
earlier this month prosecutors seized an unknown number of files at volkswagen s sportscar brands porsche and audi
chief financial officer stefan asenkerschbaumer said on wednesday bosch had set aside billion euros billion to cover potential risks stemming from antitrust probes and an investigation into diesel emissions cheating
that is up slightly from the billion euros announced last year
the auto supplier also said it would teach staff a new code of conduct for developers by the end of this year in an effort to change the mindset of the company
as part of the new rules it will be forbidden to permit the installation of functions that automatically help a vehicle recognise when it is being subjected to an emissions test and bosch products are not allowed to be tweaked to help a manufacturer pass a test the company said
we view the principles as a way to guide and motivate our engineers bosch said
using software some volkswagen cars could detect when they were being subjected to an emissions test and increase the effectiveness of exhaust filtering systems to temporarily keep emissions within legal limits
bosch has said manufacturers not suppliers are legally responsible for ensuring vehicles obtain road certification by legal means
it has said it takes allegations of engine manipulation very seriously and is fully cooperating with authorities
bosch also said on wednesday it had developed a new exhaust emissions treatment technology that cuts pollution from nitrogen oxides nox to milligrams per kilometre well below the current legal limit of milligrams
the new system costs roughly the same as a sophisticated exhaust filter system included in diesel vehicles bosch said
this breakthrough offers the opportunity to shift the heated debate over diesel into new territory and hopefully bring it to a electric cars will not become a mass market phenomenon until at least bosch said
until electromobility breaks through to the mass market we will still need these highly efficient combustion engines bosch chief executive volkmar denner said
