subsea 7 says could change offer if mcdermott cooperates
oslo reuters norwegian offshore oil services firm subsea is open to potentially sweetening its billion billion pounds offer for mcdermott if the company would work with it to identify additional benefits of a deal subsea said on wednesday
the norwegian firm s comments come a week before mcdermott s shareholders vote on a planned combination with chicago bridge and iron cb i which mcdermott s board has recommended its investors to support while rejected subsea s proposal subsea is open to considering amending its proposal if it can discover additional value through discussions with the mcdermott management team subsea one fifth owned by norwegian billionaire kristian siem said in a statement
siem who is also subsea s chairman declined to say specifically whether the company was willing to pay more than the per share rejected by mcdermott s board on april
some analysts say that depending on potential synergies subsea could increase its offer to a least a share but it can t do that without more information from mcdermott
subsea repeated on wednesday its proposal was subject to the termination of mcdermott s planned transaction with cb i
italian oil services group saipem which competes with subsea in providing undersea solutions for oil and gas firms has said the bid for mcdermott is a sign of industry consolidation that has to be monitored closely
the move comes after schlumberger and subsea started talks earlier this year to form a joint venture to deliver undersea installations and services
oil firms have returned to profit thanks to higher oil prices and cost cuts made in the recent downturn but their suppliers are still feeling the squeeze
siem has long called for the industry to consolidate as a way of coping
siem doesn t care about the market share but about the value
he wouldn t do that buy mcdermott if it would not create value for shareholders said analyst frederik lunde at carnegie
