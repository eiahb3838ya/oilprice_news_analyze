south sudan president rejects opposition calls to quit post
juba reuters south sudan president salva kiir has rejected opposition calls for him to resign as part of efforts to end a civil war accusing groups of making unreasonable demands in peace talks
despite several agreements and ceasefires fighting has rumbled on in south sudan with barely any break since it first erupted in just two years after independence killing tens of thousands
in talks in the ethiopian capital addis ababa led by east african bloc igad opposition groups last month demanded kiir step aside
they also want a transitional parliament dissolved and replaced by a new one formed with less than members
the people who are fighting with us have unreasonable conditions to make peace kiir said during a ceremony for his deceased army chief general james ajongo mawut late on tuesday
they think that i am the obstacle to peace and if i am removed after signing the agreement then there will be no problem he added
they want me to sign the agreement and then step down immediately
just imagine what is my incentive in bringing peace if it is peace that i will bring and then i step aside
nobody can do it
bashir sudanese president omar didn t do it when we are fighting with the government and rebel groups signed the latest ceasefire in december in addis ababa aiming to revive a pact reached in
but the truce was violated within hours
another series of talks that were scheduled for this week were postponed and are now expected to take place in early may
civil war first erupted when troops loyal to kiir clashed with forces loyal to riek machar then the vice president
tens of thousands of people have been killed and much of the nation has faced dire food shortages
igad said last month machar should be released from house arrest in south africa as soon as possible on condition that he renounces violence
the fighting has slashed oil production and driven about a third of the population of million from their homes
the refugee agency estimates million will be refugees in neighbouring countries by the end of this year
kiir also dismissed calls to dissolve the parliament
if we were to sign an agreement the agreement has to be endorsed by the parliament so that it is passed into law
if the parliament is dissolved then what do we do with the agreement he said
