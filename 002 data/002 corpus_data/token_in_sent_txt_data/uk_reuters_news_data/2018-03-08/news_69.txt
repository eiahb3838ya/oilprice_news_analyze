update 2-china feb exports surge most in 3 years as global trade war fears build
beijing reuters china s exports unexpectedly surged at the fastest pace in three years in february suggesting both its economy and global growth remain resilient even as trade relations with the united states rapidly deteriorate
trade tensions have jumped to the top of the list of risks facing china this year with planned tariffs on steel and aluminum signaling more measures may be on the way zhou hao senior emerging markets economist at commerzbank told the reuters global markets forum this week
china s february exports rose percent from a year earlier far more than analysts median forecast for a percent increase and january s percent gain official data showed on thursday
imports grew percent missing forecasts for percent growth and down from a percent jump in january
graphic analysts caution that chinese data early in the year can be heavily distorted by the timing of the lunar new year holiday which fell in february this year but in january in
but combined data also showed a dramatic acceleration in export growth good news for beijing as it tries to crack down on risks in the financial system without sharply braking economic activity
exports rose percent in eclipsing percent in december and up from growth in the same period last year
the gains came despite a much stronger yuan currency which is worrying the country s exporters
the recovery in china s major export markets could explain part of the reason why exports were still quite strong said betty wang senior china economist at anz in hong kong
but tension with the is definitely a concern and a downside risk to china s trade outlook she added
china s goods surplus with the united states a sore spot in relations between the two nations narrowed slightly last month but is higher so far this year than at the same point last year
china s trade surplus with the was billion in february compared with billion in january
boosted by a global trade boom china s exports last year grew the fastest since and served as one of the key drivers behind the economy s percent expansion
but tough trade talk last year is now turning into action clouding the outlook for a repeat performance
president donald trump is expected to sign a proclamation on thursday or friday to establish the steel and aluminum tariffs to counter cheap imports especially from china though close allies may get exemptions
the measures are expected to go into effect in about two weeks but economists see little immediate impact on china
china has already reduced steel exports to the to a trickle in response to strong demand at home and duties and while aluminum shipments account for around percent of its global exports of the metal the number is still small compared with china s total exports according to ing economist iris pang
all in all the direct impact on china is minimal pang said in a note published on thursday
while china s global steel exports have dropped by almost a third this year tariffs on aluminum may be an easier sell for trump as china s shipments increased over percent in the first two months of the year
over time however any additional punitive measures and retaliations by china or its other major trading partners would reduce global trade flows disrupt international supply chains and drag on global growth
china may be far more vulnerable to plans to combat intellectual property theft which could hit its sales of products
china s global tech exports saw strong gains in the first two months of this year
foreign minister wang yi said on thursday that china would make a necessary response in the event of a trade war with the but said such a war would only harm all sides
on paper china has more to lose from a trade war it exports far more to the than it imports capital economics said
but for the there are few alternative sources for the main products that it buys from china such as mobile phones tablets and network equipment it added
at home china s domestic demand also appears solid despite a cooling property market and rising borrowing costs that are expected to eventually rob the economy of some momentum
while february import growth softened it climbed percent in the first two months of the year compared with percent in december
imports of commodities again led the way with steel mills replenishing inventories of iron ore ahead of the seasonal construction in spring
china s trade surplus widened to billion for february outperforming forecasts for million and january s billion
for combined the surplus rose percent from the year earlier period to billion
the strong trade performance suggests a possible upside surprise in china s industrial output data next week and in economic growth for the first quarter as a whole
analysts polled by reuters earlier this year expected momentum to ease slightly to percent this quarter from percent late last year
premier li keqiang said monday that china aims to expand its economy by around percent in the same target that it beat handily in
