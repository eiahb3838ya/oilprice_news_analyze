tepco's "ice wall" fails to freeze fukushima's toxic water buildup
okuma japan reuters a costly ice wall is failing to keep groundwater from seeping into the stricken fukushima nuclear plant data from operator tokyo electric power co shows preventing it from removing radioactive melted fuel at the site seven years after the disaster
when the ice wall was announced in tepco assured sceptics that it would limit the flow of groundwater into the plant s basements where it mixes with highly radioactive debris from the site s reactors to nearly however since the ice wall became fully operational at the end of august an average of metric tonnes a day of water has seeped into the reactor and turbine areas more than the average of metric tonnes a day during the prior nine months a reuters analysis of the tepco data showed
the groundwater seepage has delayed tepco s at the site and may undermine the entire decommissioning process for the plant which was battered by a tsunami seven years ago this sunday
waves knocked out power and triggered meltdowns at three of the site s six reactors that spewed radiation forcing residents to flee many of whom have not returned to this coast
though called an ice wall tepco has attempted to create something more like a frozen soil barrier
using billion yen million in public funds tepco sunk about tubes filled with brine to a depth of metres feet in a perimeter around four of the plant s reactors
it then cools the brine to minus degrees celsius minus fahrenheit
the aim is to freeze the soil into a solid mass that blocks groundwater flowing from the hills west of the plant to the coast
however the continuing seepage has created vast amounts of toxic water that tepco must pump out decontaminate and store in tanks at fukushima that now number holding million tonnes
it says it will run out of space by early
i believe the ice wall was oversold in that it would solve all the release and storage concerns said dale klein the former chairman of the nuclear regulatory commission and the head of an external committee advising tepco on safety issues
the hydrology of the fukushima site is very complicated and thus the exact water flow is hard to predict he said especially during heavy graphic water seepage flows at fukushima the water inflows often fluctuate with rainfall
the dry month of january averaged tons a day tepco data showed
but when a typhoon struck during the last week of october tons a day poured into the reactors
overall tepco says a combination of drains pumps and the ice wall has cut water flows by from tons a day during the december to february period to an average of tons a day for december to february
it is hard to measure exactly how much the ice wall is contributing tepco officials say but based on computer analysis the utility estimates the barrier is reducing water flows by about tonnes a day compared to two years ago before the barrier was operating
our assessment is that the ice wall has been effective said naohiro masuda tepco s chief decommissioning officer adding that rain falling within the ice wall perimeter contributed to surging volumes
we now believe we have a system in place to manage the water however a panel on wednesday offered a mixed assessment of the ice wall saying it was partially effective but more steps were needed
controlling the groundwater seepage using the ice wall has been central to japan s program to show it had the fukushima decommissioning in hand
the barrier was announced just days before tokyo won the bid to host the summer olympics and prime minister shinzo abe declared that fukushima was under control in his final pitch to the international olympic committee
in addition to the building costs the ice wall needs an estimated million kilowatt hours of electricity a year to run enough to power about typical japanese homes

the purification process removes radioactive elements from the contaminated water but it leaves tritium a mildly radioactive element that is difficult to separate from water
not considered harmful in low doses tritium is released into oceans and rivers by nuclear plants around the world at various national standard levels
but local residents particularly fishermen oppose ocean releases because they fear it will keep consumers from buying fukushima products
many countries including south korea and china still have restrictions on produce from fukushima and neighbouring areas
a task force is examining five options for disposing of the water including ocean releases though no decision has been made
ken buesseler a radiochemist at the woods hole oceanographic institution in the united states suggests that tepco should open the tanks to external inspections to see if the water is safe
from the public s viewpoint i think they d want a bit of independent confirmation buesseler said
it s no harder and a lot cheaper than building an ice reporting by malcolm foster and aaron sheldrick editing by christian schmollinger
