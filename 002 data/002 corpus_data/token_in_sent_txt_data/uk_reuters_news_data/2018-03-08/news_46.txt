unifil says "no appetite" for war as lebanon, israel talk about border dispute
naqoura lebanon march reuters lebanon and israel have been holding talks nearly every day over a border dispute that has raised tensions between the two enemy states according to the peacekeeping force on the frontier that is mediating their discussions
there is a full engagement from all the sides and there have been meetings almost on a daily basis
the dialogue is open
no one has ever walked out from these meetings said andrea tenenti spokesman for the united nations interim force in lebanon unifil
tensions have spiked recently over an israeli border wall lebanese offshore energy exploration and the growing arsenal of lebanon s hezbollah group which israel sees as the biggest threat on its frontier
lebanon israel and unifil were already holding talks every few weeks in a building on the border near the peacekeepers base at naqoura in southern lebanon
they are now being held more often tenenti said along with indirect talks conducted through unifil
israel is building a border wall near the blue line as the frontier demarcation between the two countries in lieu of a formal border agreement is known
lebanon has described the wall as an aggression saying it intrudes into lebanese territory
israel says the wall will be entirely on its side of the blue line and in israeli territory
at the same time lebanon has begun oil and gas exploration in a block that includes a small area of sea along the maritime frontier that is claimed by israel
there is a will to keep this dialogue open
i think now beside the heightened rhetoric the reality on the ground is different and there is no appetite for instability or for war tenenti said
reuters footage from a recent trip to the border area showed construction work in areas along the blue line including cranes erecting concrete blocks and bulldozers working at a fence
israel occupied southern lebanon from to and in it waged a war against hezbollah there
israel says the shi ite muslim group has grown stronger due to its role in the syrian civil war and has attacked it there
the last years have seen the quietest period the south of lebanon has witnessed in over years tenenti said
but it is important to keep in mind that things along the blue line are in general very sensitive
anything could if it is not addressed immediately potentially spark into something bigger and increase for abu moussa taher a shop owner in naqoura the idea of a new war seems distant
it is impossible i think
when you think of a war you have to think of its consequences said taher who says he has witnessed all of the wars to hit the area since
