eu gives poland two months to address gas storage violations
warsaw reuters poland s law on natural gas storage violates the european union s rules on security of gas supplies the eu s executive said on thursday giving warsaw two months to address its concerns
poland amended a bill on obligatory oil and gas reserves in the summer of to set conditions requiring private gas companies that want to import gas to maintain some reserves
under the bill gas importers with inventories abroad will have to book transmission capacity at links to be able to send gas to poland in case of emergency
the conditions to fulfil the obligation by storing gas abroad in practice make such storage less attractive and more cumbersome than storing in poland the european commission said in a statement
the commission is of the view that the polish gas storage obligation is incompatible with the eu measures to safeguard the security of gas poland once viewed as a champion of democratic change after the fall of communism has been locked in disputes with brussels since the ruling nationalist law and justice pis party came to power in over issues ranging from immigration and environment to the country s rule of law
poland s energy ministry played down the commission s concerns saying they were part of a routine analysis of compliance of national laws with eu regulations
the minister of energy positively assesses the functioning of the current system of security of supplies the ministry said in a statement on its website the recent law changes have positively affected the level of energy some smaller polish players in the gas market have criticised the bill saying it is unfair and will result in gas prices rising in poland
should poland fail to address the eu concerns the commission may decide to send a reasoned opinion which would take the infringement procedures further and could end in referring the case to the european court of justice
