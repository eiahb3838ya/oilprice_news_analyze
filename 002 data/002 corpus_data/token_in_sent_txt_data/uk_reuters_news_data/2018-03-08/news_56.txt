rpt-column-ignore february weakness, china's commodity imports are robust: russell

the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
by clyde russell launceston australia march reuters it s safe to dismiss any impression that china s imports of major commodities such as crude oil and iron ore were weak in february despite the numbers suggesting as much
the timing of the lunar new year holiday usually affects when imports are counted as having arrived in the world s largest buyer of commodities
this year the holiday fell entirely in february likely resulting in a of the counting of imports into january meaning february s arrivals appear weaker than they should
crude oil imports in february were million tonnes china customs said on thursday equivalent to about million barrels per day bpd
that looks like a massive drop from january s million bpd which was the strongest month on record
putting the first two months of together however gives an import rate of about million bpd up a fairly strong percent from the same period last year
it s a similar story for iron ore with february imports plunging percent to million tonnes from january s million which was the month on record
again taking the first two months together gives an import total of million tonnes up percent on the same period last year
and port data compiled by thomson reuters tends to be less lumpy than the official customs data with the numbers showing january arrivals of million tonnes of iron ore and february pegged at million giving a total of million
the shipping data doesn t exactly align with customs data as it doesn t include any iron ore china imports that come overland such as from neighbouring mongolia
coal imports were another area of strength in the first two months of rising percent from the same period a year ago to million tonnes despite on the surface looking weak after they dropped percent in february from january
imports of unwrought copper also dropped in february falling percent from january to tonnes
similar to other major commodities though the copper imports were quite robust on a basis having increased by percent in the period this year compared to the same period in
the conclusion can only be that china s appetite for imported commodities remains robust and consistent with the current narrative of an economy that is performing fairly well notwithstanding areas of concern such as credit quality
a further sign of this is steel product exports one of the few areas of genuine weakness in the chinese commodity complex
steel product exports are down percent to million tonnes in the first two months of the year compared to the same period a year ago
this is largely a reflection of a tighter domestic market in the wake of enforced closures of some blast furnaces over winter as part of measures to reduce air pollution
but it also shows that domestic steel prices are high enough to keep what is being produced within the local market
china s steel exports have been trending lower in recent months having slumped percent in
this fact sits somewhat uncomfortably with president donald trump s planned new percent tariff on imports with china s exports cited by his administration as one of the reasons behind the decision
trump is on somewhat safer ground with his planned percent import tariff on aluminium given china s exports of unwrought aluminium and products have surged percent to tonnes in the first two months of from the same period last year
