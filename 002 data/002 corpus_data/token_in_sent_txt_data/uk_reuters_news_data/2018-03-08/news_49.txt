the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london march reuters despite the overwhelmingly bullish sentiment that still dominates talk about oil prices the rally that started at the end of june seems to have run out of momentum
brent futures prices peaked in the final week of january and have since been on a gently declining trend
brent calendar spreads peaked even earlier in january and have also been gently softening for nearly two months now
prices and spreads are back to levels they first reached in the middle of december ensuring there has been no real increase for three months
hedge funds and other money managers remain overwhelmingly bullish with a net long position in futures and options linked to brent equivalent to million barrels
hedge fund long positions in brent outnumber short ones by a ratio of more than suggesting most portfolio managers still believe prices will rise further in the short term
but the net position also peaked in late january and has been slowly slipping since then according to exchange data
gross long positions have declined from a record million barrels on to million barrels on
hedge fund managers have been quietly liquidating some of their bullish long positions as prices have stopped rising
in the oil market actions speak louder than words and fund managers have turned more cautious over the last six weeks
the critical question is whether this is merely a pause and the rally will resume shortly or whether it marks a peak at least temporarily
brent prices have averaged just over per barrel so far in which is not far from the forecast of predicted by energy professionals in a survey at the start of the year
recent news flow has been mixed with oil consumption rising strongly but production forecasts also being revised sharply higher
opec leaders have reiterated their commitment to curb output throughout this year and seem to be preparing to toughen their inventory target
the organisation s members led by saudi arabia appear to be informally targeting a price level above per barrel in
but oil and liquids production is now forecast to grow by million barrels per day bpd this year an enormous upward revision from the million bpd increase predicted in december
the energy information administration now forecasts total crude and liquids production will hit million bpd by the end of energy outlook eia march
the forecast has been revised repeatedly upwards from the million bpd predicted nine months ago when the rally started energy outlook eia june
in the circumstances it is not obvious the next move in oil prices will be higher in the near term and that caution has started to flow through into prices and fund manager positions
