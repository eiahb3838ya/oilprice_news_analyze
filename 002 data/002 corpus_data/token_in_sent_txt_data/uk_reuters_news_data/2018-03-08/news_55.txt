oil and corn tout dueling studies on future of u.s. biofuel program
new york reuters big oil and big corn are touting opposing studies released this week on proposed biofuels policy reforms under consideration by the trump administration part of an ongoing clash between the two sides over the future of the program
valero energy corp a major oil refiner funded a study by charles river associates that supports placing a cap on the price of biofuel blending credits under the renewable fuel standard rfs a change meant to help refiners that complain the rfs now costs them a fortune
a rival report from iowa state university also released this week said such a cap on credits would backfire by eroding demand for ethanol and potentially lowering corn prices already under pressure from a supply glut
the corn industry did not directly fund the iowa state study but does provide funding to the university
the studies are meant to inform the administration s deliberations on how and if to reform the rfs which has become a major point of tension between two of president donald trump s most important constituencies
the rfs requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels mainly ethanol into the fuel supply each year or buy the renewable fuel credits called rins from other companies that do the blending
the regulation was introduced during the administration of president george bush to help farmers cut petroleum imports and improve air quality
but a surge in the price of rins in recent years has upset merchant refiners who say the policy now costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year
trump waded deeply into the debate last week urging representatives of both sides to accept a compromise deal that caps prices for the credits while also removing seasonal limits on blend gasolines to expand the biofuels market
a cap would control costs for small refiners and help them stay afloat said brendan williams vice president of government relations for refining company pbf energy
the biofuels industry likes the idea of expanding blend gasoline sales but has pushed back on the idea of a cap
the rfs is a program said brooke coleman head of the advanced biofuels business council
part of the whole mechanism working is that the price of rins may go up and so you should go long on it s a strategy to kill the rfs and to kill the economic incentive to blend said coleman referring to a cap
trump has not pushed a particular price level for the proposed rin price cap but republican senator ted cruz of texas an advocate for the refining industry has called for a limit of cents per rin a fraction of their current value
the iowa state study said such a cap would translate to percent less ethanol blending in
and without an increase in exports that would mean a drop in corn prices too
the study on the other hand said a price cap could alleviate several of the most pressing issues with the rfs while also continuing to incentivize investment in ethanol blending
in january refiner philadelphia energy solutions blamed its bankruptcy on rins
bad deals and large investor payouts also played key roles in its collapse reuters reported
on wednesday biofuel manufacturers sent an open letter to trump urging him to protect the program
the letter came as a delegation of refinery workers held meetings with lawmakers urging changes to the rfs
