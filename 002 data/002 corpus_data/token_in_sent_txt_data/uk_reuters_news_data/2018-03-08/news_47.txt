update 1-n.ireland's dup leader sees no return to devolution for months
london reuters the leader of northern ireland s democratic unionist party dup arlene foster said on thursday she saw little chance of a return to devolved government in the british province in the coming weeks or months
the province has been without a devolved executive for over a year since irish nationalists sinn fein withdrew from the compulsory government with the dup their
the executive is central to a peace deal that ended three decades of violence
for this past months we have been unable to form a devolved government
i really regret that foster said in a speech to the british chambers of commerce in london
given everything that happened over the past couple of weeks i see little prospect of it being returned in the coming weeks or foster whose party supports prime minister theresa may s conservative government added that she was disappointed that a return to violence in northern ireland had been raised in brexit talks by those with little knowledge of the region
arrangements for the border between northern ireland and the irish republic are one of the thorniest issues of brexit talks
britain s government has said it does not want a customs union with the eu without which the eu says it would need to regulate northern ireland s trade to avoid a return of customs checks
a hard border is opposed by britain and ireland and northern irish political parties and some irish nationalists would see physical border infrastructure as an unwelcome symbol of british rule over northern ireland
some supporters of britain remaining in a close trading relationship with the european union have raised the spectre of a return to armed conflict between british loyalists and those seeking a united ireland if there is a hard border after brexit
i do object in the strongest terms to people who have limited experience of the troubles in northern ireland throwing threats of violence around as some kind of bargaining chip in the negotiating process foster said
to do so is an insult to the people of northern she said the eu draft proposals to protect the open border in ireland that would in effect keep the british province in a customs union with the bloc was an act of bad the commission s draft text is entirely unacceptable and actually represents an act of bad faith on the part of brussels towards addressing the challenges facing the border in a fair and sensible fashion she said
