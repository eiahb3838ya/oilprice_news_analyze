update 2-uniper ceo says takeover by fortum not a done deal
duesseldorf reuters an agreement for finland s fortum to buy a percent stake in german energy group uniper from could face intense scrutiny in russia uniper s chief executive klaus schaefer told journalists on thursday
fortum has committed to seek regulatory approval for the deal from relevant jurisdictions including russia by at the latest according to official offer documents
securing approval in russia where uniper operates several power plants could be challenging schaefer said pointing to a law that effectively prohibits foreign states or entities from gaining control over assets deemed as strategic
and that is the case for our activities schaefer said
this law has a high relevance and therefore you have to consider how such an approval could look like or a fortum spokeswoman said the finnish company had filed for merger approval in russia as well as approval under the russian strategic investment act and expects both applications to be s federal antimonopoly service in october voiced concern about the deal which would involve the purchase of more than percent of uniper s russian assets
fortum was offered only percent of uniper shares in a tender that expired in february on top of a percent stake it negotiated separately with after uniper s management advised shareholders not to tender their shares
uniper fought against the bid saying it was hostile and too low and that the combination would make little sense given its heavy exposure to gas and power plants while fortum s focus is on clean technologies
separately fortum said some of its own investors had complained the uniper deal would raise the company s carbon footprint and had also voiced scepticism over the involvement in building the nord stream pipeline for russian gas
many stakeholders such as sri socially responsible investors have contacted fortum to discuss the bid
the main concern has been the strategic fit of uniper s production with fortum assets it said
the company defended its plans however arguing conventional energy production was still needed to ensure affordable security of supply in europe
fortum acknowledges that not only the use of coal but also the origin of coal is a source of concern to some stakeholders uniper is much more than a coal company it said
while fortum supports a of power generated from coal this should be achieved within the european union s emissions trading scheme ets the company added
