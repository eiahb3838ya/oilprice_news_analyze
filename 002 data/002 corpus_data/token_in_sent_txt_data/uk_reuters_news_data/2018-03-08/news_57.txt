update 1-malaysia says eu palm oil curbs may undermine france's fighter jet bid
kuala lumpur reuters malaysia the world s producer of palm oil said on thursday the european union s decision to curb imports of the commodity could undermine france s hopes of winning one of asia s biggest fighter plane deals
france s rafale jet built by dassault aviation has been seen as the frontrunner in malaysia s plan to buy up to planes in a deal potentially worth more than billion
but talks hit a snag after eu lawmakers sought to stop the use of palm oil in motor fuels
malaysia said this week it would respond with might and tact if the eu did not back down on the curbs
the jet fighters the french are looking at the rafale are also competing with the brits who have left the eu
so they have to take that into consideration malaysian defence minister hishammuddin hussein told a news conference
malaysia has for several years been considering france s rafale jet and the eurofighter typhoon built by a european group that includes britain s bae systems to replace russian that are mostly grounded
bae has campaigned hard for almost a decade and has set up a regional office in kuala lumpur to press its bid
hishammuddin s comments may encourage bae whose bid seemed to lose traction after malaysian prime minister najib razak said he discussed a possible purchase of rafale planes during a visit in by france s francois hollande
dassault chief executive eric trappier said palm oil curbs could impact relations between several countries but said talks with malaysia had been going on for a long time
new talks will depend on the new government trappier told a news conference on the french firm s results
bae did not immediately respond to a request for comment
malaysia could lose about million in annual revenue if the eu goes ahead with palm oil curbs analysts estimate
it adds to troubles facing malaysia s prime minister najib whose ruling coalition will rely on votes from more than palm oil plantation smallholders in elections due by august
french government sources said france would not back a total ban
if it is sustainable palm oil then it could be used in biofuels a french official said
the idea is to support a constructive and approach of palm french defence minister florence parly said in comments reported by malaysia s new straits times in january that malaysia can rely on france for support against the ban
hishammuddin said malaysia can not put a price tag on its national interests when negotiating bilateral deals
he said those seeking strong bilateral ties should not just look at economic considerations separate from other considerations especially when it come to defense because we do have other a decision on the planes has been delayed due to the approaching election and a shift in malaysia s focus towards upgrading aerial surveillance capabilities
