malaysia says eu palm oil curbs could weigh on france in fighter jet deal
kuala lumpur reuters malaysia the world s producer of palm oil on thursday said the european union s decision to curb imports of the commodity could impact france s hopes of winning one of asia s biggest fighter jet deals
france s rafale jet built by dassault aviation had until recently been seen as the frontrunner in malaysia s plan to buy up to new fighter planes in a deal potentially worth over billion billion pounds but negotiations hit a snag after european lawmakers pushed to stop using palm oil in motor fuels
malaysia said earlier this week that it would not shy away from a trade war and that it would respond with might and tact if the eu does not back down on curbing palm imports
as you know the jet fighters the french are looking at the rafale are also competing with the brits who have left the eu
so they have to take that into consideration in relation to palm oil curbs malaysia s defence minister hishammuddin hussein said at a news conference outside parliament
britain s bae systems has been on a consistent and public campaign for nearly a decade now to win the malaysia contract even establishing a regional office in the capital kuala lumpur
hishammuddin s latest statement raises hopes for bae which looked to be on the backfoot after malaysian prime minister najib razak said that he had discussed the possible purchase of rafale fighters with francois hollande during the president s visit in march last year
both dassault and bae did not immediately respond to requests for comment
southeast asia s economy could lose some million in annual revenue if the eu goes ahead with its plan to crimp palm imports analysts have estimated
the move also adds to the troubles of prime minister najib whose ruling coalition will rely heavily on the votes of over palm oil plantation smallholders and their families in national polls that must be held by august
hishammuddin said malaysia can not put a price tag on the interests of the country and its people when negotiating bilateral deals
so to those who want to have strong bilateral relations with us do not just look at economic considerations separate from other considerations especially when it come to defence because we do have other options he said
malaysia has for several years been weighing france s rafale jet and the eurofighter typhoon built by a european consortium including bae as it looks to replace its russian most of which are grounded
however a decision has been delayed due to the upcoming national polls and a shift in malaysia s focus towards upgrading aerial surveillance capabilities
