eu and asset managers clash over "sustainable" investing plan
london reuters the european union has proposed making it a formal requirement for asset managers to consider sustainability when picking investments a move the eu s trillion euro trillion funds industry swiftly dismissed as a exercise
the eu wants more money going into sustainable and green projects that help cut greenhouse gas emissions as part of a wider capital markets union project to expand funding from financial markets for companies and growth
in an action plan published on thursday the european commission said it would clarify the duty of asset managers and big investors to ensure they take sustainability into account in the process of investing
the european fund and asset management association said it did not believe such legislation was needed because investment in sustainable projects had to be driven by the owners of the assets being invested
any mandatory sustainability requirement especially regarding investments would turn environmental social and governance into a tick the box compliance exercise efama said
pensionseurope which represents national pensions trade bodies said the eu s proposals needed to be flexible so as to avoid upsetting the role of trustees or social partners
pension funds main purpose will continue to be serving the best interests of their members and to delivering adequate pensions at low costs it said
the eu s proposal also includes plans for a checklist of what qualifies as a climate friendly and sustainable activities definitions which could be used for creating eu labels for green financial products
the commission will also look at how banks and insurers could benefit from lower capital charges if they invested in green projects
the commission has retreated from an initial plan to go ahead with implementing these reductions after opposition from an advisory panel and central bankers who were worried about a green bubble being created
markus ferber a member of the european parliament which will have final say on the proposals said the eu should focus on keeping alive the bloc s capital markets project given that britain the eu s biggest market is leaving
what we need is bold initiatives tackling obstacles in tax and insolvency law and measures that facilitate capital market financing by smaller companies ferber said
sustainable finance however is only a diversion from the fact that one of the commission s flagship projects is about to tank he said referring to slow progress with efforts to create a capital market that can provide financing for businesses
