toxic particle linked to diesel kills 6,000 a year in germany - agency
berlin reuters some early deaths linked to nitrogen oxides nox are recorded each year in germany the federal environmental agency said on thursday providing more evidence of the health hazards posed by the toxic particles mostly produced by diesel engines
the figure is likely to add pressure on carmakers and the government as they scramble to slow the demise of the diesel technology in which germany s car industry invested billions
the environmental agency uba also said that nox causes one million people to fall ill each year and that levels of the toxic particle are higher in cities than the limit set under air quality standards
the car industry has relied on diesel as a stopgap technology to boost efficiency meet emissions goals and buy time for a shift toward electric mobility
but sales of diesel cars have been falling since volkswagen admitted in to cheating on emissions tests
subsequent studies have exposed the true levels of nox which is emitted more abundantly by diesel vehicles than petrol engines
a german court ruled last month that german cities can ban the most heavily polluting diesel cars from their streets a decision that could accelerate the demise of the combustion engine
