update 2-angola to launch big oil block under shadow of opec cuts
adds details on timeline outlook by libby george london march reuters the first vessel that will pump and store oil for angola s barrels per day bpd kaombo project is en route to the west african nation operator total said
the kaombo oil block will produce its first oil this summer total said on thursday
once it is fully up and running it will add roughly percent to the opec member s average output of million bpd
the kaombo norte floating production storage and offloading fpso vessel left singapore earlier this week total said
it can pump bpd half the oil block s eventual production
the billion offshore project will add a significant amount of oil to africa s number two exporter at a time when it is bound by output limits under a deal orchestrated by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
a source close to the project said the block was expected to pump roughly bpd by august
another fpso kaombo sul is still in singapore
opec is reducing output by roughly million bpd as part of a deal with russia and other producers that began in january and was extended until the end of
so far angola has complied comfortably pumping even less than the maximum agreed
last month its output of million bpd amounted to percent of compliance with promised cuts of bpd
declining production at mature fields has cut into angola s output but the kaombo addition could complicate efforts to maintain compliance
angola s state oil company sonangol has said production will be roughly steady this year and the cuts earlier in the year could keep its average compliance for the year within opec s limits
longer term angola is expected to struggle just to maintain output with the international energy agency iea warning that only venezuela will see a bigger drop in production over the next five years
angola s oil production peaked at million bpd in the iea said warning in its outlook that capacity will drop by some bpd by even with the new projects
angola is expected to post the biggest slide in capacity after venezuela as ageing oil fields lose steam and foreign investors faced with relatively uncompetitive prospects lose enthusiasm the iea said
