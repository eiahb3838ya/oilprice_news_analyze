coffman also said motiva was evaluating boosting the bpd port arthur refinery s capacity to million or million bpd which would make it the largest in the world
the aromatics unit for which honeywell uop s technology is being considered under one of the mous would convert benzene and paraxylene byproducts of gasoline production into million tons annually of feedstocks for chemicals and plastics
