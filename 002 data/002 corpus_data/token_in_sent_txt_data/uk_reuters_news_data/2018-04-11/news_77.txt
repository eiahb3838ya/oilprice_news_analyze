shipping fuel costs to spike 25 pct in 2020 on sulphur cap -woodmac
london reuters global shipping fuel costs are likely to rise by a quarter or billion in when new rules limiting sulfur kick in consultants wood mackenzie said on wednesday
the ballooning costs will come as the change in regulations forces a portion of the world s fleet to switch to lower sulfur but higher cost fuels such as marine gasoil mgo and ultra low sulfur fuel oil
the international maritime organization s imo rules targeting air pollution will cut the maximum amount of sulfur emissions that ships worldwide can burn to percent of fuel content by from percent currently
ships that install scrubbers can continue to burn cheaper high sulfur fuel oil but the bulk will not install these in time for the shift in
switching to mgo is a more costly solution and in full compliance would probably see freight rates increase perhaps by around a barrel said wood mackenzie senior research analyst iain mowat
wood mackenzie said its base case for cost increases is billion in compared with a total global shipping fuel bill of roughly billion today
however if no vessels added scrubbers and all ships complied with the rules the spike could be as high as billion
the rule change marks a seismic shift for the shipping and refining sectors
the imo is meeting in london this week to hash out further details on how it will implement the rules and ensure compliance
mowat said that while shippers could expect a percent return on investment cost for installing scrubbers the penetration rate for them would be limited by factors including limited access to finance scrubber manufacturing capacity and space
wood mackenzie estimates just percent of the global fleet will have scrubbers by
as a result wood mackenzie said the world s refiners need to gear up to churn out the lower sulfur fuels that vessels will need and even the primary spots for refueling ships could shift based on where lower sulfur fuels are available
singapore for example could potentially lose some of its market share for bunker fuels to china as shippers look for alternative locations with a surplus of compliant fuels mowat said
china with ample mgo supply is well positioned to attract reporting by libby george editing by susan fenton
