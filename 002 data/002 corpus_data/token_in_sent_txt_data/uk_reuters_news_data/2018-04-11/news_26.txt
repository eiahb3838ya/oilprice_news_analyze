ghana to launch first exploration licensing round in q4 2018 - minister
new delhi april reuters ghana will launch its first exploration licensing round in the last quarter of this year offering about six offshore blocks deputy energy minister mohamed amin adam said
ghana currently produces barrels of oil per day bpd led by its flagship jubilee field which produces about bpd he said
the west african nation which became a significant oil producer in when it began pumping from the offshore jubilee field is keen to unlock its vast oil and gas resources
adam said global oil majors like bp shell and some independent producers have shown interest in acquiring a stake in oil assets in ghana
we have asked them to wait for our first bidding round which is scheduled for the last quarter of this year adam told reuters in new delhi
he said ghana would put up another six offshore blocks for auction next year
drawn to ghana s hydrocarbon potential exxonmobil corp recently signed a deal with ghana to explore for oil in the deepwater cape three point offshore dwctp oilfield
exxon is doing due diligence to find a local partner to explore the block a condition required to operate a field in ghana he said
once they select the local partner we are ready to go to parliament for ratification he said
he refused to elaborate on the timeline for completing the deal
aker energy as controlled by norwegian billionaire kjell inge roekke agreed in february to buy hess corporation s ghana unit in a million deal gaining access to a percent stake in the deepwater tano cape three points block
the block holds an estimated million barrels of oil equivalent in contingent resources and potential for a further million barrels
adam said aker may not have to pay capital gains tax on its transaction with hess as the block is covered by a stability clause
stability clauses guarantee that the terms of an oil contract stay the same throughout its life
some of our contracts are covered by stability clauses the contract with hess was covered under a stability agreement so any transfer of ownership may not require capital gains tax he added
however he cautioned the question is subject to interpretation by ghana revenue authorities
he said italy s eni which has stake in two blocks in ghana wants more blocks in the nation
ghana wants to be a petroleum hub for west africa
it has drawn up plans to build four refineries of about bpd each in the next years he said
ghana s only oil refinery the tema oil refinery processes about bpd of oil far below its capacity
very soon we will launch a programme to attract investment into refineries he added
