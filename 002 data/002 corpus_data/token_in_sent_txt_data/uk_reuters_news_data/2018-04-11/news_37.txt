update 1-asn imposes test on more weldings at edf's flamanville reactor
paris reuters french utility edf will have to inspect more weldings at the nuclear plant it is building in flamanville france after flaws were discovered in the weldings of the reactor s secondary circuit nuclear regulator asn said
edf said on tuesday that problems with flamville weldings were worse than first expected and may impact the cost and startup of the project
the utility will comment on the schedule at the end of may after it has verified all weldings in the secondary circuit that conducts steam from the steam generator to the plant s turbines
the asn considers that edf will have to extend its controls to other circuits the regulator said in a statement
the asn did not specify whether it wanted an inspection of weldings on the primary circuit which conducts steam from the reactor vessel to the steam generator or an inspection of all weldings on the entire nuclear plant
the asn said that its april inspection of the weldings of flamanville s secondary circuit had shown that edf and reactor builder framatome had not adequately overseen the verification of the weldings by suppliers at the time of their installation
it said edf had only discovered the problems with the weldings during an overall inspection of the plant in early march
the reactor is scheduled to load nuclear fuel in december
any major further delay to flamanville s epr reactor the same type edf is building in hinkley point in britain could add hundreds of millions of euros to the budget and negatively impact edf earnings
