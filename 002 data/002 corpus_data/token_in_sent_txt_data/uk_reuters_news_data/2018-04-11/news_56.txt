airbus sees backloaded deliveries in 2018, reaffirms target
reuters airbus chief executive tom enders said on wednesday the planemaker expects deliveries of narrowbody jets once again to be backloaded towards the latter part of the year possibly even more so than before due to ongoing engine issues
deliveries have been delayed by delivery and quality problems on engines provided by pratt whitney and most recently engines from venture cfm
deliveries have been suspended
both engine suppliers for airbus narrowbody jets remain stressed but airbus whose main rival is boeing is sticking by a target of delivering some aircraft this year enders said
we are quite optimistic they can meet goals but it is not going to be a walk in the park he said at the company s annual shareholder meeting monitored by webcast
