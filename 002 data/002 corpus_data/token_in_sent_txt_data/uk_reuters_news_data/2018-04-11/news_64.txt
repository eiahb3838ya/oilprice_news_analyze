update 2-sinopec plans overhaul at largest refinery as it cuts saudi oil
sinopec s zhenhai refinery plans full shutdown through may four independent plants starting planned maintenance zhenhai shutdown coincides with sinopec s plan to slash may saudi oil loading adds shutdowns at independents quote by chen aizhu and meng meng beijing april reuters sinopec corp will shut down its largest refinery for maintenance throughout may and at least four independent oil plants have started overhauls this month curbing china s crude oil demand
the news comes after sinopec china s largest state refiner announced big cuts in its saudi oil imports
sinopec s bpd zhenhai refining and chemical company will be shut down from may for maintenance in a major overhaul planned once every four years an industry source briefed on the matter told reuters on wednesday
the overhaul at zhenhai one of the country s largest processors of saudi crude oil coincides with sinopec s decision on tuesday to slash crude oil imports from saudi arabia during the month
four independent refineries with total processing capacity of barrels per day bpd shandong haiyou petrochemical group co tianhong chemical zhonghai fine chemicals and rizhao lanqiao port chemicals are currently being shut down according to ding xu an analyst with zibo longzhong information group
independent plants are battling with lower margins as crude oil prices went up dampening demand for crude and leading to more maintenance plans said ding
a survey by longzhong showed the utilisation ratio at independent plants fell to percent this week versus percent in early january ding added
a new tax rule that came into effect in march aimed at curbing alleged tax evasions by independents also limited smaller refiners appetite for crude leading to brimming tanks and cargo congestion at shandong ports late last month
an official with sinopec s trading arm unipec said on tuesday the refiner planned to cut saudi crude oil imports loading in may by percent after saudi aramco set official selling prices
one of the reasons cited by a separate company official on tuesday for the deep cuts was planned refinery maintenances
the official did not elaborate
the zhenhai plant will also shut down its million ethylene complex during the same period for overhaul said the source familiar with the repair works
sinopec media relation officials were not immediately available for comment
