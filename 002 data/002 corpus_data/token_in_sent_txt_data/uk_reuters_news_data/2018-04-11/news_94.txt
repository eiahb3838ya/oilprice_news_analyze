northern china ozone pollution getting worse - study
shanghai reuters concentrations of hazardous ozone have worsened in northern china despite efforts to tackle air pollution according to a study published by peking university on tuesday
stringent winter restrictions on industry transportation and coal consumption enabled northern chinese regions to meet politically crucial air quality targets for the period
but while concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as fell average daytime ozone levels jumped sharply according to a study of pollution data in northern cities by peking university s guanghua school of management and the center for statistical science
also known as sunburn for the lungs ozone is caused by the interaction of sunlight with nitrogen oxides and the vast amounts of uncontrolled volatile organic compounds vocs produced by burning fossil fuels
traffic congestion is a major cause
ozone is one of six components of china s official air quality index along with sulphur dioxide nitrogen oxides carbon monoxide and larger airborne particles known as
ozone rose throughout the region with concentrations up percent or more in northern cities from to the study said
cuts in other forms of pollution are believed to have contributed to the rise
regional declines in the amount of and have reduced the volume of floating particles and increased the strength of the sunlight required to produce ozone the paper said
a study by chinese researchers published last year identified ozone as a growing health risk that had caused a rise in deaths from strokes and heart disease
if you look at the public health impact is responsible for more than a million premature deaths per year whereas ozone is somewhere above said lauri myllyvirta clean air campaigner with environment group greenpeace
but last summer ozone really spiked and it is deservedly going to get more attention he said adding that china should set targets to cut nitrogen oxide and voc emissions in its next air quality plan due to be published later this year
