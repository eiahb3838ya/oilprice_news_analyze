exclusive-tesla targets november 2019 for start of model y production -sources
san francisco reuters tesla inc is targeting november as the start of production for its model y sport utility vehicle with production in china to begin two years later two sources told reuters this week shedding some light on the electric vehicle maker s next project that could tax its resources and capacity
reuters has learned the silicon valley company led by chief executive elon musk is accepting preliminary bids for supplier contracts on the model y a compact crossover companion to the model sedan
tesla has given suppliers scant details about the programme and had not provided a production time frame but has now indicated the vehicle would begin to be built at its fremont california plant in november of next year the two sources with knowledge of the supply chain said
tesla declined to comment
the new model y details show that tesla is pushing ahead on plans to build a new vehicle even as it struggles to produce the model which launched in july
despite initially attracting about advance orders in the form of refundable deposits the sedan s launch has been plagued by delays and manufacturing bottlenecks postponing tesla s anticipated revenue stream and exacerbating a cash crunch for the company
earlier this month tesla tried to reassure investors saying its weekly model output had doubled during the first quarter and that production rates would accelerate through the second quarter to units per week or about vehicles per year
competitive bidding is a crucial early step in the complicated process of automotive manufacturing
after the automaker discloses its plans suppliers compete based on factors including cost and technology
tesla issued to suppliers what is known as a request for information or rfi which gives a directional view of what will be needed
with a new car model automakers normally choose parts suppliers two to years before the start of production
at about years away a november start date for the model y would be considered aggressive but possible said one of the sources
a shorter timeline is potentially feasible the source said as the model y will be built on the same platform as the model
tesla is known for its aggressive timelines and high in order to get cars to market quicker
to save time and cost tesla made the risky bet to skip a testing phase for the model in order to advance straight to production tooling which is harder to fix if problems arise as reuters first reported last year
million model ys
the model y is just one of many projects in the pipeline for tesla which also launched a tesla semi and a new roadster in recent months
it is spending to build out its gigafactory battery factory in nevada where battery module assembly issues have contributed to model delays and also expects to build a factory in china in the near future
tesla has said it will not need to raise additional funds this year
but moody s cited the likelihood of a capital raise of more than billion in its downgrade of the company last month spurred by concerns about cash reserves and tesla s ability to meet production targets
the company burned through billion last year
without giving a time frame musk in february told analysts the company would aim for production capacity of million model ys per year
the two sources said suppliers could be estimating an annual production of vehicles in the united states with much lower volume in china likely in the tens of thousands
building model ys per year would be the equivalent of what musk has planned for total production in fremont by the end of this year although the company is nowhere near that volume
suppliers generally use automakers production targets to formulate a good guess on how many vehicles will actually be built based on the individual automaker s capability to execute and consumer demand
one of the sources said tesla s rfi was light on details compared with other automakers and did not provide volume estimates for the model musk said in february that capital investments related to the suv would begin towards the end of
tesla has said its current factory in fremont could produce vehicles a week what the company hopes it will build in the model alone some time in without the need for a new building although some in the industry believe there is not enough room at the plant to support that volume
any major model y programme would likely require a new facility although low volume of the model y could be built on the existing model line the sources said
