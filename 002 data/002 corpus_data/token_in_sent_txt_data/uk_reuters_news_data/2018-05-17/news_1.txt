u.s. epa moves to undo obama-era chemical disaster rules
washington reuters the environmental protection agency took steps on thursday to roll back and delay rules aimed at improving safety at chemical plants which had come in response to a explosion at a fertilizer plant in texas that killed people
epa administrator scott pruitt introduced a proposal to rescind the measures saying it would save the industry tens of millions of dollars a year and better address potential security the rule proposes to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens address the concerns of stakeholders and emergency responders on the ground and save americans roughly million a year pruitt said in a statement
the proposal would also delay some of the compliance dates of the amendments and cancel certain provisions that address accident prevention
it was the latest in a string of trump administration proposals aimed at rolling back environmental regulations put in place by former democratic president barack obama which industry groups have said added to their regulatory burdens
in january before republican president donald trump took office the epa introduced several changes to companies risk management plans they submit to the agency including requiring more analysis of safety technology audits and incident investigation analyses and stricter emergency preparedness requirements
last february the epa received a petition from a coalition of chemical and energy industry groups including the american chemistry council and american petroleum institute to delay and reconsider the amendments
the explosion at the west texas fertilizer plant killed people including firefighters
scores of others were injured and more than homes were damaged in the blast with total damaged estimated at more than million
the source of the explosion was ammonium nitrate stored in a wooden container at the plant investigators said
the epa press release announcing the proposed changes to the obama administration amendments included a statement from the national association of chemical distributors
the obama administration would have imposed significant new costs on industry without identifying or quantifying the safety benefits to be achieved through new requirements the lobby group s president eric byer said
the united steelworkers union said in a statement on thursday it strongly opposed the proposed rollbacks
usw members work in dangerous facilities that house huge quantities of hazardous chemicals
we are strongly opposed to this deregulation that endangers workers and their communities the group said
the proposed rule will be open to public comment for days and a public hearing on the rule is scheduled for june
