as oil rises, warnings emerge from u.s. retailers
new york reuters worries about rising oil prices have begun to creep into retailers earnings calls and investors are raising concerns that those costs may slow discretionary spending among americans and push down the performance of the retailers shares
oil prices climbed on thursday to their highest levels since november with brent crude touching per barrel and west texas intermediate wti surpassing per barrel
retailers have begun to address the possible impact of oil s rise on their businesses
in a media call after its quarterly report on thursday walmart inc said some consumers may be feeling pressure from higher gas prices though demand remained strong
walmart and home depot inc also have pointed to increased transportation costs stemming from more expensive fuel and a shortage of drivers factors that have put pressure on their margins
walmart s lower margins sent its shares falling percent on thursday
though consumer sentiment remains strong for now several investors said oil prices could threaten consumer spending if they continue to rise offsetting the positive effects of s tax overhaul
the numbers now are pretty dramatic in terms of the price of oil so it is going to continuously feed in over the next few months and people are going to notice said david joy chief market strategist at ameriprise financial in boston
several investors pointed to per barrel for wti crude as the threshold that could dampen consumer spending
i think another would put the issue into sharper perspective for more people said john carey a portfolio manager at amundi pioneer asset management in boston
but the effects of more expensive oil may vary from retailer to retailer
a store like walmart will feel it before a store like macy s said kinahan chief market strategist at td ameritrade in chicago because macy s attracts comparatively more wealthy customers
macy s inc shares jumped percent on wednesday after the department store reported robust sales growth in its results
discount retailers such as dollar general corp may also be among the first to feel a pinch from rising oil as shoppers cut back on spending kinahan said
but if oil continues to climb those stores along with walmart may eventually see benefits as consumers tighten their belts and look for deals he added
indeed other investors said some retailers may show resilience as oil takes up more of consumers budgets
you have to look at each company individually said oliver pursche chief market strategist at bruderman asset management in new york
i continue to think that consumer discretionary companies with pricing power should fare pretty reporting by april joyner additional reporting by nandita bose chuck mikolajczak and sinéad carew in new york editing by will dunham
