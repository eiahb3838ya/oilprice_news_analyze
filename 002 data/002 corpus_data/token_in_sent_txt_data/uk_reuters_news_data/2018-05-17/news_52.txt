international companies with interests in many countries make their own choices according to their own interests
they should continue to have this freedom he said on arriving for a second day of eu leaders talks in the bulgarian capital
but what is important is that companies and especially companies which are perhaps less exposed to other markets american or others can make this choice the eu wants to salvage the iran nuclear deal which offers the islamic republic relief from economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme and europe sees as an important element of international security
however eu officials say there is no easy way to protect eu firms from sanctions and that it will take time for the bloc to devise what will likely be a complex mix of national and measures
