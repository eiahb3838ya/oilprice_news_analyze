update 1-german minister tells carmakers to speed up diesel refits
berlin reuters german environment minister svenja schulze urged carmakers to speed up technical refits of diesel cars to improve air quality after the european commission said on thursday it was taking the country to court for failing to respect air quality limits
the european commission has decided to take france germany hungary italy romania and britain to the eu court of justice over the issue
if we are to survive in court we need more and faster progress to make the air clean schulze said in a statement
we need refits for diesel as soon as possible and at the expense of carmakers as they caused the problem she added
german carmaker volkswagen admitted in to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner
the scandal also known as dieselgate led to a regulatory crackdown that is threatening thousands of jobs as customers increasingly shun cars
schulze a member of the social democrats said the commission s decision showed that the government had to change it strategy
to hope that the problem will be solved by itself as some apparently do is now no longer an option she warned
chancellor angela merkel s conservatives are more cautious though warning that it would not be wise to make the car cover the whole cost of refits as this would weaken their ability to invest in greener technologies
merkel told lawmakers on wednesday that the government had a responsibility to tell the industry that it had to restore trust
but she opposed calls to further increase the burden on carmakers to retrofit vehicles that produce excessive emissions
merkel also called for europe to support the development of the battery and software technologies needed if electric vehicles become the cars of the future since otherwise europe risks losing its manufacturing abilities to asia and north america
