update 1-canada minister eyes pension funds for kinder morgan project
manitoba reuters canada s finance minister bill morneau on thursday highlighted the country s pension funds as possible investors in kinder morgan inc s pipeline expansion but industry sources were skeptical about attracting new investors
morneau on wednesday raised the prospect of foreign funding saying plenty of investors would be interested if kinder morgan canada walked away from the project
we have very sophisticated canadian pension funds and institutional investors that have a high level of understanding of how you embark on infrastructure projects and a great deal of experience around the world in bringing those projects to completion morneau told reuters in an interview
morneau declined to say whether the government was in active discussions with potential investors
kinder morgan has set a may deadline for ottawa to provide assurances it can proceed with the expansion that will more than double the capacity of its trans mountain line from alberta to british columbia
british columbia through which most of the pipeline runs opposes it on environmental grounds
the issue could spark one of the biggest crises for prime minister justin trudeau whose liberal government approved the expansion
trudeau says oil producers are losing c billion billion a year because pipeline bottlenecks mean they can not get crude to export markets
morneau said the government is intervening because of the exceptional circumstances around the project
in a separate interview mark machin chief executive of canada pension plan investment board said the pension fund manager the country s biggest could consider the project
if it s an opportunity that has decent returns then we ll look at it machin said adding the government s pledge to protect investors against political risk was helpful
a canadian energy industry source who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter said morneau s comments about potential new investors were puzzling
companies are likely more focused on easing pipeline bottlenecks south of the border and are not interested in taking on the trans mountain project which faces fierce opposition the source said
hundreds of people have been arrested in burnaby the british columbia port where the pipeline ends
it doesn t matter who the owner is even if it s the federal government you re not getting the grandma off the picket line in burnaby said the source
a calgary oil trader said morneau s assurances struck the wrong chord
i don t want the government involved in owning or funding a pipeline
two governments from now who knows what they would do with it
just the wrong message to the industry kinder morgan canada already operates the trans mountain pipeline and it is unclear whether it would welcome a rival taking over the expansion
an option might be to let an overseas company to step in but foreign investment in canada s energy sector could be a sensitive issue
andrew botterill national oil and gas leader at deloitte which advises energy companies said investors think canadian pipelines and other resource projects generally face high political risk
that s the type of risk that makes it very difficult for companies to come in and invest in canada when they re looking globally for stability he said
a source with deep ties to the natural resources sector who was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter suggested canada s recently created infrastructure bank might be the best way to invest
the agency is open for business but has yet to facilitate financing for any project
morneau and the infrastructure bank declined to comment on whether it could be involved
