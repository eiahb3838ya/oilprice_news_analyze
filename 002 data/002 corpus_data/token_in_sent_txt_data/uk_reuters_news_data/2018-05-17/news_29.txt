exclusive-dubai aerospace in talks to place huge order for 400 jets
adds detail background by alexander cornwell dubai may reuters dubai aerospace enterprise dae one of the world s largest aircraft lessors is in talks to buy jetliners from airbus and boeing and is prepared to expand its fleet through acquisition if talks fall through its ceo told reuters
the move comes months after a leading airline investor orchestrated a record deal last november for a group of airlines to buy more than planes from airbus as economists project strong growth for air travel
dae is interested in buying airbus and boeing max planes after its acquisition last year of lessor awas dae chief executive firoz tarapore said on thursday
any deal would not necessarily be evenly split between the two planemakers tarapore said adding that dae was nowhere near where we thought we would be in finalising an order
we are not happy with the price he said in an interview at dae s offices in dubai s financial district
an order for jets would be worth more than billion at list prices though discounts are common for large orders
boeing declined to comment and airbus did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment
a huge deal would give dae a pipeline of directly ordered aircraft on par with its rivals though it may have to wait several years for deliveries to start because manufactures are heavily sold out
tarapore told reuters last june that dae was considering a large order for more than new aircraft with deliveries to start from
dae would look at other options to acquire new aircraft if it does not reach an agreement with airbus or boeing which tarapore said could include acquiring a rival to gain access to its order book for aircraft
dae jetted into the top tier of aircraft lessors last year when it acquired awas the industry s firm at the time
the acquisition tripled dae s portfolio to about owned and managed aircraft worth over billion
dae is operating very smoothly tarapore said adding that the integration of awas was completed in february
in the meantime dae is considering issuing a million sukuk this year or in and a conventional dollar bond in the fourth quarter of this year tarapore said
the bond issues are not dependent on finalising an aircraft order he added
dae intends to be a repeat benchmark issuer in the debt market he told reuters in october
a benchmark issue conventionally means upwards of million
dae raised billion in the united states through a senior bond issue in to finance the awas deal
