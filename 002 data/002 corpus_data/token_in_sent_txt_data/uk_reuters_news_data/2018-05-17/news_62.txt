explainer-new rules on ship emissions herald sea change for oil market
london reuters new rules coming into force from to curb pollution produced by the world s ships are worrying everyone from opec oil producers to bunker fuel sellers and shipping companies
the regulations will slash emissions of sulfur which is blamed for causing respiratory diseases and is a component of acid rain that damages vegetation and wildlife
but the energy and shipping industries are say analysts with refiners likely to struggle to meet higher demand for cleaner fuel and few ships fitted with equipment to reduce sulfur emissions
this raises the risk of a chaotic shift when the new rules are implemented alongside more volatility in the oil market
the reality is that the industry has already passed the date beyond the smooth transition neil atkinson head of the oil industry and market division at the international energy agency iea said in april
the rules drawn up by the international maritime organization imo will ban ships using fuel with a sulfur content higher than percent compared to percent now unless a vessel has equipment to clean up its sulfur emissions
any vessels failing to comply will face fines could find their insurance stops being valid and might be declared unseaworthy which would bar them from sailing
the global shipping fleet now consumes about million barrels per day bpd of high sulfur fuel oil but about million bpd of that demand will disappear overnight according to the average market forecast calculated by norway s seb bank
most demand is expected to shift to marine gasoil a lower sulfur distillate fuel
morgan stanley predicts this will generate at least million bpd in extra demand for distillate in the next three years pushing up total distillate demand growth for the period to million bpd
that in turn will drive up prices
gasoil now trades at a premium of about a ton to fuel oil but the forward curve forecasts this will balloon to per ton by early
thomson reuters research estimates fuel accounts for about half a ship s daily operating cost
based on average fuel consumption of to tonnes a day a ship using cleaner fuel faces extra daily expenses of about to
for example a vlcc one of the biggest oil tankers at sea will pay percent more for its fuel or an extra on top of normal bill of million for a typical voyage from the middle east to japan
shipowners can install kit called a scrubber that strips out sulfur emissions and allowing them to use the dirtier fuel oil
some ships already have them
global trading firm trafigura has ordered scrubbers for its fleet of ships
but the equipment alone can cost million to million according to manufacturer wartsila putting it out of reach of many operators
by about ships could have scrubbers according to wartsila seb bank and industry analyst alphatanker
but alphatankers andrew wilson called this a drop in the ocean given there are about vessels in the global fleet of which about ply international routes
based on the limited number of manufacturers and time constraints on facilities to install scrubbers alphatanker estimates no more than ships could be fitted each year
wartsila puts the figure closer to
so it would take more than years to fit the global fleet
many vessels may try to dodge the new rules unable to afford the cost of scrubbers and reluctant to pay the premium for cleaner fuel
but how much of the industry will cheat is open to debate with estimates ranging from to percent
the imo says it will ban ships that do not have scrubbers from carrying any fuel oil making it easier to catch cheaters
oil major bp expects percent of ships could cheat while consultancy wood mackenzie expects a figure of about percent when the rules launch in
consultant citac says industry polls indicate cheating could be in a range of to percent
the global refining industry needs to process an extra million bpd of crude to make distillates for cleaner fuel says robert herman refining executive at phillips
some refiners have invested in cutting sulfur in their output but fitting hydrocracker or coker unit so that a refinery produces more distillates with lower sulfur content while reducing fuel oil output can cost about billion analysts say
small refineries unable to afford the upgrade may find they are churning out fuel oil without finding buyers
a kbc consultancy survey showed percent of middle eastern and european refineries are not prepared
european plants which tend to be less complex than those in other regions produce more fuel oil and may face the biggest challenge
morgan stanley says refineries of spain s repsol turkey s tupras india s reliance and independent valero are among the best prepared because they already produce high middle distillate and low fuel oil
the simplest way for refineries to produce fuel with less sulfur is to buy and process crude that contains less sulfur a shift that could change demand for different oil grades and lead to greater oil market volatility
for example processing iraq s basra heavy grade with high sulfur content produces as much as percent fuel oil while using light sweet north sea crude with less sulfur produces about percent fuel oil
there will be a bidding war for sweet crude said stephen george chief economist with kbc advanced technologies
this could hike the price of sweeter crudes including several grades used to make dated brent the benchmark for three quarters of the world s oil
meanwhile the cost of refining sour crudes with more sulfur such as those from venezuela mexico and ecuador could be more than its value he said
energy firms and shippers may face a squeeze on margins
but ultimately extra costs are likely to fall on consumers of everything from household appliances to gasoline that are shipped around the world
roughly percent of world trade is by sea
wood mackenzie estimates that global shipping fuel costs are likely to rise by a quarter or billion in
others estimate extra costs for container shipping alone will be billion to billion
in addition a surge in distillate demand by shippers could push up prices of other products such as jet fuel and diesel
it s going to make moving anything more expensive said alphatanker s wilson
