feature-the fog catchers conjuring water out of moroccan mist
sidi ifni morocco may thomson reuters foundation g rowing up on mount boutmezguida in southwest morocco on the edge of the sahara desert khadija ghouate never imagined that the fog enveloping the nearby peaks would change her life
for hours every day and often before sunrise ghouate and other women from nearby villages would walk km miles to fetch water from open wells with girls pulled out of school to help and at risk of violence on the lonely treks
but with groundwater levels dropping due to overuse drought and climate change the challenge to get enough water daily was becoming harder and almost half of people in the local area sold up and quit rural life after generations for the city
as the future of the traditional berber region by mount boutmezguida floundered a mathematician whose family came from the area had a eureka moment gleaned from living overseas using fog to make water
now ghouate s village is connected to the world s largest functioning fog collection project alleviating the need to collect water that fell mainly on women and with equipment setting an example for other projects globally
you always had to go to the wells always be there mornings evenings said ghouate a as she prepared lunch for her family showing off the tap in her home
but now water has arrived in our house
i like fog a lot
the project running since after nine years of surveys and tests was founded by the moroccan organisation dar si hmad which works to promote and preserve local culture history and heritage
it was the brainchild of mathematician and businessman aissa derhem whose parents were originally from mount boutmezguida where the slopes are covered in mist on average days a year
derhem first came across fog collection when he learnt of one of the world s first projects in chile s atacama desert while he living in canada in the studying for his phd
but it was not until visiting his parents village years later that he realised the mountainous location situated at the edge of the sahara and about km miles from the atlantic ocean was perfect for fog
mist accumulates in coastal areas where a cold sea current an anticyclone and a land obstacle such as a mountain range combine
when the sea water evaporates the anticyclone stops it from becoming rain and when it hits the mountain that s where it can be gathered derhem told the thomson reuters foundation looking out from the top of mount boutmezguida besides a small building used as a fog observatory and tool deposit
if we look at the planet we see this happening in all tropical regions
in chile and peru in latin america
the kalahari desert in africa
in western australia
around the thar desert in india and in california he listed as examples
developed in south america in the fog collection projects have since spread globally to countries including guatemala ghana eritrea nepal and the united states
in morocco dar si hmad has built a system of nets stretching about square metres about tennis courts
these nets are hung between two poles and when wind pushes the fog through the mesh water droplets are trapped condense and fall into a container at the bottom of the unit with pipes connecting the water to reservoirs
derhem hopes the success of the mount boutmezguida scheme can help other areas in west africa and in north africa where the united nation s food and agriculture organization fao says fresh water resources are among the world s lowest
studies show climate change impacting water patterns globally and derhem said in morocco levels have dropped to about cubic metres a person a year from about cubic metres a person in the on calculations based on government figures
the principles behind fog collection are simple and throughout nature examples exist of creatures capturing moisture from the air in the most arid conditions ranging from beetles in the namib desert to lizards in the australian outback
but creating a water collection project on a large scale comes with challenges as the research and development as well as the infrastructure and technology involved in expanding and developing fog collection projects can be costly
the project at mount boutmezguida however has been a trailblazer for other projects due to its equipment according to its founders
the original nets used were insufficiently resistant to the high winds and tore but a partnership with the german waterfoundation allowed dar si hmad to develop a stronger net
the cloudfisher was described by the waterfoundation as the first fog collector that can withstand wind speeds of up kph with flexible troughs following the movement of the net in the wind
now collected water is filtered and combined with underground water before being distributed to villages on the grid with homes paying for water through a system
the initial pilot project served five villages
at present the square metres of nets installed reach about families villages while a second set of nets is being built
fog is like aeroplanes at the start
at the beginning they were only little toys but with some effort things have changed but it needs investment said derhem
along the coast there is three times as much fog as there is available on mount boutmezguida
the government spends millions for water desalination processes
this is something that is worth for with dry wells comes anxiety and risk but also the unravelling of traditional livelihoods and communities
mohamed zabour president of the local municipality said more than percent of the inhabitants of the region live without running water in their homes
between and of the local residents moved to cities
our region is rich but it needs infrastructure
and water is one of the priorities said zabour
if we don t find a solution in the next years it s going to be a catastrophe it s going to be like a desert
for ghouate the fog scheme has improved village life
when we were kids we didn t even know what it meant to need water now there is less rain and if i still had to go to the wells i wouldn t find much water now she said
everything is about water everything
i do have to worry about it anymore
