cryptocurrency may light up renewable energy in moldova
london thomson reuters foundation moldova a small landlocked country in eastern europe imports of its energy and has seen its energy prices rise by more than half in the past five years
but that could soon change according to the united nations development programme undp which this year will launch an innovative effort to power a moldovan university with solar energy
the initiative with sun exchange a south african solar power marketplace will allow people to buy solar cells using solarcoin a cryptocurrency launched by blockchain electricchain and then lease them to the technical university of moldova one of the country s largest universities
the idea is to find new sources of finance to help buildings go green overnight in this instance with rooftop solar panels said dumitru vasilescu a programme manager with undp in moldova one of europe s poorest countries
one of the biggest obstacles to countries investing in renewable energy is a lack of finance as you often have to wait to years before you get a return on your investment he told the thomson reuters foundation
but the university will get a full megawatt of energy installed in the summer he said as a result of the effort
owners of the solar cells in turn will receive solarcoins as soon as the university produces energy earning interest of about percent on their investment vasilescu added
moldova currently has over square metres of unused rooftop space on public buildings that could be potentially used for such efforts he said
blockchain which first emerged as the system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin is a digital shared record of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet without the need of a centralised authority
it has become a key technology in both the public and private sectors given its ability to record and keep track of assets or transactions without the need for middlemen
research firm idc estimates global investment in blockchain will more than double in to billion billion pounds from million last year most of it for banking
idc expects strong growth in the energy space between and
kevin treco an associate director at the carbon trust an environmental consultancy said technologies could significantly change energy use in countries striving to decentralise power and boost renewable sources
in moldova for example renewable energy could reduce the country s dependence on energy imports such as oil and gas from russia vasilescu said
darius nassiry a senior research associate at the overseas development institute a british think tank predicted that most of the growth in energy would occur in the developing world
they have energy and a more accommodating legal and regulatory environment towards such innovations he said by email
but a lack of understanding on how blockchain applications such as cryptocurrencies work could slow their in the energy sector he added
for abraham cambridge the founder and ceo of sun exchange the solar currency exchange system has all the right incentives in place
it reduces the costs of going solar dramatically for the end user and makes it easy for anyone in the world to own a solar cell anywhere in the world and from it make a steady source of income he said in a statement
blockchain is also being used in the energy sector to facilitate carbon trading with computing giant ibm announcing this week that it will partner with veridium labs an environmental tech to turn carbon credits into digital tokens
if the moldovan solar currency pilot is successful undp plans to replicate it in neighbouring countries said vasilescu adding that it could revolutionise the renewable energy market for eastern europe and central asia
