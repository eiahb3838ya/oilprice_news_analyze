land acquisition woes thwart india's mega refinery plan with saudi aramco
delhi reuters at the international energy forum in delhi in april the world s top oil producer saudi aramco inked a preliminary deal to partner with a consortium of indian players to build a billion refinery and petrochemical project on india s west coast
the huge project was touted as a gamechanger for both parties offering india steady fuel supplies and meeting saudi arabia s need to secure regular buyers for its oil
despite the obvious benefits though the prospects for the plan in the works since are growing dimmer by the day
thousands of farmers oppose the refinery and are refusing to surrender land fearing it could damage a region famed for its alphonso mangoes vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood
we earn enough to fulfil our needs and we do not want to surrender our lands for a refinery at any cost says sandesh desai standing amid his mango orchard in nanar a village in ratnagiri district some km miles south of mumbai
land acquisition has always been a contentious issue in rural india where a majority of the population depends on farming for their livelihood
in for example india s tata motors had to shelve plans for a car factory in an eastern state after facing widespread protests from farmers
and while prime minister narendra modi has tried to ease land acquisition rules to jumpstart delayed projects worth tens of billions of dollars the government has faced resistance to amending populist laws enacted by his predecessors
like desai a majority of the farmers from villages around ratnagiri that need to be relocated for the refinery project firmly oppose the plan a state government official told reuters
opposition politicians and even a local ally of modi s bhartiya janta party bjp support the farmer movement complicating matters further for the government ahead of state and general elections in
the state government which is responsible for acquiring the land for the project has so far failed to secure even one acre of the roughly acres needed for the refinery maharashtra industries minister subhash desai told reuters
the state is not going to acquire land as a majority of the farmers are against the plan said desai the minister who is a member of the shiv sena a regional party allied with the bjp in the maharashtra state government
under land acquisition rules at least percent of the land owners need to provide consent for a project he said
still some believe that the opponents are only objecting to get better compensation packages for their land
eventually all stakeholders will give their consent but it will take time said ajay singh sengar who heads a rival forum that supports the refinery project
a local government official in the area said he thought many farmers would agree to a deal once a compensation package was announced
the ratnagiri refinery petrochemicals ltd rrpl which is running the project says the bpd refinery and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of million tonnes per year will help create direct and indirect employment for up to people with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing
but farmers say they have sufficient work in their orchards and fields
we don t have enough people to maintain our mango orchards
that s why every year we employ migrant labour from nepal says arvind samant the secretary of a farmers and fishermen s group that was created to organise opposition to the project
samant says instead of a refinery the government should bring plants or other industries that suit local needs
rrpl a joint venture between indian oil corp ioc hindustan petroleum and bharat petroleum said suggestions the refinery would hurt the environment were baseless
it says it will continue to cultivate mangoes and cashews on some acres of land around the project
despite the opposition rrpl is hopeful the project will proceed
some people misguided farmers and created fear
we re now trying to answer each and every doubt said anil nagwekar a spokesman for the rrpl adding rrpl was struggling to convince farmers as they refused to even discuss the plan with the company
hundreds of people have joined protests blocking surveyors from even measuring land needed for the site said omkar prabhudesai who heads the local group opposing the project
there is no point in listening to the company s views
we have already decided not to give our land said prabhudesai
the refinery announced in was to be commissioned by but delays in land acquisition mean the deadline is likely to be pushed back
ideally the state government should have acquired land by now and the work for the project should have started
the delay could impact deadlines said rrpl s nagwekar
saudi aramco declined to comment while india s oil ministry did not respond to a reuters email seeking comment
even if the government wanted to implement the project it would not start any land acquisition process before elections in conceded a senior state government official who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter
sensing political mileage every political party is opposing the project
for the next one year there won t be any progress the official said
workers of the maharashtra navnirman sena mns a regional party vandalised offices of rrpl in mumbai in april
an mns spokesman confirmed reports of the incident and said the party was strongly opposed to the refinery plan
parties like the indian national congress and the nationalist congress party also oppose the plan
still some officials remain hopeful
building a large project such as this in india was possible but could take years said ioc s head of refineries rama gopal
we conceived the paradip refinery project in he said referring to a plant it runs on the east coast
but for various reasons the project got delayed and it was finally only commissioned in reporting by rajendra jadhav and nidhi verma editing by euan rocha and alex richardson
