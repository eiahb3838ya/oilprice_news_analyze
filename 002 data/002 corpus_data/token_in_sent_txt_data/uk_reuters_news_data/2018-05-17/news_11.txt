u.s. power grid ready for summer, but calif. & texas are concerns -ferc
reuters most regions are prepared to meet power and natural gas demand this summer but shortages are possible in southern california due to low hydropower and gas supplies and texas following the retirement of several coal plants federal energy regulators said in a report on thursday
in southern california staff at the federal energy regulatory commission ferc said hydro generation may create challenges as natural generation the replacement for hydro production shortfalls in past years may be limited due to reduced gas storage capacity and local pipeline outages in the region
nationwide the staff said north american reliability coordinators forecast demand for electricity from the grid would be about the same as last summer due to increased use of demand response programs to reduce usage and distributed energy resources like home solar panels
if the forecasts for warmer than normal weather this summer are correct the report said gas burned to produce electricity could top s record high due to the addition of over megawatts of new generation and low gas prices making gas a cheaper fuel than coal in many regions
one megawatt can power about homes
the report said energy firms were expected to add over mw of mostly gas and renewable generation through the end of the summer
that new capacity will replace much of the roughly mw of generation that has retired since may including about mw of capacity
but the new plants are not necessarily located where the old plants retired
the shutdown over the past six months of the big brown monticello and sandow coal plants in texas helped cut its reserve margin to percent which is below the grid s percent target
the texas grid operator the electric reliability council of texas ercot said it expects to have sufficient operational tools to manage tight reserves and maintain system reliability
those tools include using a previously mothballed power plant imports from other regions and consumer conservation and demand response efforts
in california the grid operator said it also expects to use demand response programs and consumer conservation to mitigate tight supply conditions this summer
gas supplies in southern california are expected to remain tight this summer due to limitations on aliso canyon the biggest gas storage field in the state and gas pipeline outages and reductions
