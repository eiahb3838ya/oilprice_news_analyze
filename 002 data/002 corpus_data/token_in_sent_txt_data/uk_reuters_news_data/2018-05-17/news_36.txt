mexico's landmark energy reforms are mired in regulatory delays
mexico city may reuters oil firms that have won drilling rights during mexico s landmark energy reforms have made little progress on developing about of the projects because of the nation s tangled regulatory regime according to company executives and government data
mexico has auctioned off more than contracts to foreign and local companies since president enrique pena nieto started opening the nation s oil fields to foreign investment in
a new oil regulatory framework much of it adapted from existing rules has kept most of that oil in the ground the data show
that s delaying potential benefits to mexico and could make the reforms that much easier to unwind if voters elect an candidate for president when pena nieto leaves office at the end of november
securing approvals is a cumbersome and arduous process resulting in a significant choke point for drilling wells said craig steinke chief executive of renaissance oil corp which has five projects in mexico three of them stalled in permitting
it takes three days to get needed drilling permits for a well in alberta canada compared to the more than a year in mexico steinke said
through the life of a project oil firms are required to submit more than separate documents to about a dozen government agencies overseeing offshore and onshore developments
before mexico s energy reforms oil firm petroleos mexicanos known as pemex was the sole operator and largely regulated itself
the opening of development rights to private firms ushered in a new regulator known as asea operating under a presidential appointee with sweeping powers but also a legacy of bureaucratic constraints
asea mexico s safety energy and environment regulator must decide on about permits for each project according to marco cota a former head of exploration and production for the energy ministry who now advises oil companies on regulatory compliance
many of the agency s industrial safety regulations were inherited from the environment ministry and duplicate paperwork required by other agencies he said
asea director carlos de regules a former pemex official conceded in an interview that the agency s has been too slow
he said he is working to cut permit reviews to days by september compared to the current process that can stretch nearly a
the regulatory framework is very complicated and it forces us to take more time than in principle should be necessary to evaluate a project he said of rules in place since the energy reform laws were enacted
we are obligated to ask seven times for the same evaluations can take about six months for environmental impacts and three months for a final drilling permit just two of the approvals required before work can begin on a new well
companies also must show they have insurance policies and industrial safety and environmental protection plans approved and in place for each project
the latter requires companies to submit reams of supplemental documents such as safety manuals
the delays stem in large part from the fact that asea is adapting and interpreting laws originally written for general environmental protections and were not specific to the energy industry said layla vargas who works with oil companies to meet government regulations
what they ve had to do is to fit the energy sector said cota
staffing shortages are another major bottleneck
the regulator has employees who handle approvals for more than project applications since the opening ranging from retail gas stations to dollar drilling projects
permits for a service station can take as much as seven months to approve according to the agency
the organization for economic cooperation and development which promotes economic development last fall called for asea to have more institutional agility and autonomy in its evaluation of mexico s energy regulators
asea s administrative complexity is the biggest challenge to getting oil and gas projects underway said renaissance oil s steinke and other oil company executives
so far asea has signed off on insurance policies for of oil and gas contracts awarded
the companies management system a custom plan for mitigating risks in environmental health and safety areas has been authorized for projects
approvals for both are needed before drilling can begin
to date exploration and production projects won at auction by international oil firms including exxon mobil and royal dutch shell are in various stages of regulatory process
the numbers of approvals are not great said a senior executive at an oil major who oversees contracts in mexico speaking on condition of anonymity
at least one oil company said it has not had problems with unreasonable delays
we ve had a good experience in mexico said felipe arbalaez bp plc s president for latin america
the regulators have given us approvals at the appropriate time he added referring to the british company s shallow water hokchi project which is run by its argentine unit pan american energy
but john padilla a oil consultant with ipd latin america said oil companies who bet big on the mexican opening are increasingly concerned about the political and regulatory risks
no one s jumping ship he said
but when you have billions of dollars of investment at stake you can be damn sure that every board out there around the globe that has investments in mexico is going to be paying close attention to additional reporting by marianna parraga in houston editing by gary mcwilliams and brian thevenot
