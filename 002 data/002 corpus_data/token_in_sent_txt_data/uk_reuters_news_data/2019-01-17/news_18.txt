russia, serbia sign nuclear cooperation agreement
paris jan reuters russia and serbia have signed a cooperation agreement on civil nuclear energy russian reactor builder rosatom said in a statement on thursday
the intergovernmental agreement covers construction and modernization of research nuclear reactors and nuclear medicine development
that it comes so soon after a previous deal signed by russia and serbia in sochi last year could signal more concrete steps ahead
rosatom has nuclear cooperation deals with dozens of developing countries
these agreements are not contracts to sell nuclear reactors
they can be a first step towards such a deal but often talks go on for years with little progress
