by clyde russell launceston australia jan reuters the spot price of liquefied natural gas lng in asia has completely missed its usual winter peak with much of the blame being laid at the door of temperatures trimming demand
that sounds perfectly plausible but doesn t quite tally with the fact that delivered volumes into the major consuming region of northeast asia hit a in december
a total of million tonnes of the fuel were delivered in december to the region which includes the top three consumers of japan china and south korea according to and port data compiled by refinitiv
this was up percent from the same month in adding to a gain in shipments in november from the same month a year earlier
it was also the most on record eclipsing the million tonnes from january
china was the main driver of the jump in imports with million tonnes arriving in december up percent from the same month in
top consumer japan saw imports weaken dropping by percent to million tonnes in december whilst south korea recorded an increase to million tonnes
the shipping data does show that lng demand was strong for the first part of the northern winter but it doesn t yet give a picture of how the rest of the cold season will play out
it s here that the spot pricing comes into play and this is pointing to a weak of winter
the spot price for cargoes delivered to asia was per million british thermal units mmbtu in the week ended
it has been trending down since a minor early winter peak of per mmbtu in the week to and is well below the of reached in the week to june
the spot price is usually for deliveries of around four to eight weeks in advance so the current price reflects cargoes that will arrive in february
it s worth noting that the reached in reflected cargoes delivered in december when demand reached an high in northeast asia
the fact that even this strong demand couldn t spark a sustained rally in prices shows that it s more likely ample supply is playing a greater role than demand
this view is supported by spot prices for march delivery at around per mmbtu being weaker than those for february
there is usually a sharp drop in spot lng prices as winter ends and the market enters the shoulder season of spring and the strength of any summer recovery is largely dependent on how hot the weather is as this drives power demand for
the fact that the winter rally in lng prices didn t materialise even in the face of solid demand growth raises the possibility of a
the market narrative of lng has swung in recent months from one of an expected oversupply on the back of a raft of new projects mainly in australia and the united states to a consensus that strong demand growth in asia will lead to a deficit in coming years unless new ventures are sanctioned
however while this view may well be correct from a perspective it doesn t preclude the possibility of to periods where supply exceeds demand
this may be the situation for the next few months as the spot market struggles to absorb the extra supply from projects that came online in
these include two australian projects in inpex s million tonnes per annum icythys venture and royal dutch shell s prelude floating plant as well as dominion s cove point and cheniere s corpus christi projects in the united states
while the outlook for lng demand growth appears to be rosy once again the market may have little bouts of indigestion every now and again as it has to absorb the lumpy nature of supply additions
