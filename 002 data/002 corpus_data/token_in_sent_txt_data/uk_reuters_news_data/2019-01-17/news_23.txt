trade war shifts feed for u.s. hogs away from ethanol byproduct
chicago reuters a steep downturn in ethanol output linked to the trade war with china is raising costs for american farmers who feed a byproduct of the biofuel to hogs cattle and chickens
sales of the feed known as distillers dried grains or ddgs were one of the bright spots for ethanol makers such as green plains inc valero energy corp
and pacific ethanol inc after china all but stopped buying corn ethanol contributing to oversupply
but now cuts to ethanol production are tightening supplies of ddgs and raising prices paid by livestock farmers
many are turning to other feeds including soybean meal the price of which eased as china halted imports of american soybeans
while soymeal is more expensive than ddgs it is also more nutritious for livestock and therefore more at current prices
the shift away from ddgs is another blow to a struggling biofuel sector
robust demand for ddgs had been a buffer as the lowest ethanol prices in over a decade dragged on the industry
the maschhoffs the largest pork producer roughly halved ddg use from the autumn to december due to routine cost assessments nutrition director omarh mendoza said
ddgs formerly accounted for up to percent of hogs rations he said but the carlyle company now is using more corn and soymeal instead
a lot of ethanol is not being produced and therefore there s not a whole lot of product out there mendoza said about ddgs
ethanol makers slashed production rates last year due in part to negative profit margins according to the companies and traders
green plains the fourth largest producer also put several plants up for sale complaining of burdensome biofuel supplies
the cuts in output pushed up prices of ddgs and prompted switching to soymeal company spokesman jim stark said
still more reductions in ethanol output were necessary as supplies continued to outpace demand stark added
ethanol inventories this month climbed to a of over million barrels even as output slowed to the lowest in over six months energy information administration data showed
prices for ddgs in the eastern half of iowa the top ethanol producing state surged to per ton in december the highest in years according to refinitiv eikon data
meanwhile soymeal prices in cedar rapids iowa were more stable averaging per ton last month
soymeal has more protein than ddgs making it more expensive
however in cedar rapids soymeal s premium to ddgs reached just per ton in the smallest since the data showed
the shift from ddgs is largely in the hog sector a ddgs trader working for a publicly traded company said
cattle generally are not fed as much soymeal and need fiber from ddgs he said
hog producers are cutting the percentage of ddgs in their rations to as little as percent from percent due to high prices said swine nutritionist john goihl who owns nutrition services in shakopee minnesota
farmers are reluctant to abandon ddgs completely because they provide energy amino acids and phosphorus important for healthy animals he said meaning that producers absorb some of the price increase
they ll stay at the lower levels unless this ddg price relationship really gets out of hand goihl said
china formerly the top importer of both ddgs and ethanol last year stopped buying products due to the trade war
thailand recently halted imports of ddgs too over concerns about beetles found in two shipments
exports of ddgs have remained robust elsewhere in asia and in mexico
ddgs had really helped keep the ethanol industry going when ethanol prices were low and supplement margins said arlan suderman chief commodities economist for broker intl fcstone
