update 1-china installed 18 pct less solar power capacity in 2018
shanghai reuters china put just over gigawatts gw of new solar generation capacity into operation in down percent from a year earlier an industry group said on thursday after a government move to curb new capacity and ease a subsidy payment backlog
the new generation took the country s total installed solar power capacity to more than gw by the end of the year the china photovoltaic industry association cpia said
china announced last year that it would suspend new projects after a record gw capacity increase in left it struggling to find spare grid capacity and pay a renewable subsidy backlog amounting to more than billion yuan billion last year
china is also aiming to gradually phase out direct financial support to the solar industry after a decline in costs announcing last week that it would launch a series of new projects
but solar manufacturers are already feeling the pinch and warned last year they were facing closure after a surge in new production capacity in previous years sent component prices plummeting
facing a lot of complicated domestic and overseas trends the sector as a whole is under big pressures and substandard producers are expected to promptly exit the market said wang bohua cpia in a speech on thursday
wang said output of solar equipment continued to increase in despite the decline in new domestic capacity with solar module production up percent to an equivalent of gw
much of the surplus production was diverted to overseas markets with solar component export earnings rising percent from a year earlier to billion wang said according to a transcript published on cpia s official wechat social media account
china s solar manufacturers have been accused of using subsidies to drive down prices and put foreign competitors out of business but they claim they have been the beneficiary of a fierce competitive environment forcing them to reduce costs
the united states imposed tariffs on china s solar products last year and its share of china s exports fell from percent in to percent in
the bulk of china s overseas shipments went to india south east asia and europe
