germany should stick to nord stream 2 project - msc chairman
berlin reuters germany should finish the nord stream gas pipeline despite opposition and growing domestic concerns but future energy projects should be coordinated by the european union a veteran german diplomat said on thursday
wolfgang ischinger chairman of the munich security conference said the initial birth defect of the billion project was the fact that european treaties had allowed the german government to deem the project as purely commercial
in fact he told reporters it was clear that such a large project clearly had a political nature particularly given russia s annexation of the crimea region of ukraine in and other actions in recent years
the pipeline which would carry gas straight to germany under the baltic sea has been criticized in some quarters because it would deprive ukraine of lucrative gas transit fees potentially making kiev more vulnerable in the future
germany and russia have been at odds since moscow annexed crimea but both countries have a common interest in the pipeline which will double capacity of the current route
russian gas giant gazprom is building the project jointly with western partners uniper wintershall engie omv and shell
ischinger cautioned against abandoning the project as it neared its completion date of late citing german foreign policy s focus on consistency and sustainability
saying forget it now would not be good german foreign the ambassador in berlin richard grenell drew fire this week for telling german companies involved in the project that they could face sanctions if they continued with the plan that is already far advanced
germany says sanctions against nord stream would be the wrong way to solve the dispute
