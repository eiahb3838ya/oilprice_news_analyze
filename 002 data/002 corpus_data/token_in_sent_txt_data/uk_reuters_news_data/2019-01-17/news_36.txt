update 1-dutch citizens demand end to quake-hit groningen gas production
the hague reuters angry dutch citizens on thursday asked their country s highest court to put an immediate end to natural gas production in the groningen region due to the risk of earthquakes
once europe s largest gas field decades of extraction have led to dozens of minor tremors every year damaging thousands of homes and sparking unrest among locals and prompting authorities to impose caps on activity at groningen
seismic risks are still increasing all we hear are promises of future improvements but nothing s really happening resident and politician nette kruzenga said in court
an unusually severe magnitude quake prompted the dutch government last year to pledge to end production by and to lower it as quickly as possible in coming years
groningen is run by nam a joint venture between royal dutch shell and exxon mobil
output is set to drop to billion cubic meters bcm in the year that began in october down from a peak of bcm
it will be cut by another percent in the next five years the government has said
production has already been lowered to the lowest possible level state lawyer hans besselink said in court on thursday
further reductions would lead to shortages at companies in the netherlands and but many in the region still feel their safety concerns are being ignored as tremors are expected to continue while numerous attempts to set up a compensation scheme for damage and repairs have failed
the petitioners demand drilling be stopped immediately or at least capped at bcm per year a level the dutch gas regulator last year said would limit risks
we need two to three years to get at bcm it s impossible to reach it straight away without disrupting consequences besselink said
the government expects the bcm level might be reached by the end of by switching large industrial users away from groningen gas and by building extra capacity to convert imported gas to the gas needed for the dutch network
the netherlands still depends on groningen gas for a significant part of its energy supply and export obligations
the high court in said certainty of supply should play a role in decisions on the production level but should not outweigh safety concerns
the court expects to deliver its verdict on
it will also hear other complaints from local authorities and interest groups in april
