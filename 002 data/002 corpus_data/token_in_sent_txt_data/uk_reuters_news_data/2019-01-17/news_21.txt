update 3-before start of new oil pact, opec made progress averting glut
london reuters opec cut oil output sharply in december before a new accord to limit supply took effect it said on thursday suggesting that producers have made a strong start to averting a glut in as a slowing economy curbs demand
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said in a monthly report that its oil output fell by barrels per day bpd in december to million bpd the biggest drop in almost two years
worried by a drop in oil prices and rising supplies opec and allies including russia agreed in december to return to production cuts in
they pledged to lower output by million bpd of which opec s share is bpd
opec secretary general mohammad barkindo told reuters that producers were seeking to avoid a in the industrialised world s oil inventories above the average
they were above that mark in november figures in opec s report showed
we are not yet out of the winter woods he said
the oil industry can not afford to relapse into another downturn he said in reference to a oil market slump
the supply reduction in december means that if opec fully implements the new cut it will avoid a surplus that could weaken prices
oil slid from a barrel in october to less than in december on concerns over excess supply
opec expects global oil demand growth to slow to million bpd from million in though it was more upbeat about the economic backdrop than last month and cited better sentiment in the oil market where crude is back above
while the economic risk remains skewed to the downside the likelihood of a moderation in monetary tightening is expected to slow the decelerating economic growth trend in opec said in the report
barkindo added that he remains optimistic that healthy demand would hold this year
the supply cut was a policy after the producer alliance known as agreed in june to boost supply amid pressure from president donald trump to lower prices and cover an expected shortfall in iranian exports
opec changed course after the slide in prices starting in october
a previous supply curb starting in january when opec production fell by bpd according to opec figures got rid of the glut
the group confirmed on its website that it plans to meet over april in vienna to review the supply cut agreement
opec sources said another meeting could follow in june
the biggest drop in opec supply last month came from saudi arabia and amounted to bpd the report showed
saudi supply in november had hit a record above million bpd after president trump demanded more oil be pumped
the kingdom told opec that it lowered supply to million bpd in december and has said it plans to go even further in january by delivering a larger cut than required under the deal
the was an involuntary cut by libya where unrest led to the shutdown of the country s biggest oilfield
iran registered the decline in output also involuntary as sanctions that started in november discouraged companies from buying its oil
iran libya and venezuela are exempt from the supply pact and are expected by some analysts to post further falls giving a tailwind to the voluntary effort by the others
opec said in the report that demand for its crude would decline to million bpd a drop of bpd from as rivals pump more and the slowing economy curbs demand
delivering the bpd cut from december s level should mean the group would be pumping slightly less than the expected demand for its crude this year and so avoid a surplus
last month s report had pointed to a surplus
the figures for opec production and demand for its crude were lowered by about bpd to reflect qatar s exit from the group which now has members
