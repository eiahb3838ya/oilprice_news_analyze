update 1-'wake up', macron will tell europe in major pre-brexit speech -sources
paris reuters french president emmanuel macron will describe brexit as a call in a speech in coming weeks in which he will outline how europe must be more assertive in the face of rival world powers sources close to macron said
his words are intended as a warning shot for a continent unable to project power and defend itself said aides who described the speech as macron s most important since he spoke at the sorbonne university in paris in september urging fundamental reform of the european union
this is a critical time a source close to macron told reuters
if we europeans don t want to have other brexits and become trapped in a naive defence of status quo we have to wake macron s speech coincides with rising tensions in the west which has been shaken by president donald trump s america first policies and britain s departure from the eu
a more assertive china and russia also pose major challenges
although macron will use britain s planned departure from the eu on march as the main impetus for his speech the aim is not to offer an initiative to unblock the negotiating stalemate between london and brussels the source said
macron s office said on monday the speech will be at end of february or early march although the exact date and location had not yet been fixed
he won t comment on the negotiation or offer some kind of macron plan to fix the problem
the idea is to draw the lessons from brexit the source said
in macron s view brexit is part of the same phenomenon that brought trump to power and sparked the yellow vest movement in france a fear of losing out from globalisation territorial inequalities and rising contempt for the establishment
the french leader will focus on championing a europe that protects in the may european election and seek to convince voters with plans aimed at reforming europe s trade competition digital and climate policies
the speech will also seek to convince his european counterparts who have watered down many of his sorbonne proposals since to start thinking of the eu as a tougher geopolitical player in a ruthless world
the eu has done the internal regulation rather well built a nice peaceful area with benign trade and regulated competition
but europe hasn t understood how to carry itself in a brutal world the source said
