explainer-how south african mines cope with power cuts
reuters south african utility eskom imposed the worst power cuts in several years on homes and businesses last week conjuring up memories of the crisis when the grid nearly collapsed and cost the mining industry billions in lost output
although eskom which supplies around percent of power in africa s most industrialized economy paused the blackouts on friday for the first time in five days it warned that its creaking infrastructure could buckle at any time
a decade ago the state utility ordered mining houses to evacuate all underground staff and cease mining operations for five days as it cut electricity supply to minimum levels
it is not clear how much the industry which consumes about percent of eskom s annual output lost in production but the crisis sent prices of both gold and platinum to record levels and pummelled the rand
but mining companies now appear to be better prepared to cope with the scheduled blackouts thanks largely to an agreement struck in between eskom and the industry that allows it to continue operating on reduced power
the south african mines are probably a little bit better prepared for electricity cuts than they were years ago said peter major an analyst and director of mining at mergence corporate solutions
anglo american platinum ltd amplats the world s top producer of the metal said it lost ounces or less than percent of annual output based on production last week
diversified miners exxaro and anglo american said their operations were affected to varying degrees while anglogold ashanti said safety and production were untouched
an industry group the mineral council did not give specific details about the impact of last week s power cuts on production but said the effect on output for the sector had been minimal
miners including impala platinum harmony and have also been working on reducing their reliance on eskom by setting up their own power generators
however it has been difficult to get that off the ground because of red tape and prohibitive costs they say
south africa is home to the world s biggest platinum group metals deposits accounting for just over percent of global production
any disruption in output could directly affect prices of the white metal
the mining industry directly contributes more than percent to the economy which has been struggling with anaemic growth over the last years
miners among the biggest consumers of electricity in the country are already grappling with weak profits that could be exacerbated by the potential loss of output if eskom imposes deeper power cuts
graphic miners cut power usage but eskom revenues from industry soars the potential impact on jobs is also a concern in a country with a jobless rate of more than percent and has prompted fierce opposition from the country s powerful trade unions to president cyril ramaphohsa s plan to split the utility
with all these power cuts through eskom there will be consequences people will lose their work for less time put in for work and we are very very concerned about this said stanford mazhindu spokesperson of trade union uasa
the agreement between eskom and the mining industry has partly shielded miners from the massive disruption caused by the power cuts when the sector was forced to shut for five days to allow the grid to recover
under the scheme eskom gives the industry notice to reduce their power consumption by between and percent when the national grid is at its tightest and unable to meet demand
if it s a or percent reduction in demand and it goes on for an extended period it can have quite a big impact said sibanye spokesman james wellsted
for instance concentrators are switched off and water pumps that would prevent underground dams from flooding are only turned on during low usage hours at night he said
impala platinum reduces its usage of equipment including furnaces during national peak usage times when residential consumers are just waking up or have just returned from work spokesman johan theron said
despite these measures business leaders and the mineral council are still concerned about the risks eskom poses to the industry
impala s theron said shifting work to an demand period in the middle of the night to catch up on lost production is not ideal or sustainable as it will impact the business over time in that wear on furnaces are accelerated under these operating conditions
while the industry was coping extended rolling blackouts would have affected the commercial viability of mines particularly mining and platinum mines mineral council spokeswoman charmane russell said
attempts by miners to produce their own power are expensive as eskom requires them to connect to the grid for a fee
the variety of legal codes found at the energy regulator and energy ministry are additional hurdles to independent power generation they say
the volume of electricity consumed by the industry is also too much to rely solely on
we need to fix eskom to think that underground gold mining can survive without eskom is going to be difficult said peter steenkamp the chief executive of gold miner harmony
however a few companies have succeeded in cutting dependency on the grid
petrochemicals firm sasol produces percent of its electricity needs to power its sprawling plants
power generation from steam turbines commissioned in and contracted with eskom via a power purchase programme helped to alleviate eskom s shortages at the time sasol said
but companies such as sibanye are struggling to do the same
the precious metals producer has pushed back plans unveiled in to build a solar plant because of difficulty in getting finance for the project and bureaucracy related to connecting to the national power grid
harmony gold has also been trying to build a megawatt solar plant
amplats said it was also considering building a megawatt solar power plant at the group s mogalakwena mine
