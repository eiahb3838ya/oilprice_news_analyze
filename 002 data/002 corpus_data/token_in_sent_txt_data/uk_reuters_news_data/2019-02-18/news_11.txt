column-u.s. may have overshot in china trade talks: kemp
london reuters brinkmanship has been one of the defining characteristics of the trump administration as the white house ramps up pressure to create a sense of crisis and force negotiating partners to make concessions
the administration has employed the same tactics in trade negotiations with canada mexico south korea and the european union as well as with the congress for border security funding with varied results
in china s case however the administration may have missed its moment of maximum leverage back in and as a result may have to settle for a less ambitious deal
leverage is always relative and at the end of the third quarter china s economy was showing signs of strain while the economy and markets were at the top of a growth cycle
since then china s economy has remained under pressure but the economy and financial markets have also started to show signs of slackening momentum
global trade flows and manufacturing activity have shown even clearer indications that the rate of growth decelerated in the fourth quarter and early
back in the administration could have risked imposing punitive tariffs on china and hoped to weather the economic fallout while waiting for china to capitulate
but the economic and financial market situation is now much more fragile and punitive tariffs would threaten to tip the domestic and international economies into a recession
concern about the consequences of failing to reach a deal by the deadline of march set by the president appears to be making both sides more eager for some form of accord even if it is an incomplete or interim one
news reports based on leaks from inside the talks process suggest the two sides have been inching towards an interim understanding despite remaining far apart on some of the most contentious issues
the talks may have to settle for a partial agreement in which the two sides reach agreements on farm and energy trade goods and services but leave tougher issues on intellectual property technology transfers subsidies and enterprises to be settled later
hardliners in the united states have been upping the pressure on the administration not to settle for anything less than a comprehensive deal that transforms china s economy and ensures fair trade
for maximalists the risk of cyclical damage in the form of a recession is worth taking to ensure structural gains and entrench technology and economic leadership
for the white house however structural objectives must be balanced against recession risk and an inexorable political cycle that has presidential and congressional elections less than months away and primaries less than months away
the administration is likely to put the economy at the centre of its campaign in and a cyclical downturn would complicate that narrative
a broad range of economic and financial indicators show the rate of expansion peaking at the end of the third quarter or early in the fourth before slowing significantly the slowdown has been even more marked outside the united states with global manufacturers reporting export orders falling since september and the decline is accelerating
air freight through hong kong is falling at the fastest rate for seven years according to data from the special administrative region s civil aviation department
container trade volumes through major cargo hubs including singapore los angeles and long beach all show a sharp slowdown in the second half of and into
the rebound in equity markets and steadying of consumer and business sentiment over the last month have been largely attributed to hopes that the trade negotiators will reach a deal or at least postpone tariff increases
top policymakers including the president have fuelled financial market optimism by describing positive progress made in the talks and the hopeful sentiment has spilled over into commodities such as oil
markets are banking on a deal even a limited incomplete one or a talks extension to keep the and global economies growing and avoid a slide into recession
as a result the economic outlook has become deeply entwined with the fate of the trade negotiations which has reduced the leverage of negotiators
china would undoubtedly take a severe economic hit if the talks fail and punitive tariffs go into effect but the united states might be hit even harder in relative if not absolute terms
china s currency hit a low against the dollar at the end of october and has since appreciated significantly in a measure of shifting relative economic performance
the administration can not be sure tariffs would not push the economy into a recession for which it would likely be blamed which makes brinkmanship very risky
the administration has a mixed track record on brinkmanship securing some gains but also miscalculating the determination and resilience of its opponents in some cases
no one can be certain that the white house will not choose to risk recession by refusing anything less than an ambitious deal
uncertainty is the essence of brinkmanship
but both the united states and china and specifically their top leaders have a lot to lose if the talks fail which is the main reason they are likely to succeed even if the price is deferring some of the harder issues until later
