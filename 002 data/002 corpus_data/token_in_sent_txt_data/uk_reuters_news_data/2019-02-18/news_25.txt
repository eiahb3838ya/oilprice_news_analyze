norway starts payments to indonesia for cutting forest emissions
kuala lumpur feb thomson reuters foundation almost a decade after norway signed a deal with indonesia to help protect its tropical forests the first payment for reduced emissions will be made after deforestation rates fell environmentalists and government officials said
indonesia imposed a moratorium on under the climate deal with payments linked to the southeast asian nation s progress on lowering emissions from felling trees which release carbon when they rot or are burned
indonesian environment and forestry minister siti nurbaya bakar and norwegian climate and environment minister ola elvestuen agreed the first payments would be made after deforestation rates dropped in according to a statement issued on saturday by the norwegian embassy in jakarta
no details were provided on the payment amount although green groups estimate the figure to be about million
it is a big deal because it reflects the fact that indonesia has turned a corner and that is great news for all of us said oyvind eggen director of the rainforest foundation norway
we want to see from indonesia that this is a trend and not a event he told the thomson reuters foundation
home to the world s tropical forests indonesia is also the biggest producer of palm oil
environmentalists blame much of the forest destruction on land clearance for plantations
deforestation and forest fires continue to blight many parts of the country while revisions to the moratorium have lacked transparency environmental campaigners say
by november indonesia s forest moratorium covered an area of more than million hectares million acres
in an attempt to tackle its annual haze from fires on deforested land indonesia switched its focus from containment to prevention after a particularly bad outbreak in that cost the country billion and left more than people suffering respiratory ailments
the fires in were one of the key reasons we are moving now said forest expert eggen on the climate deal s progress
there had been a shift in political will and greater transparency from indonesia over the last four years he noted
indonesia confirmed on saturday that carbon emissions from deforestation declined in
once independently verified payments for about million tonnes of avoided emissions will be made the norwegian embassy statement said
new measures introduced by the indonesian government including a ban on destroying primary forests and peatlands and limiting palm oil expansion were critical said norwegian minister elvestuen
future under the billion deal would be made when further deforestation progress was proven eggen said
he urged jakarta to strengthen and extend its moratorium to include secondary forests areas that have been cleared but where woody vegetation has again taken over
of forestry concessions with a high deforestation risk a more transparent approach and protecting the interests of indigenous people were also key eggen said
the commitment is there but now it depends clearly on whether indonesia continues to reduce deforestation he added
