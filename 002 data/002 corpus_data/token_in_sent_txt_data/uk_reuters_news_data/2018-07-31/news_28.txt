exclusive-south africa faces power cuts as eskom units down - internal report
johannesburg reuters south africa faces power cuts with units down at nine eskom stations taking over megawatts or percent of the utility s output off the national grid an internal document seen by reuters showed on tuesday
eskom provides more than percent of the power for africa s most industrialised economy but the utility has been hit by labour unrest over wage talks as it tries to reverse a decade of financial decline by cutting costs
the power utility said later on tuesday it had implemented controlled electricity cuts from gmt to citing a shortage of capacity after power supply was affected by labour unrest by workers who are demanding higher wages
power cuts during the ongoing winter are likely to cause hardship for millions
the document sent on tuesday to senior staff of the struggling utility shows that four units are down at the arnot station contradicting an earlier claim by eskom that only one of the six units there was not functioning
reasons cited for the outages at the units in total include an ongoing wildcat strike and low coal levels which union sources say are related to the industrial unrest along the coal belt east of johannesburg
eleven of the units went down on monday and tuesday underscoring the impact of the protests
the other four went down months ago or last year for reasons unrelated to the protests
only two of the units both at arnot are expected to come back on line on tuesday according to the document
nine are expected to start generating power again this week
employees at the arnot station on tuesday were prevented from showing up to work by striking colleagues according to eskom and union sources
the threat of protests and outages had appeared to recede after eskom offered to raise salaries by around percent annually over the next three years but trade unions want bonuses to be paid before they agree a wage deal
eskom which has a total national output of mw was forced to implement controlled electricity outages in after workers protested over wages
previously eskom implemented such measures known locally as load shedding in denting economic output
last week eskom said it was considering cutting staff and selling assets after swinging to a million loss which underlined the gravity of its financial position
south africa s new president cyril ramaphosa replaced eskom s entire board and top executives in january in a bid to revive a crucial state enterprise
