solar panel glut is muting effect of trump tariffs -sunpower
reuters a steep global decline in the price of solar modules in recent weeks is nearly offsetting the effect of the trump administration s percent tariff on imported panels the chief executive of a major solar company said on monday
while the price drop is trimming the profit margins of manufacturers it is welcome news for purchasers of solar systems who had been facing higher prices since the tariffs went into effect in february
if you are building a large power plant your pricing has certainly come back at least halfway to what it was if not all the way tom werner the ceo of sunpower corp said in an interview following the company s financial results announcement
it s muting the impact of solar module prices are down about percent globally since china announced changes to its incentives for solar power on june that have led to an oversupply of panels that had been intended for installation in china the world s largest solar market
sunpower is both a manufacturer of solar panels and an installer of solar power systems
the san jose company makes its products primarily in the philippines and mexico and is seeking an exclusion from the tariffs
sunpower makes panels and werner told analysts on a conference call that the company was responding to the price declines and would not allow its premium to expand
the company is in the process of buying rival solarworld americas expanding its domestic manufacturing in oregon to stem the impact of the tariffs
the price decline makes domestic manufacturing that much more challenging werner said adding that sunpower was committed to closing its deal to acquire solarworld
we re going to have to increase scale to compete he said
sunpower expects to spend million on tariffs in the second half of this year an amount the company would prefer to invest in its technology and scaling up its manufacturing werner said on a conference call with analysts
sunpower reported a loss and revenue that topped estimates due to strength in its rooftop solar business and cost controls
the company also said it would begin manufacturing its technology later this year
sunpower s stock was up percent at in trade
