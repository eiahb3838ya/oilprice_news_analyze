u.s. sees little impact from keystone xl pipeline's planned route
washington july reuters the keystone xl crude oil pipeline project cleared a hurdle on monday as the trump administration said in a draft environmental assessment that an alternative route through nebraska would not do major harm to water and wildlife
the state department s assessment of a plan for an alternative route through nebraska submitted by transcanada corp the company trying to complete the pipeline said keystone xl s cumulative effects would be minor to moderate on issues including water and biological resources
it said the pipeline would have only minor impacts on cultural resources such as native american graves
the nebraska public service commission approved the pipeline but not transcanada s preferred path
the alternative route will cost transcanada millions of dollars more than its original route
the billion pipeline that would transport heavy crude from canada s oilsands in alberta to steele city nebraska has been fought by environmentalists and ranchers for more than a decade
canadian oil producers who face price discounts for their crude due to transportation bottlenecks support the project
transcanada did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the draft assessment which will be open for days of public comment by the state department before being finalized
transcanada plans to start preliminary work in montana in coming months and full construction in according a letter sent in april from the state department to native american tribes
former president barack obama rejected the pipeline in saying it would mainly benefit canadian oil producers
president donald trump s state department approved the pipeline last year based on an environmental impact statement from that environmentalists said was outdated
the sierra club an environmental group said the state department was attempting a short cut to get the project built and a full review is required that considers changes in oil prices and market forces
keystone is a threat to our land water wildlife communities and climate and we will continue fighting in the courts and in the streets to ensure that it is never built said kelly martin the director of sierra club s beyond dirty fuels campaign
the state department said it could not comment on the new assessment due to ongoing litigation
