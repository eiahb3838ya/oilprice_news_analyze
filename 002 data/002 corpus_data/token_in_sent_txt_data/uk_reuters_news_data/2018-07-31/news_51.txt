geneva reuters the united nations human rights office called on saudi arabia on tuesday to release all peaceful activists including women held for campaigning against a ban on driving even as it was being lifted
at least government critics were arrested since some of whose whereabouts are unknown amid a serious lack of transparency in the processing of their cases the rights office said
they included prominent women s rights advocate hatoon arrested in june as she was planning to take journalists in her car to celebrate the end of the world s last ban on female drivers long seen as an emblem of repression in the deeply conservative muslim country
we urge the government of saudi arabia to unconditionally release all human rights defenders and activists who have been detained for their peaceful human rights work including their campaigns for the lifting of the driving ban for women human rights spokeswoman ravina shamdasani said
crown prince mohammed bin salman the heir to the throne set to become the first saudi king from a new generation after a succession of six brothers dating back to has initiated broad reforms to diversify the economy from oil and update deeply conservative social norms
but critics say the reforms have not extended into politics in an absolute monarchy where all public opposition to the authorities is still banned
genuine reforms appear to be taking place in the kingdom but this has not extended to the civil and political rights sphere shamsadani told a geneva news briefing dissent criticism of the government is still not accepted in the country
that can explain why many of these human rights defenders and activists have been jailed
all of them have criticised government policies in one way or another she said
