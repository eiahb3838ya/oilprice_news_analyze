iran rejects trump offer of talks as "humiliation", without value
pullout from nuclear pact illegal president trump untrustworthy so talks wouldn t work minister engaging trump would be humiliation moderate mp trump targets iranian oil after pullout from nuclear pact iran won t easily cede right to export oil rouhani says by bozorgmehr sharafedin london july reuters senior iranian officials on tuesday rejected president donald trump s offer of talks without preconditions as worthless and a humiliation after he acted to reimpose sanctions on tehran following his withdrawal from a landmark nuclear deal
separately iranian president hassan rouhani said trump s repudiation of the accord reached in was illegal and iran would not easily yield to washington s renewed campaign to strangle iran s vital oil exports
in may trump pulled the united states out of the multilateral deal concluded before he took office denouncing it as in iran s favour
on monday he declared that he would be willing to meet rouhani without preconditions to discuss how to improve relations
the head of iran s strategic council on foreign relations said on tuesday tehran saw no worth in trump s offer made only a week after he warned iran it risked dire consequences few had ever suffered in history if it made threats against washington
based on our bad experiences in negotiations with america and based on officials violation of their commitments it is natural that we see no value in his proposal kamal kharrazi was quoted as saying by the fars news agency
trump should first make up for his withdrawal from the nuclear deal and show that he respects his predecessors commitments and international law added kharrazi a former foreign minister
the council was set up by iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei to help formulate policies for the islamic republic
trump s move to force iran into fresh negotiations has for now reunited iranian hardliners who opposed the nuclear deal and moderates like rouhani who championed it to end the islamic republic s economically crippling with western powers
ali motahari the deputy speaker of iran s parliament who is seen as part of iran s moderate camp said that to negotiate with trump now would be a humiliation
if trump had not withdrawn from the nuclear deal and not imposed new sanctions on iran there would be no problem with negotiations with america he told state news agency irna
iran s interior minister chimed in that tehran did not trust washington as a negotiating partner
the united states is not trustworthy
how can we trust this country when it withdraws unilaterally from the nuclear deal abdolreza rahmani fazli was quoted as saying by the fars news agency
a senior aide to rouhani said the only way back to talks was for washington to return to the nuclear agreement
respecting the iranian nation s rights reducing hostilities and returning to the nuclear deal are steps that can be taken to pave the bumpy road of talks between iran and america hamid aboutalebi tweeted on tuesday
under the deal the fruit of rouhani s efforts to ease iran s international isolation to help revive its economy iran curbed its shadowy nuclear programme and won relief from and western sanctions in return
trump condemned the deal in part because it did not cover iran s ballistic missile programme and involvement in middle east conflicts
he reactivated sanctions the most measures against iran and warned countries to stop importing iranian oil from or risk penalties
the three major european signatories to the deal have been searching for ways to salvage it but cautioned tehran that they may not be able to persuade many major investors not to bolt from business with iran to avoid punishment
rouhani said during a meeting with britain s ambassador on tuesday that after what he called the illegal withdrawal from the nuclear deal the ball is in europe s court now
he added the islamic republic has never sought tension in the region and does not want any trouble in global waterways but it will not easily give up on its rights to export rouhani and some senior military commanders have said iran could disrupt oil shipments from gulf states through the strait of hormuz if washington tries to choke off iranian oil exports
reiterating tehran s official stance iranian navy commander rear admiral hossein khanzadi was quoted as saying by tasnim news agency on tuesday that the strait would remain open if iran s national interests are preserved
iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili told reuters on tuesday that trump was mistaken to expect saudi arabia and other oil producers to compensate for losses of iranian oil caused by sanctions
it seems president trump has been taken hostage by saudi arabia and a few producers when they claimed they can replace million barrels per day of iranian exports encouraging him to take action against iran ardebili said
now they and russia sell more oil and more expensively
not even from their incremental production but their he said oil prices which trump has been pressuring the organization of the petroleum exporting countries to bring down by raising output will instead rise unless the united states grants waivers to buyers of iranian crude
iran s currency plumbed new depths on monday dropping past rials to the dollar but trump s expressed willingness to negotiate with tehran sparked a minor recovery on tuesday to rials on the unofficial market
iranian eshagh jahangiri said the government and the central bank would unveil a new economic plan by the end of this week to tackle the sanctions and the rial s fall
videos on social media showed hundreds of people rallying in isfahan in central iran in protest at high prices caused in part by the rial s devaluation under heightened pressure
