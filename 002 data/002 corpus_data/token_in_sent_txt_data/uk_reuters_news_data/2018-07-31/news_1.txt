update 1-u.s. says it expects n.korea to uphold promise to give up nuclear arms
washington reuters the state department said on tuesday it expects pyongyang to keep its commitment made at a june leaders summit to give up its nuclear arms and would press southeast asian nations during meetings this week to maintain sanctions against north korea
questions have arisen over pyongyang s commitment to denuclearize after spy satellite material detected renewed activity at the north korean factory that produced the country s first intercontinental ballistic missiles icbms capable of reaching the united states
the department left open the possibility that secretary of state mike pompeo could meet north korean officials during meetings of the association of southeast asian nations asean bloc in singapore this weekend
we will be in some of the same meetings as north korean officials
i certainly can t preclude any interaction taking place but we have no meetings on the schedule state department spokeswoman heather nauert told reporters
another state department official who earlier briefed reporters on pompeo s trip to singapore malaysia and indonesia this week said the secretary would remind asean to adhere to sanctions against pyongyang
there are concerns that fuel is being sold illegally to north korea despite sanctions the official said
the official said that north korea will participate in a regional asean forum on saturday that pompeo will also attend
we remain concerned about the scale of north korea s illicit procurement in particular of refined petroleum products via transfers the official said
under the restrictions pyongyang is limited to importing million barrels of crude and barrels of products a year
pompeo has led talks with pyongyang to denuclearize following a june summit between north korean leader kim jong un and president donald trump
nauert said the united states was holding kim to the commitment he made during the summit to denuclearize
she declined to comment on the spy satellite images
what we are going on is the commitment that chairman kim made to our president and that is the commitment to denuclearize
that is something that we certainly anticipate that he will hold up his end of the bargain nauert said
one photo image showed a truck and covered trailer similar to those the north has used to move its icbms
since the trailer was covered it was not possible to know what if anything it was carrying
photos and infrared imaging however indicate vehicles moving in and out of the facility at sanumdong but do not show how advanced any missile construction might be
the evidence obtained this month is the latest to suggest ongoing activity in north korea s nuclear and missile facilities
trump declared soon after the summit that north korea no longer posed a nuclear threat
