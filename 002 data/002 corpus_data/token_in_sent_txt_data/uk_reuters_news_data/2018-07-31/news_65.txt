china's renewable power waste falls, but warns of challenges
shanghai july reuters levels of wasted power in china s renewable sector fell in the first half of this year but securing grid access for many new clean energy projects remains a challenge for the industry an energy bureau official said
china s renewable energy capacity has soared thanks to generous subsidies and ambitious targets but the country does not have enough transmission capacity to deliver all the new power to customers a problem known as curtailment
to resolve the issue the government has been trying to adjust the timing of construction and has set up an early warning system forcing regions suffering from excess capacity growth to slow down the pace of new approvals
from this year the situation has improved said liang zhipeng of the renewable energy office of the national energy administration during a media briefing on monday
but absorbing renewable power remains a long term china s total renewable energy capacity reached gigawatts by the end of june up percent on the year accounting for nearly of total energy capacity
fuel power renewables and nuclear accounted for percent of china s new installed energy capacity in the first half up percentage points compared to a year earlier
wind curtailment rates stood at percent down percentage points on the year while solar curtailment also fell percentage points to percent during the first half
liang said new demand had created more favourable conditions for the renewable sector but it still faced big challenges
over the long term it is very important to establish an effective mechanism to absorb and utilise renewable energy he said
amid overcapacity fears china has already taken action to restrict the number of new solar power generation projects this year after record growth in
the state planning agency said at the end of june that it would cap new capacity at gw in compared to gw last year
