investors said the results and deal to buy quadrant energy in the state of western australia vindicated the firm s decision earlier this year to reject a billion takeover bid from private harbour energy
santos shares jumped as much as percent to a year high of a on thursday the same price harbour had offered for the firm and a level investors had not expected to be reached again so soon after that bid fell through
after rejecting harbour energy s bid earlier this year santos s management has had a point to prove to its shareholders that the company had emerged from survival mode and is ready to grow again
this deal certainly does that said wood mackenzie analyst daniel toleman
jpmorgan likened the acquisition to pulling a rabbit out of a hat while several analysts pointed to strong growth prospects with quadrant s dorado oil find off western australia
the synergies they can get out of full ownership of quadrant debt funding the whole thing it s a pretty accretive deal for them
i didn t expect it to happen said andy forster a portfolio manager at argo investments santos s shareholder
the company reported that underlying profit for the ended june rose to million from million a year earlier beating a royal bank of canada forecast of million
that came even as output was hit by an outage at the papua new guinea lng liquefied natural gas plant after an earthquake
santos declared an interim dividend of a share
it suspended dividends in diverting cash to pay down debt which had peaked for the construction of its gladstone lng project just as oil prices collapsed
it has since cut net debt to billion and said it was on course to get it below billion before the end of this year a year ahead of plan thanks to sharp and a rebound in oil and gas prices
we re fully funded to execute our growth programme and to be able to pay a sustainable dividend going forward santos chief executive kevin gallagher told reuters in an interview
the quadrant acquisition which gallagher said the company had been looking at for around a year is expected to boost the company s free cash flow by around percent in assuming oil prices of a barrel
santos said the cash generated from quadrant the biggest gas supplier to the domestic market in western australia will help fund expansions in northern australia and papua new guinea as well as servicing the billion in debt it is taking on for the deal
what it does do is it gives us more choice
now we have really good growth opportunities in all of our core assets gallagher said
the company s weak spot the gladstone lng project aims to reach output of million tonnes a year by the end of four years after opening
gallagher gave no estimate on when the project would hit its capacity of million tonnes
santos still expects production of million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe on growing output from its cooper basin assets and maintained its sales volume guidance of mmboe
