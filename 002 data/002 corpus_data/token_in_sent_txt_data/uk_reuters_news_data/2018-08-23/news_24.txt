canada should bring in stronger rail cars for crude before 2025 -official
montreal reuters canada ought to require stronger tank cars for transporting flammable liquids sooner than the current deadline in transportation safety board chair kathy fox said on thursday noting that shipments are expected to rise in the country
we understand that it can t happen all at once
but we d like to see it sooner fox said in an interview without giving a specific alternative date
we do have an ongoing concern that flammable liquids be transported in the most robust tank canada and the united states have introduced new requirements to more safely transport flammable liquids after a runaway train explosion carrying crude killed in the canadian province of quebec
older cars used during the tragedy in lac megantic quebec have already been replaced in canada by cars for moving crude oil but even these must be completely phased out by may for the transport of flammable liquids according to the tsb
they will need to be replaced by cars or retrofits that meet the same standard which has thicker steel
the department of transportation expects flammable liquids to be carried in comparable rail tank cars or retrofits by may
canada has not experienced a major derailment of a crude train since fox said
but in the united states a bnsf railway co freight train carrying crude oil derailed in northwest iowa in june sending some gallons of oil into a state waterway
transports which have declined in canada in recent years on declining oil prices are showing signs of a resurgence
canada exported a record barrels per day of crude by rail in june the national energy board said on wednesday as oil shippers coped with congested pipelines
that volume jumped percent from a year earlier but expanding oil producers have said they need to move much more to reduce a steep discount on their heavy crude prices
recommendations following lac megantic have led to improved oversight and standards for tank cars fox said
but she remains concerned over a recent rise in uncontrolled train movements that could be prevented with better training less reliance on air or hand brakes and improved physical defences
we re encouraged to see the progress made since lac megantic she said
but there is still more work to be additional reporting by rod nickel in winnipeg editing by david gregorio
