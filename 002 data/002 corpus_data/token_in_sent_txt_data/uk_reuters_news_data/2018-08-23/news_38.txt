explainer-in the race to bag iran's european oil market share, quality is king
london reuters two of iran s biggest opec rivals saudi arabia and iraq are bagging its european oil market share by cranking up production of their lookalike crude grades before the restart of sanctions designed to halt exports from the islamic republic
iran faces curbs on its energy sector from early november after president donald trump walked away in may from a deal aimed at restraining tehran s nuclear program
iran s crude is mainly bought by refiners in china india japan and south korea although it has customers in turkey and the european union
buyers seeking an alternative can not simply opt for any crude on the market
as oil sanctions against iran take effect perhaps in combination with production problems elsewhere maintaining global supply might be very challenging and would come at the expense of maintaining an adequate spare capacity cushion the international energy agency warned recently
thus the market outlook could be far less calm at that point than it is today the iea said
a senior iranian diplomat told producer group opec on that no member country should be allowed to take over another s share of oil exports in light of saudi arabia s offer to produce more to cover any iranian shortfalls
but a look at trade flows shows that in europe at least saudi arabia and iraq have already succeeded in doing so
since the start of the year iranian flows to europe have fallen percent to around barrels per day bpd while saudi shipments have doubled and those from iraq have risen percent according to reuters flows and data
saudi basra urals one refiner said when asked what crude grades were likely alternatives the latter two hailing from iraq and russia respectively
iraq and saudi arabia have raised their oil output by a combined bpd since the start of the year and cut the official selling prices for their light crudes for customers in asia
iran is the world s oil exporter and with as much as million bpd of supply estimated to be under threat its customers may be forced to pay handsomely for possible replacements
crude oil is categorized mainly according to sulfur content and its density relative to water or american petroleum institute gravity
the denser crude is the lower its gravity
crudes that have an api gravity above degrees are categorized as light while those with api gravity between and degrees are medium and below degrees heavy
the lighter the crude the easier and cheaper it is to extract and transport and the simpler it is to refine
heavier crudes which contain more impurities such as sulfur or metals require additional processing to recover products
sulfur content is a second key category
a sweet crude is one with a sulfur content of less than percent while the sulfur content of a sour crude is above this threshold
sulfur is corrosive and refineries that run more sour grades require more intense maintenance
the average api for opec s crudes is compared with an average of for grades
shale the type of crude is lighter still

most refineries worldwide are tooled to run crudes with an api of according to one source at a major european refiner

graphic major international crude oil grades the impact on the more sour crudes is already apparent
prices for physical barrels oil have generally declined over the second half of this year but russian urals british forties and angolan girassol all sour are the grades from around the atlantic basin having lost around percent
that compares with losses of percent for lighter sweeter crudes such as norwegian ekofisk or nigeria s bonny light
