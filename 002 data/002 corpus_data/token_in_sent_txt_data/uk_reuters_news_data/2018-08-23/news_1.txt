equinor sees scope to cut more costs at giant north sea oilfield
johan sverdrup set to start production in late at peak could make up pct of total norway petroleum output no other giant oilfield found off norway since sverdrup by nerijus adomaitis johan sverdrup platform north sea aug reuters n orway s equinor sees scope to further reduce development costs at the johan sverdrup oilfield in the north sea as it looks to maximise the potential of what could be the last giant field to be found off the nordic country
the field one of the five largest oil finds offshore norway is estimated to contain up to billion barrels of oil equivalents mainly crude oil enough to meet britain s oil demand for five years
sverdrup is on track to begin production in late and could produce up to a quarter of norway s overall petroleum output at its peak
equinor formerly statoil has already cut development costs by billion crowns billion to billion crowns thanks to more efficient drilling and smooth execution that meant cash put aside for contingencies has not been used
i think there are still some further gains on the cost side margareth oevrum equinor s executive president for technology project and drilling told reuters
oevrum was speaking at the sverdrup drilling platform one of two already in place in the north sea some km miles west of the norwegian coast
workers were connecting pipes laying cables and testing equipment in heavy wind and rain part of the staff currently offshore to complete construction
the remaining two platforms are expected to be delivered to the field in spring
during the first stage of development sverdrup is expected to produce up to barrels of oil equivalents per day boepd while the second phase scheduled to start in is expected to boost output to boepd
equinor is expected to submit a plan for the field s second phase estimated to cost a preliminary billion crowns later this month
going forward this will be the biggest oilfield producing on the norwegian continental shelf said oevrum
sverdrup s significance in terms of oil output could be even higher
oil pricing agency s p global platts has said output from the field would be suitable for its north sea basket making it potentially a sixth crude underpinning the brent benchmark used to price most global oil
the field also helped sustain demand for industry suppliers during the oil downturn with equinor and partners lundin petroleum aker bp petoro and total awarding contracts worth over billion crowns
i lost my job when the oil crisis came and i got it back when this project started so i am very happy said stian simonsen a pipe fitter working at sverdrup
the field is named after a century norwegian prime minister
but there may not be another sverdrup to help the norwegian oil industry in the years ahead
i can t see anything larger for the future we have johan castberg but it s not as big as johan sverdrup oevrum said referring to equinor s oilfield development in the arctic
we are still positive about exploration and will explore more but at the moment we don t have oevrum herself will soon leave norway for brazil to supervise the development of the carcara discovery which is of a similar size to sverdrup
while norway still accounts for about of equinor s total petroleum output its international operations have been hitting new quarterly records
the norwegian continental shelf has been the backbone of equinor for many years and it will continue for some time but it will be gradually replaced by the international production oevrum said
