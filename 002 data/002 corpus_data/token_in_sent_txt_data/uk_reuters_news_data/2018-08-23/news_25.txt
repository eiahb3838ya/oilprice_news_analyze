update 10-oil stabilizes, weighed down by trade war
new york reuters oil prices steadied on thursday as the escalating trade war between the united states and china weighed on demand expectations a day after prices jumped on a big draw in crude inventories
brent crude oil settled down cents at a barrel
light crude was cents lower at a barrel
options activity showed some traders were guarding against the possibility of a sharp slide in crude prices
the market is trying to balance the worries about decreased global demand growth and how much extra oil the saudis and russians are going to put on said gene mcgillian director of market research at tradition energy in stamford connecticut
still he said prices drew support from the draw in crude inventories reported on wednesday by the energy information administration eia
there s a better fundamental picture than a year ago he said
the trade dispute deepened with the imposition of percent tariffs on billion worth of each other s goods
the world s two largest economies have imposed tariffs on a combined billion of products since early july and washington is holding hearings on proposed duties on another billion worth of chinese imports
china is almost certain to respond
the trade war is expected to shave up to percentage points from china s real gdp growth in said moody s investor service adding it should cut percentage point from projected real gdp growth to percent in the dispute has already led analysts to trim forecasts for energy consumption though some markets remain tight
commercial crude oil inventories fell million barrels last week the eia said on wednesday more than three times forecasts
this week s report was bullish for crude said societe generale oil analyst michael wittner
crude stocks drew due to sharply lower crude imports and refinery crude the eia also said oil production was rising reaching million barrels per day last week
that means the world s three top producers russia the united states and saudi arabia now all pump around million bpd meeting a third of global demand
in options activity december puts for oil at a barrel traded though the volume was thin with just a few hundred contracts exchanged said bob yawger director of futures at mizuho in new york
the fact that someone even thought it was possible to get there is interesting yawger said
to get to it would need to get ugly between now and volume on the options at a barrel remained much lower than options in a range closer to the current level
