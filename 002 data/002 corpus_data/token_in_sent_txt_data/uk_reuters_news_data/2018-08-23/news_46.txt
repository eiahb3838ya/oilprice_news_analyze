neste keeps faith with renewable jet fuel business despite setback
helsinki reuters biofuel producer and oil refiner neste sees good opportunities for its renewable jet fuel despite a cancelled pilot project in switzerland a company executive said
the finnish company is hoping to get a boost for its biofuels business in the coming years from proposed reductions of emissions in aviation
the pilot project was due to replace at least percent of jet fuel used at geneva airport with neste s biofuel until swiss authorities earlier this week told neste they had decided not to back the scheme
neste had considered the geneva project as an important step in ramping up its aviation business but the head of its renewable products kaisa hietala told reuters the cancellation would not affect neste s plans
it was surprising a disappointment but we have other partners to proceed with and there are more coming in the pipeline she said
neste has recently announced similar projects with dallas airport in the united states as well as american airlines and the product has already been tested by boeing and lufthansa
at the moment what holds back this market is high price and availability
but when the market is created there will be more interest hietala said
she added neste s plan to expand its biofuel production in singapore would enable it to provide sufficient volumes for the aviation market
production at the new line is due to begin in
the international civil aviation organization is targeting growth in aviation from hietala noted
aviation is a global business that grows at a fast pace
reliability of delivery for the fuel will be an important alongside neste at least one other company altair fuels has tested biofuel for aircraft with pilot projects
neste has stepped up usage of feedstock in its biofuels waste and residue inputs such as animal fats make up more than percent of its raw materials
in the first half of biofuels for road traffic made percent of neste s core profit of million euros million pounds
aviation might become a significant source of income for us in the future hietala said
