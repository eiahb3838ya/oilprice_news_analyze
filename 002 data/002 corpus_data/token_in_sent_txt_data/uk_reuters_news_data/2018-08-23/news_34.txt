insight-imitate vaxjo? as heat rises, swedish city goes green - and thrives
vaxjo sweden reuters ringed by forests in southern sweden the city of vaxjo is thriving even as it cuts greenhouse gas emissions at rates more typical of economic crashes in recessions or wars
it is a radical example of tackling climate change by cutting the use of fossil fuels offering a glimpse of how the world could stay within warming limits which scientists say are needed to avoid significant environmental damage
vaxjo s power plant runs on biomass from timber
in winter snow plows clear bicycle paths before roads to discourage cars and political parties all back a target of making the city free by to eliminate carbon dioxide emissions from oil natural gas and coal
around the world governments are struggling to meet their various pledges to cut emissions under the paris climate agreement amid unease about heat waves droughts and wildfires that have raged this summer from greece to california
leading climate scientists are set to warn governments in october that global carbon emissions from energy use will have to plunge by up to seven percent a year to meet paris toughest goals unless they develop technologies to suck carbon from the air according to a draft report obtained by reuters
extreme falls are usually known only from world wars the great depression or in russia where emissions plunged percent in the year after the collapse of the soviet union
emerging economies led by china and india are all raising energy use to end poverty and developed countries are wary of sacrificing growth for the environment
what works in a city in a rich stable nordic democracy is not an easy blueprint
still isolated examples like vaxjo a city of inhabitants where the red medieval cathedral contrasts with wooden buildings are intriguing for policymakers since it has cut emissions and continued to grow
bo frank president of the city council and an architect of the green shift said his advice boiled down to heavy heavy tax increase on fossil energy and reduce the tax on all kinds of renewable per capita vaxjo says carbon dioxide emissions have fallen by percent from to tonnes from while local gross domestic product gdp rose percent from according to the latest available figures
the trajectory is uneven but equates to an annual rate of emissions cuts of percent with percent growth
by contrast worldwide carbon emissions rose by two percent last year to a record high of almost five tonnes per capita according to scientists who compile a global carbon vaxjo aims to eliminate carbon emissions from fossil fuels by in homes industry and transport including planes taking off from the local airport
it says its accounting follows guidelines treating the municipality as if it were a
the city estimates that carbon dioxide from fossil fuels accounts for percent of the municipality s greenhouse gases
vaxjo has cut other gases such as methane and nitrous oxide by percent since but has not yet set deadlines for phasing them out
thanks to the early green start vaxjo s carbon cuts are far ahead of the timetable set by almost nations in the paris climate agreement to phase out net emissions of all greenhouse gases sometime from
sweden as a whole has also cut emissions while sustaining strong economic growth
the country of million tops international environmental rankings and imposes the world s highest carbon tax of up to euros a tonne
the notion that a carbon tax is harmful for the economy in any country is a political notion
not a factual notion said swedish environment minister karolina skog of the green party
the burning of biomass also emits carbon dioxide but can be made carbon neutral by planting new forests as in vaxjo which absorb the gas to grow
almost no countries have forests covering of the country like sweden but skog noted that all nations have some form of renewable energy such as solar or wind power
the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd says sweden produces of gdp for every kilo of carbon emissions almost three times the average for rich nations of
skog cited companies like furniture group ikea which aims to be climate positive by to show that strong environmental goals do not undermine profits but said we have not yet completely decoupled our economy from carbon emissions
the nation s greenhouse gas emissions fell percent between but the rate of decline has slowed in recent years rolf lindahl of greenpeace said sweden was doing better than most but not enough in terms of phasing out fossil fuels
wildfires have made the environment a big issue in elections due on with most parties pledging tougher action on climate change
the sweden democrats who oppose sweden taking a global lead in cutting greenhouse gas emissions because of fears it could slow the economy are expected to make the biggest gains with an expected fifth of the vote
but mainstream parties on left and right have ruled out cooperating with them
the paris agreement set a goal of limiting the rise in average global temperatures to well below two degrees celsius above times while pursuing efforts for
temperatures are already up by about
as part of the paris deal world leaders asked scientists to write a report about ways to achieve the goal a goal that many experts say is unrealistic
the draft by the s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc to be unveiled in south korea in october acknowledges there is no documented historical precedent to limit warming to but outlines four possible ways to do it
three rely heavily on unproven technologies for extracting carbon dioxide from nature and burying it
a low energy demand led scenario is the only one to focus solely on rapid cuts in emissions and an acceleration of planting forests to absorb more greenhouse gases
arnulf gruebler of the international institute for applied systems analysis in vienna the lead author of the led said the rise of the internet in recent years showed that new technologies can abruptly transform economies
smart phones for instance could reduce energy demand if they replace cameras radios telephones clocks televisions and music players rather than being an extra gadget
but many say the led scenario is also
christian azar a professor of energy and the environment at chalmers university in gothenburg said it would probably require unpopular restrictions on driving flying even diets
i don t think that s going to happen he said
president donald trump who says he doubts climate change is primarily driven by emissions plans to pull out of the paris agreement asserting that it will undermine the economy
so far the deepest national cuts in emissions delivered by peacetime policies according to a study in the journal nature climate change were percent a year in sweden from after oil price spikes drove the nation to adopt nuclear power
spurred by the oil shocks vaxjo was one of the first swedish cities to build a district heating plant run on biomass in pumping hot water around the city and generating electricity
after the oil crises we realized we live virtually in the woodshed said henrik johansson environmental coordinator at vaxjo municipality
it was a local forest owners producing timber earned extra money from selling waste branches sawdust and bark to fuel the new power plant
the forest owners then paid more taxes enriching the municipality
overall sweden s green shift was eased by a lack of a strong oil or coal lobby even though it does have a big steel industry and car makers such as volvo
in vaxjo buses run on biogas bus routes are altered to stop at new housing developments even before they are built and changes to building codes are being planned to limit new parking spaces
the city is also upgrading insulation in older buildings and has decreed that percent of all new municipal buildings will be made of wood by
an urban garden near the center grows tomatoes squash pumpkins and sunflowers
sweden s local municipalities have huge power raising taxes and spending about percent of all public money on everything from education to pensions
in sweden we have very high taxes and we are also the most decentralized country in the world
so what i say happens said mayor anna tenje of the ruling mainstream conservative moderate party
it is not always popular
frank president of the city council said vaxjo s strong line on the environment had led a satirical newspaper to describe him as the head of a green fascist state
and not everything is on track
gleaming new bicycle racks for commuters at vaxjo railway station were mostly empty one recent day
tenje said the biggest headache was persuading people in rural areas to forsake cars run on diesel or gasoline making the goal hard to reach
we will achieve the goal but maybe it won t be by she said
maybe it will take until swedish crowns additional reporting by niklas pollard in stockholm editing by philippa fletcher
