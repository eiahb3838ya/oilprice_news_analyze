australia faces increased blackout risks this summer as coal plants age
melbourne aug reuters the risk of blackouts in australia s upcoming summer has grown from last year as ageing power plants have become less reliable the nation s energy market operator said on friday calling for more power investment in the next few years
the australian energy market operator s aemo latest outlook underscores worries about the country s grid just days after the government s signature energy policy to boost power reliability lower emissions and cut prices collapsed amid political turmoil
close collaboration with industry in the lead up and throughout summer will be key to reducing the risks of energy supply shortfalls aemo managing director audrey zibelman said in a statement
australia s southeastern states suffered a string of blackouts in and the worst of which hit the entire state of south australia and shut global miner bhp s olympic dam copper mine for two weeks costing it million
aemo sees the states of victoria and south australia most at risk of outages in the summer which runs from december through february with some risk in the most populous state new south wales where a severe drought could deplete hydropower
electricity demand typically jumps over the summer as households and businesses crank up air conditioning
the bureau of meteorology has not issued its forecast for this summer yet but has said that temperatures this spring are likely to be warmer than average
the forecast risk of in has increased since the outlook primarily because modelling has now factored in a reduction in thermal generation reliability observed in recent years aemo said
unexpected outages at plants have forced australia s biggest power user the tomago aluminium smelter partly owned by rio tinto to cut output several times this year as it looked to avoid sharp price spikes when sydney was on the verge of blackouts
without shoring up reserves there would be a risk of involuntary during summer peak periods in victoria from this summer in new south wales from and in south australia from aemo said
aemo is repeating steps from last summer when it lined up supply and paid big energy users to cut energy use at times when the system was short on supply
as australia s ageing generators which supply more than percent of the market s electricity get closer to retiring starting in the market will need to find new sources beyond those already planned to avert outages
the results emphasise the need for an investment landscape which supports the development of the portfolio of resources required to replace retiring generation aemo said
