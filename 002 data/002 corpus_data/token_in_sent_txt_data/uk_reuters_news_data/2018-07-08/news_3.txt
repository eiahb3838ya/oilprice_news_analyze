corrected-daimler halts truck engine deliveries on emissions concerns
frankfurt reuters germany s daimler ag has temporarily halted deliveries of a truck engine after finding that in certain driving conditions its emissions of nitrogen oxide nox could exceed legal limits the company said on sunday
daimler responding to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper said it had informed germany s federal motor transport authority of the issue last month and was in a constructive dialogue
german automakers have been under intense scrutiny since the dieselgate scandal of in which volkswagen admitted to using illegal software steering its diesel engines to cheat emissions tests
volkswagen reached a settlement in the united states but the scandal continues to reverberate in germany where the head of its audi unit rupert stadler has been arrested in a separate investigation
daimler is also under scrutiny over how its diesel car engines use a urea nitrate additive called adblue to neutralise emissions of nitrogen oxide which can contribute to the formation of harmful smog and ozone
germany s transport ministry said last month that vehicles in europe had been found to contain unauthorised defeat devices and ordered daimler to recall cars in germany
in the latest case bild am sonntag reported that daimler had found during internal checks that software running the om truck engine would in certain circumstances stop the injection of adblue
in a statement daimler said the report was misleading and that the engine s diagnosis system was designed to manage the flow of adblue in unusual circumstances such as when the engine was running on biodiesel
this would prevent excessive injections of adblue leading to the release of ammonia which in high concentrations can act as a respiratory irritant
in the course of regulator tests daimler ag found isolated situations when a engine of the euro v standard slightly exceeded the relevant nox limits the company said
daimler said it had undertaken a detailed analysis of the findings and informed the federal motor transport authority at the end of june
the motor was sold in trucks in europe until and is currently on sale only outside europe
until the technical issues are clarified the company has taken a precautionary decision no longer to deliver this engine daimler said
