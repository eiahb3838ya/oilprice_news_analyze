update 1-moscow approves $29 bln power upgrade to encourage domestic suppliers
moscow reuters russia has approved the start of a trillion ruble billion modernization plan for domestic power plants energy minister alexander novak said on thursday
power is one of the most competitive sectors in russia with state players private investors and firms such as italy s enel finland s fortum and germany s uniper
the modernization covers gigawatts a sixth of russia s existing power plant capacity and will replace an earlier program where investors were given the opportunity to build the new capacity
investors will bid to take part in selected upgrades and granted agreements with customers who will pledge to pay higher prices in exchange to the access to the capacity
moscow will require them to use equipment for the upgrades which would involve replacement of turbines boilers units among other parts in up to percent of cases novak told reporters
using russian equipment may be a challenge
russia began building two power stations in crimea to provide electricity to the peninsula which it annexed from ukraine in but the facilities became embroiled in a row over sanctions
german engineering firm siemens has said russia clandestinely delivered several of its turbines to crimea despite european sanctions which ban the supply of energy technology to crimea
russia s energy ministry says the turbines were not from siemens but were modernized turbines that were the work of russian specialists and were russian equipment
russia partially launched both power stations in crimea last year but has delayed the timing for them to reach full capacity
tekhnopromeksport the engineering firm building the plants said last month it had requested the full launch be pushed back until spring citing issues with the supply of equipment and problems with subcontractors and infrastructure
russia wants the new program to be a catalyst for local producers including subsidiaries of foreign firms to create domestic versions of the global power sector equipment cutting moscow s reliance on western suppliers
