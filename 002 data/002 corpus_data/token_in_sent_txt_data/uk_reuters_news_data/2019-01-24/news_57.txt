london reuters bp said on thursday it had invested in chinese powershare which links electric vehicle drivers to charging points and helps power suppliers balance distribution
the powershare application which is used in cities such as shanghai will help manage growing pressure on power grids as electric vehicles evs usage surges in the coming decades
with china targeting sales of more than million evs by the need to manage demand and distribution of power on the grid particularly at times of peak demand will be crucial
bp s investment is the latest in a string by the oil and gas major and several of its rivals including royal dutch shell and total in ev charging as they target future economies
car producers utility firms and energy companies have doubled down efforts in recent years to find ways to manage the expected surge in power demand
powershare helps drivers locate charging points and pay for the supply while allowing suppliers to optimize to balance demand on the grid depending on the time of day for example between city centers and residential areas
as more and more evs come on grid operators are concerned about mobile demand
powershare can monitor where vehicles are and where demand is in the system graham howes managing director of bp ventures in asia told reuters
bp which has invested in battery docks and battery storage technologies did not disclose the size of the investment in powershare but its venturing business typically invests up to ten million dollars in one firm
we wanted to find a technology that can cope with volume howes said of powershare which is bp ventures first direct investment in china
