update 1-saudis to davos: move on from khashoggi, let's do business
davos switzerland reuters if you somehow missed the news about the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi by saudi agents and the global outcry that ensued you might think saudi arabia is the darling of the world economic forum in davos
the kingdom has sent one of its strongest delegations ever to the swiss mountain resort and packed its top executives agendas with meetings with international peers
it has managed to secure top western businessmen for a panel debate on next steps for saudi arabia where french oil major total s chief executive patrick pouyanne and morgan stanley s boss james gorman spoke alongside the saudi finance and economy ministers
the davos gathering in the swiss alps is a chance for the saudis to try to put behind them months of intense criticism over the murder of khashoggi a critic of crown prince mohammed bin salman inside the saudi consulate in istanbul in october
his killing by a team of saudi operatives provoked widespread revulsion and tarnished the image of the crown prince previously admired in the west for pushing deep changes including tax reform infrastructure projects and allowing women to drive
at davos the signs are that the damage control is working
swiss president ueli maurer said on wednesday his country has moved on and wanted to build strong relations with riyadh a rich kingdom that is itself a major global investor
we have long since dealt with the khashoggi case we have agreed to continue the financial dialogue and normalize relations again maurer told swiss news agency sda
western allies including some politicians have called on riyadh to hold those responsible for the khashoggi murder accountable
the saudi public prosecutor is seeking the death penalty for five suspects as the kingdom tries to contain its biggest political crisis for a generation
so there had been doubts about saudi arabia s status at davos
after all a number of global investors stayed away from the crown prince s annual future investment initiative conference in october overshadowed by the saudi journalist s death
then at a summit of the big economies in buenos aires leaders appeared to ignore prince mohammed on stage during the family photo even if many went on to have bilateral meetings with him afterwards
but at davos the saudi delegation had dozens of meetings and no western investor pulled out saudi economy minister mohammad al tuwaijri told reuters on wednesday
on a basis in saudi arabia it is business as usual
our job as government is to make sure infrastructure legal in particular is stable
this transformation journey hopefully will attract investors tuwaijri said
he said the probe into the killing needed time
the message he would take back to the crown prince was to listen to the investors feedback
finance minister mohammed said it was absolutely sad what happened to jamal khashoggi but also suggested to wait for the probe s results and the trial
he also said the fact that a billion saudi bond was heavily oversubscribed earlier this month showed investors were regaining confidence
mohammed el kuwaiz chairman of the saudi capital market authority said the murder of khashoggi caused investors to pull back but only temporarily
speaking not just as a government employee but as a saudi citizen everyone in saudi has been absolutely horrified by what happened
but a country of million people should not be held hostage by an event no matter how heinous particularly at this point in time when we have been working very hard to set a new course for the country kuwaiz told reuters
latest saudi data will show new foreign direct investment licenses doubled last year from in a saudi government source said
the world economic forum has chosen two state saudi companies aramco and sabic to be among its strategic partners in
oil giant aramco also plans to issue a mega bond this year and is looking to acquire gas assets in the united states its chief executive told reuters
in the future aramco still plans to list its stock sometime in in what could become the world s largest initial public offering
pouyanne said he was carrying on with a billion refining and petrochemical investment in saudi arabia and would also soon announce a new venture for petrol stations
what is the alternative for a company like total
to boycott saudi arabia
we are always against sanctions and boycotts
who suffer from boycott and sanctions
it s the normal people the people on the street pouyanne told the panel
morgan s gorman also said investors wanted clear light and transparency about the murder which was utterly unacceptable
you have to decide what process you play in a country which has had an incident versus the million people who are going through an extraordinary reform said gorman whose bank has been present in saudi arabia for more over years
bill browder a critic of vladimir putin who successfully pushed through some of the harshest sanctions against russia for the killing of his lawyer known as the magnitsky act said the same sanctions should be applied to saudi arabia
until mohammed bin salman bears responsibility for this crime there can not be business as usual with saudi arabia browder told reuters
