analysis-with fees and laws, india rushes to save vanishing groundwater
mumbai jan thomson reuters foundation indian authorities are imposing a new fee and stricter laws to rein in groundwater use as the world s biggest extractor struggles to find ways to conserve the fast dwindling resource
the water conservation fee for use for drinking and domestic and commercial purposes is due to take effect from june even as several states tighten laws around extraction
but conservationists and campaigners say these efforts will fail unless the government also separates water rights from land ownership and empowers communities to manage and use groundwater and recharge aquifers
the approach so far has been this is my land so the water below it is mine and i can use as much of it as i want said himanshu kulkarni of the advanced center for water resources development and management an advocacy group
but we need to think of groundwater as a common pool resource and look at it from a rights perspective he said
india is the world s largest user of groundwater drawing about cubic kilometres per year or more than a fourth of the global total according to the world bank
more than percent of the country s irrigated agriculture and percent of drinking water supplies are dependent on groundwater the world bank estimates
with a growing population rising demand from agriculture and industry and increasingly erratic monsoon rains india is suffering the worst water crisis in its history according to government niti aayog
about million people nearly half india s population face acute water shortage with close to dying each year from polluted water niti aayog said in a report last year
a draft groundwater bill proposed a new regulatory framework that recognised the fundamental right to water the need for decentralised control and protection of aquifers and sought to give control to local users
but the legislation was not passed by prime minister narendra modi s government and with national elections due by may it has been relegated to the backburner
availability of water is an issue everywhere
but water management which should be a raging election issue is not because we don t pay a meaningful price for it said mridula ramesh founder of the sundaram climate institute in madurai
the water conservation fee is a necessary first step she told the thomson reuters foundation
with its dependence on seasonal rainfall india has long managed water with an elaborate network of canals tanks and wells
water was regarded as a communal resource that was managed by the community
this approach changed with the british who imposed a centralised system and the common law principle in the late emphasising the rights of landowners to access water according to kulkarni
the conflation of the right to water with property ownership led to landowners treating groundwater as a private resource with no thought of its conservation said kulkarni who helped draft the bill
the green revolution launched by the government in the to increase food production led to the widespread use of tubewells which were heavily subsidised resulting in faster depletion of groundwater for irrigation
india has built dams and plans to link rivers to ease availability measures that are opposed by conservationists
the country is also entangled in disputes across the border with its eastern and western neighbours bangladesh and pakistan accusing it of monopolising water flows
to the north and northeast india fears a loss of water to upstream china which plans a series of dams over the tsangpo river called the brahmaputra as it flows into eastern india
a groundwater law was first introduced in india in the and about a dozen states began introducing measures to control use from the
but the legislation has failed to tackle falling water tables and lacks provisions to protect and conserve groundwater at the aquifer level said philippe cullet a professor of environmental law at the university of london s soas
access to a source of groundwater has progressively become a source of power and economic gain said cullet who also helped draft the bill
groundwater is essentially a local resource yet the present framework remains mostly and is incapable of addressing local situations adequately he said
groundwater reserves are under pressure worldwide with warmer temperatures affecting how quickly they replenish resulting in an environmental time bomb for future generations according to a study published this week
in india the world s populous country the crisis has serious implications for food security
nearly million people are at high risk of being unable to rely on surface water including in the northwest and south where much of india s staple wheat and rice are grown according to washington world resources institute
some states including maharashtra are enacting tougher laws to regulate tubewells prevent pollution and limit the type of crops that can be grown in areas
the conservation fee will charge users based on the amount of water extracted in areas
but the fee exempts agricultural users the largest consumers of groundwater and a key voter base
helping farmers manage water can help limit crop failures from failed monsoons said kulkarni whose organisation helped establish pani panchayat or water village councils that were popular in the
in these projects farmers delinked land and water rights and collectively managed harvesting and distributing surface water and groundwater
individual wells were banned as were crops such as sugarcane and bananas
a similar project in seven districts of nearly one million people in andhra pradesh state was described by the world bank as the first global example of success in of groundwater ensuring the rights of the landless community participation equitable distribution and sustainability of the resource is key said kulkarni
it is a fairer more democratic way to manage water and prevents the kind of conflicts we now see over surface water
