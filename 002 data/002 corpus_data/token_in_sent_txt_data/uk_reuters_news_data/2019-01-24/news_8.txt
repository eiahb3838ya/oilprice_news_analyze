update 1-french lng imports soar as australia and united states boost capacity
paris reuters french liquefied natural gas lng imports soared last year as australia the and russia brought more lng to world markets french gas network operator grtgaz said on thursday
in france imported terawatt hours twh of lng the highest level in seven years as shipments rose twh or percent at the montoir lng terminal in brittany and twh or percent at the dunkirk terminal in northern france
imports at the fos terminal on the mediterranean coast were unchanged
lng has come back said grtgaz director thierry trouve told reporters
trouve said that new lng gasification plants in australia and the as well as shipments from russia s yamal plant had reduced the price difference between lng in europe and asia as well as between lng and pipeline gas
while all this new lng may not necessarily come to france we saw no shipments from australia for instance it means that more lng from the middle east comes to europe he said
french gas imports through pipelines mainly from norway the netherlands and russia in fell slightly by twh to twh he said
gas transit shipments to switzerland and italy at twh were the highest in six years as problems with a german pipeline meant that more gas went via french pipes but shipments to spain were down twh or percent
trouve said this illustrated why french and spanish energy regulators earlier this week rejected the step project to boost gas interconnection capacity
for years the spanish argued this project would save france and europe from a ukraine crisis as gas from spain would provide security of supply for the rest of europe trouve said
he said the flow of gas was mostly from north to south and that in the direction the pipelines were not saturated
we don t see the need for this project he added
french gas consumption fell five percent to terawatt hour twh in compared with the previous year due to high temperatures and less use of power generators
industrial gas demand rose for the fifth year in a row as more industries switched from oil and coal power generation to gas grtgaz said adding that conversion to gas power generation represented twh of consumption
