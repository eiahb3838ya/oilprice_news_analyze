south africa's eskom should be split, experts to tell president - sources
eskom struggling to recover from financial crisis ramaphosa has asked experts to come up with plan breaking up eskom should encourage efficiencies by alexander winning johannesburg jan reuters south africa s eskom could be split into three separate firms under proposals from experts president cyril ramaphosa has hired to help revive the ailing state power company two sources familiar with the matter told reuters
reforming eskom is vital to get africa s most industrialised economy firing on all cylinders
it supplies more than percent of the nation s power but is drowning in debt
a sustainability task team picked by ramaphosa is due to report to the president next week but shared its preliminary thoughts about eskom with senior members of the ruling african national congress anc at a meeting that ended on monday
one senior anc source briefed by the task team said it proposed a functional unbundling of eskom which would involve separating it into three entities responsible for power generation distribution and transmission
a second source who met the task team recently confirmed it favoured splitting up eskom a strategy which analysts say should encourage greater efficiency and transparency
ramaphosa s task team also told senior anc members that eskom which has around billion rand billion of debt and is regularly cited as the biggest threat to the country s public finances needed another government bailout to survive said the senior source who asked not to be named
the anc recognises that there is a need for a serious turnaround strategy for eskom
but it feels very strongly that it should not lead to privatisation or massive job losses the senior source said
eskom s debt pile was built up due to heavy staffing stagnating power sales and rising coal costs that it has not been able to pass on to customers analysts say
cost overruns on building two major power plants have also hit its finances
traders said leaks about the task team s proposals which were also reported in south africa s business day newspaper pushed eskom bonds higher on thursday with the and bonds hovering near highs
ramaphosa has made shoring up ailing state firms like eskom a priority since replacing jacob zuma as president in february but progress has been slow because of severe fiscal constraints
he also has to deal with divisions in the anc over how to manage the economy and trade unions which want to avoid layoffs
ramaphosa rejected a proposal by eskom s board of directors last year for the government to take billion rand of the utility s debt saying other options needed to be looked at
he told the world economic forum in davos this week that his government would release eskom s turnaround plan in the next few weeks
the task team s members have agreed not to disclose their recommendations publicly and ramaphosa could choose to ignore their ideas
but analysts say action is needed as creditors are reluctant to lend more to eskom without a credible rescue plan
eskom spokesman khulu phasiwe said he could not comment on the task team s proposals
the presidency will make formal pronouncements on this matter he told reuters
