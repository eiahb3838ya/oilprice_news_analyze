u.s. epa fines for polluters at lowest level in two decades, data shows
washington reuters the environmental protection agency issued million in civil penalties to polluters last year the lowest level in at least two decades when adjusted for inflation according to an analysis of agency data
environmental advocates called the level of fines a symptom of the trump administration s agenda
the epa rejected that assertion and said it was using all the tools at its disposal to deter pollution
the analysis conducted by president barack obama s former epa assistant administrator cynthia giles and first reported by the washington post showed civil fines for polluters during at million the lowest level since at least
over the previous years epa had issued a wide range of fine totals ranging from a low of million in to over billion during obama s final year in office a massive outlier because of a settlement the epa finalized with bp over its oil spill in the gulf of mexico
the median level of the epa s annual fines during that period was about million according to the data which giles shared with reuters on thursday
the environmental integrity project an advocacy group blasted the epa s performance on enforcement under republican president donald trump saying it reflected the administration s and agenda
trump was elected partly on a promise to revive the coal industry and boost oil and gas drilling and he has been working to undo environmental protections
president trump promised to reduce epa to little tidbits during his campaign so it should be no surprise to see enforcement of environmental laws he s never liked decline on his watch eric schaeffer executive director of the environmental integrity project and a former director of civil enforcement at the epa
the epa said it was not giving polluters any breaks and cited a recent million settlement with fiat chrysler over emissions violations
let there be no mistake epa enforcement will continue to correct using all the tools at its disposal including imposing civil penalties to maintain a level playing field and deter future misconduct said susan bodine assistant administrator for epa s office of enforcement and compliance assurance
