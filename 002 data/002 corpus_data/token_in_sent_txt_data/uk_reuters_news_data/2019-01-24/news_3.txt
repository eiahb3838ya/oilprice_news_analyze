column-oil prices in 2019? it's all about the economy: kemp
london reuters oil prices this year will be influenced primarily by the health of the global economy which is why prices have closely tracked equity and bond markets in recent months
shale production growth the policy of opec and its allies sanctions on iran and the threat of sanctions on venezuela may all have an impact on the price of a barrel
but that impact will be secondary and it is more likely to be crude prices that determine what happens with shale policy and sanctions
chartbook predict what will happen to the global economy and the movement of oil prices in should become clear weakening global expansion amid growing risks international monetary fund
business sentiment is buckling under pressure from the deteriorating relationship between the united states and china as well as tightening financial conditions in the form of higher borrowing costs and falling equity prices
the global economic expansion has been losing momentum since the middle of last year and there are signs the slowdown has worsened in recent months with risks skewed to the downside
so oil consumption especially middle distillates such as diesel which are closely linked to freight transportation and industrial activity is likely to grow more slowly in
lower crude prices and the introduction of new pollution regulations on shipping fuels will offset some of the implied slowdown but consumption growth is still set to slacken
the extent of the slowdown depends on whether global growth starts to accelerate again settles into an extended soft patch or falls into an outright recession
the difference between each of these three scenarios amounts to several hundred thousand barrels per day bpd of consumption growth dwarfing all other influences on oil prices in
much will depend on whether the united states and china can successfully their economic conflict and whether financial conditions including equity prices yield curves and credit availability ease
production of crude lease condensates and gas liquids surged by more than million bpd in the largest increase reported in any single country in the history of the oil industry
the frenzied shale boom coupled with signs of slowing consumption growth and unexpectedly generous sanctions waivers on iran s oil exports to push the market towards a large surplus in the fourth quarter
the result has been a sharp drop in prices which has already prompted opec and especially its principal member saudi arabia to cut production sharply
lower prices are also expected to moderate the growth in shale production this year and next albeit after a delay as the industry completes the large number of new wells started during the boom
the energy information administration forecasts growth in petroleum liquids supply will slow from million bpd in to million bpd in and million bpd in
but the speed and depth of any slowdown in shale production is uncertain and likely to depend critically on what happens to prices and thus the economy
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies have announced plans to cut their combined production by million bpd to prevent the oil market from becoming oversupplied
the group s early and aggressive production cuts appear to have removed much of the surplus in the oil market and boosted sentiment
hedge funds and other money managers have stopped selling futures and options linked to brent crude and european gasoil and become small buyers of both since the start of the year
spot brent prices have found a floor above per barrel up from in late december and the structure of futures prices has swung from contango to level and even a small backwardation in the
higher spot prices and firmer calendar spreads have caused some opec policymakers to conclude the market rebalancing process is over
but if the global economy falls into an extended soft patch or even a recession opec and its allies will probably have to make further cuts to prevent a surplus
likewise if shale production does not slow as quickly as anticipated will come under pressure to cut output further
on the other hand if the economy grows strongly shale production slows sharply the resulting market tightening will encourage to unwind some of its output restraints
like the shale producers opec s production policy will ultimately be contingent on the health of the global economy and the rate of oil consumption growth in
the united states has pledged progressively to tighten sanctions on iran s oil exports after the white house decided to pull out of the nuclear agreement reached in
the first phase of sanctions has proved less aggressive than expected after the united states granted generous waivers to some of iran s largest customers in asia
the white house seems to have responded to concerns about the lack of spare capacity in the oil market to replace exports lost from iran and the resulting upward pressure on oil prices
policymakers have proved sensitive to the impact of higher oil prices on fuel costs for motorists and the state of the economy
but the initial waivers were granted for only six months so they will have to be extended narrowed or terminated by may
oil market analysts have speculated about whether the next round of waivers will be tougher or if they will be terminated completely
in practice the last round provides a for
white house decisions will be conditional on the availability of spare capacity and prices which in turn makes them dependent on the state of the oil market and the economy
if the global economy remains sluggish opec is still restricting output and oil prices remain relatively low the white house may take the opportunity to narrow the waivers or remove them altogether
if the global economy is accelerating opec is unwinding its production cuts and oil prices are rising again the white house is likely to be less aggressive
the same considerations apply to possible sanctions on venezuela s oil exports which are likely to be contingent on the anticipated impact on prices and the availability of replacement capacity
in venezuela s case there is an additional complication because there are few alternatives to the country s heavy and crudes
venezuela s heavy crude can not be replaced by light shale production
if the united states decides to impose primary secondary sanctions on venezuela s exports alternative supplies will have to come from saudi arabia the united arab emirates kuwait and iraq
spare capacity in these countries may not be enough to cover for tough sanctions on both iran and venezuela at the same time while leaving enough to absorb further shocks
like everything else the severity of sanctions on iran and venezuela depends on the state of the oil market and the economic outlook
