u.s. govt shutdown threatens rollout of new car models - automakers
washington reuters the partial government shutdown is threatening to delay the of new vehicle models in the united states by stalling required certifications from the environmental protection agency automakers said
the shutdown at days the longest in history has left over federal agency workers without pay and had an impact on everything from access to national parks to airline security screening to the release of economic data
some percent of epa staff has been furloughed including those at the lab in ann arbor michigan responsible for verifying emissions data for new automotive models to ensure they comply with clean air laws
gm has not yet had any vehicle launch delays but like other automakers we are currently awaiting decisions in the certification process for a few model year and vehicles spokeswoman jeannine ginivan said
fiat chrysler chief executive officer mike manley said at the detroit auto show last week that the shutdown had delayed final certification of fca s new ram pickup truck one of its most profitable segments
ford motor co officials said some vehicles could be delayed if the government shutdown goes another days
as the shutdown continues these certification delays will affect vehicle production
consumers will also not have access to the latest technologies and sales could decline as a result industry trade group global automakers told reuters
the epa declined to comment
former acting administrator of the epa stanley meiburg noted the agency s certification process was central to discovering volkswagen s past efforts to cheat on emissions
automakers tend to seek certifications well in advance of releasing them to the market meaning a delayed certification does not always impact the schedule
but the issue could become more serious if the shutdown lingers for much longer meiburg said
any disruptions to this part of the process will disrupt the entire supply chain he said
republican president donald trump has refused to sign any legislation to fund an array of government agencies unless it includes billion billion for his proposed wall on the border with mexico
democrats argue that a wall is costly and there are better ways to shore up national security and curb illegal immigration
