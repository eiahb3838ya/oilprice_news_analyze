libya examines total-marathon purchase, casting doubt on deal - sources
reuters libya is considering whether to intervene in a million deal that french major total announced last month to buy marathon oil s stake in the country s waha concessions several sources familiar with the matter told reuters
officials were considering a range of options ranging from pushing for better terms after some in the oil industry and the media said the price was too low to a from the state national oil corporation noc the sources said
the noc wants to buy the total part one source from the leadership of libya s internationally recognised government the presidency council said
he added that officials were examining the value of the percent waha share with a view to possibly raising funds for a counter offer with money from libya s billion sovereign wealth fund the libyan investment authority lia
they think of the lia as a potential financier lia is exploring it the process is just starting the source said libya had not given the required formal approval to the deal meaning it could be blocked the source added
noc declined to comment
the libyan investment authority did not immediately provide a response
total ceo patrick pouyanne told reporters at an industry event in paris on thursday that the deal was all but settled
the transaction is closed pouyanne said
there are some discussions on some fiscal issues with the government but it will be a spokeswoman for marathon oil said the company had already received payment for the sale of its share
a libyan oil source speaking on condition of anonymity said that at least some within the noc found the price total was paying too low
the deal was still under consideration and negotiations between many parties here in tripoli a second oil libyan oil source said
noc holds a percent stake in waha oil other stakeholders are conocophillips with percent and hess with percent
waha s output of is expected to rise to by the end of the decade according to production figures given by total when it announced the deal in early march
total said the deal would give it access to reserves and resources in excess of million barrels of oil equivalent boe with immediate production of around per day and significant exploration potential in concessions in the sirte basin
the stake carries production risks a waha pipeline has been hit twice in the past four months by suspected attacks most recently on saturday
but it also gives total a presence at fields in eastern libya where most of the country s oil resources lie
total already had stakes in the giant southwestern sharara field and the offshore al jurf field along the tunisian border
libya has been split between rival military factions and governments based in the west and east of the country since
the libyan national army lna has allowed the noc in tripoli to operate facilities on lna territory while opposing the internationally recognised government in the capital
the waha concessions granted decades ago are governed by a law that stipulates that libya s oil ministry must approve the deal the presidency council source said
since the oil ministry is not currently operational that power falls to the presidency council he said though the noc has previously disputed the council s attempts to take over oil ministry powers
