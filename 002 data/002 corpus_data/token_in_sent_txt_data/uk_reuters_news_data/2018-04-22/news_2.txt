the protests though peaceful so far threaten to destabilise a key russian ally in a volatile region riven by a long low level conflict between armenia and azerbaijan and would if successful be a rare example of people power delivering reform in the former soviet union

the situation in armenia has changed you don t have the power of which you are told
