update 3-india says too early to predict sanctions impact on iran imports
abu dhabi reuters india s oil minister on saturday expressed concern about the rise oil prices but said it was too early to predict the impact of sanctions on his country s imports of iranian oil after washington withdrew from the iran nuclear deal
this kind of geopolitical tension affects both consuming and producing countries
we have to live with the reality of the present geopolitics minister dharmendra pradhan told reuters during a visit to the united arab emirates
president donald trump on tuesday reneged on an international nuclear accord with iran and announced renewed sanctions against the opec member
the original agreement had lifted sanctions for tehran limiting its nuclear programme
crude prices remained just below highs with brent on track for a weekly percent gain and crude a percent weekly rise
brent crude settled down cents at a barrel on friday
pradhan said he was a little bit concerned about the impact of the current rise in oil prices on consuming countries but that he did not think oil supply would be an issue
let s see how things are moving
it s too early to predict in one way
we are watching very carefully he said
iran is the oil producer in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
iran ramped up supplies after lifting the sanctions in producing million bpd in march
analysts now expect iran s supplies to fall by between bpd and million bpd depending on how many other countries fall in line with washington
during the last round of sanctions india enjoyed waivers allowing limited iranian oil imports paid for in rupees instead of dollars
when sanctions were loosened against tehran india increased imports from iran to almost bpd in late but intake has fallen back to around bpd this year
pradhan also said that there was a consensus between saudi arabia s state oil giant saudi aramco abu dhabi national oil company adnoc and indian companies to firm a joint venture for india s ratnagiri oil refinery
the planned billion facility in western india will be one of the largest refining and petrochemical complexes in the world at million barrels per day
aramco in april signed a deal with india for a percent stake in the project saying it may introduce at a later stage a strategic partner to share its percent stake
adnoc wants to expand its downstream portfolio in markets where demand for oil is still growing such as china and india securing a new outlet for its crude
pradhan was speaking at adnoc s headquarters on the sidelines of an event marking the first cargo of crude oil from adnoc to the indian strategic petroleum reserves ltd isprl after it has been loaded and was to india
the cargo is the first under an agreement between adnoc and india s company isprl to locate million barrels of adnoc crude oil at the karnataka facility in the indian city of mangalore adnoc said in a statement
the loading ceremony of approximately million barrels of adnoc crude oil was witnessed by pradhan and uae minister of state and adnoc s ceo sultan in abu dhabi
the strategic reserve will provide a boost to india s energy security and help us deal with supply side disruptions
while part of the stored oil will be used for commercial purposes by adnoc the major part will be purely for strategic purposes pardhan said in a statement after the ceremony
