bulgarian govt to seek mandate for talks with investors over nuclear plant
sofia may reuters bulgaria s government will ask parliament to give it the authority to negotiate with investors to build the belene nuclear power project on the danube river the prime minister said on saturday
the black sea state initially cancelled the project estimated to cost about billion euros in after failing to find foreign investors and bowing to and european union pressure to limit the country s energy dependence on russia which would have supplied some equipment
the current government of prime minister boyko borissov however is renewing the search for private investors to build the plant after an arbitration court ruled in that bulgaria must pay more than million euros million in compensation to russian state nuclear company rosatom due to the cancellation
it will be the country s second nuclear power station after the kozloduy plant which is also on the danube
in july bulgaria will host an annual summit of leaders from central and eastern european countries and china a group dubbed by beijing
china national nuclear corp cnnc has already expressed an interest in investing in the megawatt nuclear power project
the moratorium should end to allow parliament to give me a mandate to talk to investors before the meeting in july borissov said adding bulgaria had already spent billion levs billion on the project
parliament said in march that the energy ministry should draw up proposals by the end of june on whether to proceed with or scrap plans for the belene project
a month earlier borissov suggested belene be built as a project to boost energy security and connectivity and urged its neighbours in the region to consider the option
critics of the project first launched in argue that the investment does not justify the benefits and that the project has been a source of corrupt practices for decades
