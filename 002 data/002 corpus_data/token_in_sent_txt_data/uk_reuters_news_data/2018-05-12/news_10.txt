update 4-hawaii braces for worse lava flows from erupting volcano
updates with details from the neighborhood in paragraphs by terray sylvester pahoa hawaii may reuters more destructive lava flows could soon hit hawaii s big island as the kilauea volcano erupts posing a greater threat than oozing magma that has so far destroyed dozens of homes and forced thousands to evacuate scientists said
as a lava lake at kilauea s summit drains inside the volcano magma is running underground
it could burst to the surface as large and intensely hot lava flows and produce higher levels of toxic gases hawaiian volcano observatory tina neal said
what will take a turn for the worse in terms of hazard is if hotter fresher magma makes it to the surface and that could be what is coming neal told a conference call on friday
once a new batch of hotter gassier magma makes it to the surface we might see larger higher eruption fifteen large cracks or fissures have opened on the eastern flank of kilauea since the volcano erupted eight days ago
the volcanic vents have oozed relatively cool sluggish magma left over from a similar event in
fresher magma could now emerge behind it
in addition kilauea one of the world s most active volcanoes threatens to begin a series of explosive eruptions within days or weeks that could form huge clouds of volcanic smog or vog and hurl boulders as big as small cars
geologists expect new lava outbreaks in or around the leilani estates area in the southeastern puna district about miles km south of hilo where homes have been destroyed and all residents have been evacuated
local residents got a text message alert at on friday warning them they could have little or no time to evacuate in the event of future eruptions
we are telling people to plan for the worst
they should have a plan a a plan b and a plan c said roann okomura a county official who is helping run one of the shelters set up for evacuees
ron peters knew it was time to leave his home in the opihikao community miles from leilani estates when fruit trees and other vegetation began to die in the clouds of gas
when you start seeing ferns go brown overnight it s like wow i got ta get out of here said peters sitting at a red cross evacuation center at a sports center in nearby pahoa
his wife refused to leave and stayed to care for their dogs and chickens
he went back for her on thursday fearing she and the animals would be dead
one of the dogs was having trouble moving but his wife was still alive
he set his chickens free
the gas fumes were just too much he said sitting at a baseball diamond with his dogs tied beside him
while locals contend with lava and gas on the ground explosions at kilauea s summit some miles km to the west were dusting communities with ash that irritated eyes and breathing
south of leilani estates in the neighborhood residents are on high alert as the air quality is low and there are very few ways out of the area if an evacuation is ordered
there are some pretty balanced people here who are trying to lead normal lives
but we also don t want to be stupid said cindy hartman who lives in the neighborhood
volcanic smog may be blowing hundreds of miles from kilauea with people on the streets of state capital honolulu around miles km northwest on the island of oahu complaining it was very voggy on friday
