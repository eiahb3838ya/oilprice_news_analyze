china's lng imports reach another record amid high stocks
imports do not reflect growth in domestic demand cnooc resold at least one lng cargo in january gas demand growth to decelerate by jessica jaganathan and chen aizhu singapore feb reuters china s imports of liquefied natural gas lng rose to another monthly record in january even as the country grapples with high gas inventories amid a winter according to shipping data and industry sources
the world s lng importer took million tonnes of lng in january beating the previous record hit in december by nearly percent according to refinitiv eikon shipping data
china s imports last year surged percent from after gas shortages the previous winter prompted chinese companies to stock up on supplies and cargoes with beijing continuing to push millions of households to switch to gas from coal for heating
but the import growth is not wholly due to a rise in demand said an industry source familiar with the chinese market
when people see these numbers they think chinese demand is up but actually it is causing a headache for importers as they have overbought and can t find demand to absorb the cargoes the source said declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media
china national offshore oil corp cnooc resold at least one lng cargo in january and possibly another an unusual move during what is typically a peak demand period and highlighting this year s warmer weather industry sources said
chinese traders are offering lng cargoes to international buyers or selling into their domestic market at prices the first source said
the lunar new year holiday has also made the situation worse because factories are shutdown for a least a week he said
wholesale lng from small liquefaction plants fell to yuan a tonne on less than half levels of last year according to chinese monitoring agency
quotes at receiving terminals in east china s shandong and north china s tianjin last stood at yuan a tonne down percent and percent respectively from late november shortly after heating season started
china s gas demand growth should decelerate from the past two years said james taverner of energy consultancy ihs markit
switching mandates are moderating due to security of supply concerns and weakening economic growth taverner said
there is also limited capacity in north china for further lng after big increases the past two years he said
trade tensions between the united states and china have also tightened financial conditions dragging china s growth last year to its weakest in years
