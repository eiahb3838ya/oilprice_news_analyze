the is a major power but do not pursue your own policy priorities we live iraq is in a difficult position as tensions between its two biggest allies the united states and iran increase
it is of fundamental interest for iraq to have good relations with iran and other neighbouring countries salih said
trump announced in december that the troops in syria would be withdrawn on the grounds that islamic state militants no longer pose a threat
during a recent visit to iraq trump said he had no plans to withdraw troops from iraq
in a report released on monday the pentagon inspector general said islamic state remained an active insurgent group and was regenerating functions and capabilities more quickly in iraq than syria

the report citing information from central command said islamic state would portray the withdrawal as a victory and conduct attacks on personnel during it
