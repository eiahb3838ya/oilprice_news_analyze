interview-unpalatable numbers: statistician who rocked indian govt had to take a stand
new delhi reuters
mohanan grew up in a village without electricity studied statistics at a public university and then spent more than three decades crunching numbers for the indian government
but in the past week the official has been caught up in a political storm that has threatened to undermine prime minister narendra modi s government months before a general election
on mohanan resigned as acting chairman of the national statistical commission nsc a advisory body that checks the quality of india s official data in protest at a delay in releasing a new set of jobs statistics
another member of the nsc meenakshi quit with him
three days later some of those jobs numbers were leaked to the business standard newspaper which reported that india s unemployment rate in the year ending june rose to percent its highest level in at least years
the figures are potentially crucial before the election due to be held by may as modi s bharatiya janata party bjp struggles to win over voters concerned about depressed farm incomes and a lack of job creation
india needs to create more than a million jobs each month just to find employment for young people entering the workforce
officials from niti aayog a government think tank formed by modi in that is not normally involved in official releases of economic data have rejected the job numbers reported by the business standard
they said the report was still in draft form and argued that more quarterly data was required to publish a comparable jobs report
finance minister arun jaitley also told reuters news partner ani the report was a draft which has not been but in an interview with reuters this weekend mohanan says he has no regrets about walking out in protest at the delay
he said the nsc which was supposed to be the final authority on statistics before they were published had been repeatedly sidelined by the government in recent months and the delay in the jobs figures was the final straw
data should be released as per the calendar whether it is to your liking or not liking he said
otherwise where is credibility in the system it is unclear where the business standard got the figures
mohanan stresses it wasn t from him and declined to discuss the specifics of the jobs report with reuters
mohanan who says he is not active politically said the nsc approved the report on and expected it to be released soon after
when it didn t happen he reached out to top officials including the chief statistician pravin srivastava even flying to new delhi from mohanan s home in southern india for a meeting with him in late january
he says he didn t get a satisfactory explanation for the delay in any of those discussions
with the report still unreleased mohanan and meenakshi quit a few days later
mohanan said he felt it was important that he stood up for the integrity of the organisation the nsso where he built his career
he had joined the nsc as a member in two years after retiring from india s statistics service which includes the nsso
when he became the acting head in november he found the nsc s role had diminished under the modi government
it was starved of resources and it wasn t engaged in major statistical initiatives as they should be under ministry guidelines
there was also a controversy over the release in november of historical gdp data with a new base year which was used by the government to attack the opposition congress party
the data showed growth was lower than previously thought during the previous government
he said his concern was the way niti aayog was involved in releasing the numbers
the government think tank said they had been brought in to assess the numbers before that announcement according to local media
as to niti aayog s arguments against publishing the jobs data both mohanan and a senior former nsso official said they are bogus
there is no relation between this report and the quarterly data the former nsso official said requesting anonymity
radha binod barman who chaired the nsc between and said the national statistical commission should have been the final authority on whether to release the jobs report
niti aayog and india s statistics ministry did not respond to emails seeking comment
for mohanan it has been a stressful past week
he realizes this might be the end of his government life but is ready to settle into retirement in the village he grew up in the state of kerala
having made his point mohanan s one big hope is that the nsc and the indian statistics team will now be shown more respect
