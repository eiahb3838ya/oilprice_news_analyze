german grid firms see extra costs to meet renewable power target
essen germany reuters boosting renewables to percent of germany s power mix by could cost billion euros more than previously planned which will mean higher consumer energy bills the four main grid operators said on monday
last year germany raised its target for the contribution of renewables to percent by from percent in a bid to reduce emissions by percent over levels
it is set to miss a target aimed at cutting emissions by percent
about two fifths of power needs in europe s largest economy are now met by renewables but this needs to rise as it seeks to close nuclear plants by and coal power stations by
as a result power grids need to be extended to reach renewable energy sites
this will include new transmission lines to connect the industrial south with northern wind power farms
the grid companies known as transmission system operators tsos have presented plans for a consultation outlining spending on onshore lines of billion euros billion compared to the billion euros previously envisaged
the four main tsos enbw s transnetbw tennet and amprion said in a statement that an additional billion to billion euros would be needed to link up offshore wind farms
total spending of billion to billion euros over years would be shouldered by consumers via higher grid fees which account for about a quarter of their electricity bills
however the energy regulator bundesnetzagentur said between a quarter and a third of costs estimated by tsos in the past were not approved
the tsos said some of extra costs arose from digitalising transmission systems and running more lines underground
the tsos demands include adding two more lines on top of three underground ones already planned for
between a quarter and half of power demand in southern germany will have to be met by renewable generation in the north where plants now generate double the north s needs
the additional lines to be built would run from to baden wuerttemberg via westphalia with capacity for gigawatts gw over a distance of kms miles the tsos said
we will study the draft plan very carefully to decide whether all transport capacities are being exploited peter franke vice president of bundesnetzagentur told a panel discussion at an industry event in essen
the regulator said in january it would seek to rein in costs especially as germany s plan to quit coal generation would demand new spending
