extreme u.s. natural gas volatility to ease after winter -analysts
feb reuters the most extreme period of volatility in natural gas futures in nearly years is set to a close as the winter weather turns warmer but not before the wild price swings caused one trading firm to collapse

for an interactive graphic on extreme volatility in natural gas futures see the combination of colder forecasts concerns about low levels of gas in storage and the falloff of hedge fund bets on gas kicked off the longest streak of extreme volatility since

in addition hedge funds in general were forced to shift positions as many were caught betting on a sleepy lackluster pricing environment
investors are once again betting on low volatility but with winter more than half over that bet is a safer one as demand for heating will decline
i think volatility will decline in coming weeks as the weather gets warmer said steve crossin chief executive of long crossin investments llc a private investment firm in denver noting the sharp increase in volatility since november was caused by the market s assessment of winter weather and its effect on heating over the past four trading sessions gas prices slipped to their lowest level in nine months even as demand for the fuel spiked to a record high during a polar vortex that froze the midwest and northeast and caused several utilities to call on customers to use less fuel
traders said prices declined because the market has moved past the brief brutal freeze as it focused on warmer weather expected to last through late february
over the past four sessions including monday the spread averaged just percent
volatility is going to be substantially reduced as we exit the winter but i don t think we will see the incredibly depressed volatility we saw for much of said kyle cooper consultant at ion energy in houston
