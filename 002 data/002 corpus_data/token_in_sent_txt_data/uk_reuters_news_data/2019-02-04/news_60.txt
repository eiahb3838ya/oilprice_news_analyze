column-south africa will struggle to boost coal exports, even if it wants to: russell
cape town reuters there may be some irony in climate change being blamed for an increase in weather delays that resulted in south africa s coal exports dropping percent last year but in reality the rough seas at the country s richards bay terminal are the least of the industry s worries
shipments from richards bay declined to million tonnes in from million the prior year well below the million tonnes capacity of the terminal which is the in the world behind newcastle port in australia
the terminal lost days of loading last year because of rough weather down slightly from days in with both these years being considerably higher than in preceding years
but even if the terminal was fully available all days of the year it s still unlikely that much more coal would have been shipped
the blame for south africa s lower exports was placed on market conditions by the head of richards bay coal terminal rbct alan waller with high prices crimping demand in the main export destination of india
however rbct chair nosipho said the weather disruptions are also likely a challenge for future years and terminals around the world were going to have to deal with the new norm of what was previously abnormal weather patterns
while high prices were undoubtedly a contributing factor to the lower exports it s also likely that infrastructure constraints and an inability of many of south africa s coal miners to boost production were perhaps of greater importance
the rail network has a theoretical capacity of delivering million tonnes a year from south africa s inland mines to rbct meaning that even if it was working at full steam there still wouldn t be enough coal to use up rbct s export capacity
mandisa mondi the general manager of coal freight at rail operator transnet told the ihs markit southern african coal conference in cape town last week that plans were in place to boost the rail capacity to match that of rbct
these include initial steps to improve technology and operational efficiencies to reduce bottlenecks followed by later infrastructure improvements such as a new tunnel through a mountain between the inland coal fields and the coast
transnet said it could eventually boost the rail capacity available for exports by million tonnes above current levels but whether this happens depends on whether miners commit to producing and exporting more
it s here where the situation becomes less clear with companies having been reluctant in recent years to invest in building new mines or even expanding existing operations
part of this was because of a dispute over south africa s mining laws although that appears to have been settled recently
still south africa s coal miners would have to take a positive view of likely demand before committing capital to new projects
the ihs markit conference heard some rosy forecasts of demand for coal mainly on a surge in new power plants being built in india
however these forecasts are likely to prove hopelessly optimistic especially as renewable energies become cheaper and more reliable and as more liquefied natural gas lng becomes available from projects in australia the united states and russia
just under half of south africa s coal went to india in a country with an official policy of reducing coal imports to zero over time
other major buyers include south korea which also plans to lower coal burning and pakistan which has concerns over the foreign exchange cost of importing fuels
while south african coal is viewed as a good quality product and superior to supplies from top thermal coal exporter indonesia there are serious questions as to whether there will be sufficient demand in asia to justify spending the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to boost mine supply and rail capacity
this makes it likely that south africa will continue to be a relatively steady supplier of around million tonnes of coal a year to the seaborne market
this could increase somewhat if transnet can and rbct doesn t lose more days to rough weather
but for now any ambitious plans to boost coal exports are exactly that just plans
