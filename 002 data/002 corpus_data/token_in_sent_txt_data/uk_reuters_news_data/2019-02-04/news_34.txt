update 2-iran's top judge: eu preconditions for non-dollar trade channel "unacceptable"
reuters iran s top judge said on monday that tehran would never accept the humiliating conditions set by the european union for trade intended to evade sanctions the tasnim news agency reported
france germany and britain have opened a new channel for trade with iran to get around the sanctions reimposed on iran after president donald trump s decision in may to exit a nuclear deal between tehran and six major powers
after nine months of procrastination and negotiation europeans have created a mechanism with limited capacity only for food and medicine tasnim quoted sadeq as saying
iran will never accept their strange and humiliating conditions of joining the fatf the financial action task force and negotiations on its missile a french british and german statement on friday made no mention of any preconditions although the european powers must now establish a budget and define its rules before the mechanism can be operational
welcoming their move iranian deputy foreign minister abbas araqchi said on friday tehran would also have to set up a mirror company
the two sides are to hold talks this week on the process
the european statement said they expected iran to swiftly implement all elements of its fatf action plan
fatf is not a precondition it s a strong expectation said a senior european diplomat dismissing any suggestion that ballistic missile talks had anything to do with creating the mechanism
iran has threatened to pull out of the nuclear deal unless the european powers enable it to receive economic benefits
the europeans have promised to help companies do business with iran as long as it abides by the deal
new sanctions have largely succeeded in persuading european companies to abandon business with iran and washington said it did not expect the eu effort known as instex or instrument for supporting trade exchanges to change that
even as european powers have worked to preserve the nuclear deal relations with tehran have been worsening
the eu this month imposed its first sanctions on iran since the nuclear pact in response to assassination plots on european soil
they are also considering whether to push for sanctions on iran s ballistic missile programme if talks between the two sides on the issue do not progress
