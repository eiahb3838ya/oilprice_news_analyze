update 3-trump to nominate ex-energy lobbyist bernhardt to head interior
washington reuters president donald trump said on monday he would nominate david bernhardt a former energy lobbyist to be secretary of the interior the department that oversees public lands
bernhardt currently the acting secretary at the interior department is widely expected to continue pushing the trump administration s plan to boost domestic fossil fuels production by opening more public lands to drilling and mining
david has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed trump said on twitter
bernhardt would replace ryan zinke who was under a cloud of ethics investigations and announced his resignation in december
the interior department which employs more than people and oversees more than percent of the land surface has been central to trump s energy dominance policy of boosting energy production
as zinke s deputy bernhardt has played a role in efforts to open alaska s arctic national wildlife refuge to oil drilling ease protections on a bird called the greater sage grouse to boost drilling and mining across the west and open federal lands to leases for coal mining
ann navaro a former department of interior official who served in the obama and trump administrations and worked closely with bernhardt said he is a rare lawyer s lawyer who prepares thoroughly for meetings often being the only one in a room to have read full environmental assessments of projects and plans
bernhardt who prefers conservative suits to zinke s cowboy hats and boots also worked a series of jobs at the interior department under former president george bush from to early including as the department s solicitor
after working under bush bernhardt became a lawyer and lobbyist at brownstein hyatt farber schreck for water and oil interests
he represented noble energy inc rosemont copper co sempra energy and california s westlands water district among others
bernhardt has long been an advocate of reforming the endangered species act the law that protects plants and animals at risk from resource extraction and development
if he is approved by the senate bernhardt is expected to continue that work
critics say bernhardt s previous work as a lobbyist could risk conflicts of interest unless he recuses himself from certain issues because he worked for companies that could benefit by opening up lands to development
about environmental groups in including the natural resources defense council urged senators to oppose bernhardt in the confirmation vote for his deputy position saying his previous lobbyist work raised questions about his ability to act in the public interest
despite their letter calling him a walking conflict of interest the senate confirmed bernhardt on a mostly vote and with strong support from alaska senator lisa murkowski and other lawmakers who have large areas of lands in their states
if bernhardt ascends to secretary it would mirror the change of guard at the environmental protection agency where last july acting administrator andrew wheeler a former coal lobbyist replaced scott pruitt who stepped down after a series of probes into his conduct
wheeler is a staunch proponent of trump s energy dominance agenda to produce oil gas and coal for both domestic use and export
