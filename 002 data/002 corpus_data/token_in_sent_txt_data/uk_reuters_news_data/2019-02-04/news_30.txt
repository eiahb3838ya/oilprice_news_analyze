germany's rwe could preserve hambach forest, but at a price
essen germany reuters german utility rwe could preserve a forest in the west of the country after a deal to coal mining and generation although the cost of doing so would run into tens of millions of euros its chief executive said on monday
germany s coal commission said on that preserving the hambach forest was desirable in a blow to one of rwe s main sources of lignite where mining operations have been halted since a court order in october
rolf martin schmitz told an industry conference in essen that once it was clear what the roadmap was then rwe would have to draw up a new plan for brown coal lignite and would decide whether it was feasible not to fell trees
while it would be technically possible but would cost tens of millions of euros given the space needed for mining waste said schmitz adding one would have to ask oneself how much is a tree rwe is germany s largest operator of power plants and employs about staff in the rheinische coal mining area which also includes power plants
plans to expand the mine by clearing the forest which has become a symbol of industry protest have been delayed and schmitz has warned that jobs could be lost if it can not continue mining activities in hambach
