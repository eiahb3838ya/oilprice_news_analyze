feature-'people's payout' gathers steam as a fairer way to tax carbon
barcelona feb thomson reuters foundation at the mouth of a picturesque rural valley in southern france near the spanish border odessa roitg has a tough job trying to get people to use private cars less and greener transport more
the area of communes with its base in the arty town of céret approved a new climate change plan in december that aims to improve the public bus service and encourage for people to get to work the young bureaucrat said
the administration itself uses electric bikes and vehicles for some of its operations
but in this part of france with few transport alternatives to driving a car roitg can understand why some people support ongoing protests by the gilets jaunes yellow vests sparked in november by a planned hike in diesel taxes
people get a bit annoyed when the government speaks to them about the environment and sustainable development because it comes with taxes and things costing more when it should cost them less she said
the yellow vest protests caused concern among officials gathered at the annual climate talks in poland in december many of them looking for ways to curb emissions without stoking social discontent
growing pressure to slash emissions to meet global warming limits set in the paris agreement and prevent the worst impacts of climate change means more governments are considering pricing carbon
usually that is done by taxing fossil fuels or by capping industry emissions and setting up a scheme to trade allowances
mathilde bouyé an associate with the climate programme at the world resources institute said france s aborted attempt to hike fuel prices came on top of a tax cut for the wealthy and was the last straw for families
what is behind this is a matter of equity she told the thomson reuters foundation
there is no opposition in principle to carbon but citizens are unwilling to bear the brunt of the costs when they feel the burden should be shared with large corporations she added
she noted that the gilets jaunes have called for higher taxes on shipping and aircraft for example
another problem in france was that the extra income from fuel price hikes had been earmarked for the french state budget rather than to support concrete projects to help people adopt clean energy
in response to social unrest france has now launched a nationwide grand debate on four themes including the ecological transition and taxation to which anyone can contribute online or at municipal meetings
laurence tubiana ceo of the european climate foundation said french voters had little trust in the government on climate change policies but all may not be lost
i think the grand debate will offer the possibility for the government to reshape its policy because it will give the president a new legitimacy to do that she said
george marshall a lead author of a world bank guide issued in december on communicating carbon pricing said consulting the public was crucial though often skipped in designing policies to make people pay more for fossil fuels
including a wide range of views from the outset is key he told a briefing on the guide
we can not sell something that is a poorly constructed policy said marshall founder of climate outreach a organisation that works to improve communication around climate change
addressing people s most immediate concerns which may well not include climate change is crucial too
the top environmental issue for many responding to france s grand debate online survey is air pollution for instance and action on that could also help reduce emissions
marshall said the public often responds badly to a conventional narrative that lays out the threats and costs of climate change then goes on to explain in economic terms why it is cheaper to act now than cough up for the damage later
instead the benefits have to be put first and foremost he explained
how the money raised from a carbon levy will be used is also key to gaining public acceptance he said
in canada s british columbia province revenue from its carbon tax introduced in is given back to individuals via a climate action tax credit
the tax has proved largely successful both in terms of curbing emissions and public
a similar policy is now being rolled out at national level
in the united states meanwhile a bill has been introduced in the house of representatives and the senate calling for a fee on fossil fuels with the money collected paid back in equal shares to americans each month as a carbon dividend an idea that is supported by eminent economists
researchers at georgia state university and the cicero center for international climate research surveyed nearly people in five countries britain the united states australia south africa and india in on how funds from a hypothetical global carbon tax ought to be used
the three methods that garnered more than percent approval in all five countries were lowering income taxes redistributing revenues domestically to each citizen and investing the funds in renewable energy projects in every nation worldwide
reporting their findings in the journal nature last month the researchers wrote that returning revenue in the form of a people s payout is becoming increasingly popular
it appeals to the political right because it does not swell state coffers and the left is happy because the average tax burden is unchanged and households end up better off
stefano carattini assistant economics professor at georgia state university urged countries and jurisdictions with carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes which now cover about a fifth of global emissions to form an international club aimed at harmonising systems and raising the carbon price
such a club could also lobby the world trade organization to reform rules to allow carbon taxes to be levied on imports he said
eventually if enough states came onboard the existing messy system of each nation setting an emissions target in the hope of keeping global warming in check could be jettisoned for a single global carbon price he argued
climate chief patricia espinosa meanwhile called for a more positive narrative on the benefits of a green transformation
yes we are fighting climate change but we are working towards a sustainable resilient world that is good for health for nutrition for the quality of life of people she told the thomson reuters foundation
