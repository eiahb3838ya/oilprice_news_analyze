india's bharat petroleum plans $3 bln petchem plant near mumbai
mumbai march reuters india s bharat petroleum corporation ltd bpcl plans to build a billion petrochemical unit to serve the mumbai region a company official said to profit from the country s expected surge in demand for petrochemicals as its economy expands
bpcl s expansion is part of a national plan to spend billion on petrochemical production in order to meet the expected increase in consumption of the chemicals for products including plastics paints and adhesives
india currently only produces about million tonnes a year of petrochemicals less than the million tonnes of demand expected for the financial year
demand is expected to almost double again within a decade according to a report from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas
bpcl earlier this month bought acres hectares of land from a fertiliser unit of hindustan organic chemicals ltd hindustan organic said in a notice to the bombay stock exchange on march
the land will allow bpcl to build a petrochemical complex that will use feedstocks from its mumbai refinery which processes barrels per day bpd of crude ramachandran head of refineries at bpcl told reuters this week
the site is about km miles from the refinery
this land deal is fundamental to enhancing our petrochemical portfolio said ramachandran
going forward petchem consumption is likely to be higher than the conventional fuels so it is better if we start thinking in that direction to transport feedstock to the new petrochemical complex ramachandran said there was a plan to build a pipeline from the refinery to a nearby port and tankers would then deliver the feedstock to the facility
alternatively he said a direct pipeline between the mumbai refinery and the petrochemical facility could be built
he said the facility would focus on producing propylene but also produce polyethylene at lower quantities
ramachandran told reuters the company had not been able to expand the mumbai refinery for the petrochemical site because of limited land availability in the city
the petrochemical complex will be ready by he said
bpcl plans to pump feedstocks from the mumbai refinery by pipeline to a nearby port to load onto tankers that will then carry it to the petrochemical complex said a source familiar with the matter
bpcl already produces petrochemicals at its bpd kochi refinery in southern india
bpcl is also constructing a billion rupees million project at kochi to produce chemicals like acryl and acrylic acid used in products like paints adhesives or textiles which ramachandran said would be commissioned next year
bpcl also plans to build a petrochemical plant at its bpd bina refinery in central india
we are targeting petrochemical production equivalent to to percent of our crude processing in the long run he said
