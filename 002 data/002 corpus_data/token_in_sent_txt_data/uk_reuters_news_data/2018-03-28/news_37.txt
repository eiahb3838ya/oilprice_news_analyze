explainer-shanghai crude futures complete globalization of oil markets
singapore march reuters china s launch of a crude oil contract this week on the shanghai futures exchange shfe allows investors for the first time to take advantage of differences in dynamics across world oil markets
oil markets have until now been dominated by two financial futures instruments west texas intermediate wti and europe s brent crude
wti is the main benchmark for crude grades and a crucial hedging tool for the oil industry
brent priced off north sea oil is the primary value marker for europe middle east and african crudes
both are used extensively by industry and financial traders
asia so far has lacked a financial instrument despite its position as the world s biggest and oil consumer
previous attempts to establish one have been made in singapore japan and dubai but have not been widely taken up
shanghai crude futures may have done the trick though if traded volumes this week hold beyond initial enthusiasm
success in shanghai would mean the three main global oil markets apac europe middle east and africa emea and the americas amers each have a benchmark reflecting their distinct drivers
china s oil demand makes up more than a quarter of asian consumption and nearly a tenth globally
hopefully it shanghai crude gets a lot of traction and we end up with three established global benchmarks said greg mckenna chief market strategist at futures brokerage axitrader
one of the main attractions of having globally available crude oil futures is for financial traders to take advantage of regional prices without investing in physical oil or operating assets such as tankers oil fields or refineries
investors typically take advantage of differences in prices through arbitrage trading
before this week the primary means of doing this in crude markets was via a financial product based on the price spread
in emea brent futures are heavily influenced by output policy from the middle organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec as well as by russia the world s biggest oil producer
since both opec and russia have been withholding production since to prop up prices the spread currently reflects a premium that brent holds over wti
in the americas meanwhile oil production has jumped by a quarter since to million barrels per day bpd further supporting the gap
now investors can also trade the arbitrages between china and the rest of the world
it would have been profitable this week for example to buy the spread between brent and shanghai by going long in the european contract and shorting asia s as the spread widened from a barrel on monday to on wednesday
that means closing the positions would have gained an investor per barrel
a spread can be sold as well
had a trader gone short shanghai but long wti it would have yielded a gain of a barrel as the gap between the two narrowed from a barrel on monday to just cents on wednesday
buying wti while selling shanghai would effectively replicate in financial markets the surge in actual crude exports to china seen in the last two years
crude futures also offer industry participants like oil producers and petroleum refiners the chance to protect their assets through what is known as hedging
so far this has been done through the and european benchmarks
a chinese refiner importing middle east crudes which are mostly priced off brent and needing to protect itself from a sudden jump in prices for those grades would typically buy brent futures
that way losses from higher raw material costs can be mitigated by gains made in the european crude futures
now the shanghai contract offers risk control strategies better reflecting local demand and supply
should chinese fuel demand fall and dent the refinery s sales that would likely also pull down shanghai crude futures
a short position in shanghai futures would profit from the decline offsetting at least some of the drop in revenue the refiner would see in its petroleum sales
oil producers by contrast need to protect crude output from falling prices
thus a shale producer selling into asia could take a short position in shanghai to offset any drop in income from physical crude sales if demand and prices unexpectedly fall off in asia
