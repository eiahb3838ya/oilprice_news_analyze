reuters hamburg s tax office is examining the german activities of agricultural merchant archer daniels midland over a period in what the company called a routine audit although sources said adm could face unforeseen liabilities
two sources familiar with the matter said the audit had been complicated by the departure of several senior trading officials from adm s german operations in previous years of whom some had been made redundant through restructuring
due to a resulting lack of staff with the experience needed to field the authorities questions adm could have to pay more tax on billions of dollars of turnover they added
this should have been a routine tax enquiry

data for and covered the financial years ending june
the revenue data for to was for the years ending
adm was meant to have paid a standard corporate tax rate of percent in the period but both sources said it had paid low taxes as a result of carrying forward trading losses and writing off other costs against tax
the taxable result could be higher if the hedges made through the futures markets can not be shown to relate to physical trades the source said
if that relationship can not be proven then losses incurred on the futures market may not be both sources said it was unclear at this stage how much additional tax if any adm could face

adm is one of a quartet of merchants alongside bunge cargill and louis dreyfus nicknamed the abcds after their initials that has dominated trade in agricultural goods for decades
adm has been trying to invest in lucrative areas such as natural flavourings and food ingredients to boost earnings in volatile commodity markets and raise margins hit by low prices
