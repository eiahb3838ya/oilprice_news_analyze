california attorney general says ready to defend vehicle efficiency standards
washington march reuters california is prepared to sue the environmental protection agency if it tries to weaken vehicle efficiency standards the state s attorney general said on tuesday setting up another in a series of legal fights between sacramento and the trump administration
the epa is expected to declare by april that current rules aimed at doubling average fuel efficiency to about miles km per gallon by are not appropriate sources told reuters last week
the declaration would enable the epa to take steps to weaken those federal standards which had been implemented by the administration of former president barack obama a democrat with the backing of automakers
we are going to do everything that can been done to defend these standards california attorney general xavier becerra told reuters in an interview
so far when we have been challenged on environmental standards we have had a good record in court
we haven t lost a in california s air emissions regulator and the obama administration reached an agreement with major automakers to nearly double average fleetwide fuel efficiency by but included a midterm review to determine by april whether the final requirements were feasible
but if the administration of republican president donald trump weakens federal auto efficiency standards then california the most populous state and a massive market for automakers could enforce its own stricter rules that nearly a dozen other states including new york would follow
carmakers are worried that such a dispute would lead to a patchwork of different standards across the country
epa administrator scott pruitt told reuters in january that california doesn t have the authority to set the standards for the rest of the country leading some officials in the state to worry the administration could attempt to revoke sacramento s authority to set its own rules
epa spokeswoman liz bowman confirmed its recommendation is under interagency review and will be completed by the april deadline
becerra said he is confident courts would side with california if epa tries to weaken the federal standards or further down the road undercut the state s special authority under the federal clean air act to set its own
we are not yet at round one and we think we have some good knockout punches for the next rounds he said
