investors in vietnam learn to live with anti-corruption crackdown, some embrace it
hanoi reuters a crackdown on corruption in vietnam unnerved some foreign investors when it intensified last year but they are now getting much more sanguine about it and some say the business climate is improving as a result
while the campaign by the government of communist party general secretary nguyen phu trong has slowed some dealmaking in a country already plagued by red tape and bureaucracy it has not deterred foreign investors from putting their money in vietnam
vietnam s economy grew percent last year the strongest pace since while foreign direct inflows hit record highs for two years in a row reaching billion in
to some foreign investors the crackdown was long overdue
nearly of vietnam s people have had to pay a bribe to get access to public services transparency international ti said in a report
out of asian countries surveyed only india fared worse
the drive is a good signal to many foreign investors said somhatai panichewa chief executive of amata vn pcl a unit of thailand s top industrial estate operator amata which in january announced major investments in vietnam
we think the government is serious about showing the public that investing in vietnam is no longer but about she said
some business risk analysts take a similar view
once the political thrust behind the arrests and their pattern could be more clearly identified confidence was restored in the government s commitment to courting foreign investment said brendan brady of consulting firm eurasia
that doesn t mean the business conditions are easy for foreign investors
executives on the ground have to navigate a minefield of new challenges said adam sitkoff executive director of the american chamber of commerce in hanoi
whether a result of corruption protectionism tax collection or the government trying to pick winners and losers our member companies often see areas where inconsistencies inefficiencies and unfair practices persist and in some cases new unfair practices are being enacted sitkoff said
the government did not respond to requests for comment on the fallout from the crackdown or the circumstances in which it was launched
over people mostly from enterprises soes in the banking or energy sectors have been prosecuted jailed and in some cases given death sentences in the campaign
government critics say the crackdown is politically motivated and has targeted those close to former prime minister nguyen tan dung who lost a power struggle in to communist party general secretary nguyen phu trong
but it has also shed light on graft mismanagement and nepotism within enterprises soes firms in the country at a time when a privatisation drive is accelerating
trinh xuan thanh a former chairman of a unit of the petrovietnam state energy group is now serving two life sentences for corruption after he fled the country and turned up in hanoi in bizarre circumstances
germany accused hanoi of kidnapping him in a style abduction in a berlin park last year
thanh s senior member dinh la thang was also sacked and became vietnam s official to have been jailed for decades
he was given years in prison and is again on trial facing another potential jail term
officials have been more cautious after the corruption crackdown said an executive of a small government enterprise who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject
there have been quite a lot of requirements to cut down costs recently some are required some are forced some are achieved via technology enhancements that cut down on electricity costs material costs etc the executive said
earlier this month one of vietnam s most sought after soes earmarked for privatisation telecoms firm mobifone was accused by a government investigating team of several violations in a bid to buy a percent stake in a private service called audio visual global
the government inspectors described the deal as negatively affecting mobifone s proposed privatisation and proposed handing over the case to police
the two sides called off the deal just before the results of the investigations were announced
mobifone has not responded to a request for comment
calls to audio visual global were not answered
the privatisation of mobifone has already been delayed for more than a decade and it could take even longer if the case is handed over to the police
vietnam has failed to meet its privatisation targets in previous years but has plans for over initial public offerings as well as partial stake sales in around companies by
it seems that managers of soes at least the most important ones are now more cautious in their activity in particular in relation to equitisation partial privatisation divestment and so on the european chamber of commerce said in a statement to reuters
the approval of line ministers is more systematically sought and the valuation of assets or shares is subject to more constraints
still as thang and thanh went on trial in january the government managed to raise about million from selling partial stakes in three petrovietnam units despite the corruption attached to its name
and last december the government raised a lofty billion from selling percent of brewer sabeco
