corrected-update 2-softbank vision fund, saudi arabia to create world's biggest solar power firm
new york reuters softbank group corp s vision fund will invest in creating the world s biggest solar power project in saudi arabia it said on tuesday stepping up its involvement in the kingdom and expanding beyond technology
the project is expected to have the capacity to produce up to gigawatts gw by softbank chief executive masayoshi son told reporters in new york
that would add to around gw of globally installed solar power capacity and is comparable to the world s total nuclear power capacity of around gw as of the end of
by investing in solar power saudi arabia the world s biggest oil exporter can reduce the amount of crude it currently uses to generate power and increase its overseas shipments
the move illustrates the commitment by the de facto saudi ruler crown prince mohammed bin salman to transform the country s economic status quo
the final investment total for the gw of generation including the solar panels battery storage and a manufacturing facility for panels in saudi arabia will eventually total around billion billion pounds son said
the initial phase of the project for gw of solar capacity will cost billion with billion coming from softbank s vision fund and the rest from project financing he said
saudi arabia s vision reform plan which aims to reduce the country s economic dependence on oil was a good match for the fund s vision for innovation said son
these two visions have come together to create clean sustainable and productive renewable energy he said
the kingdom has great sunshine great size of available land and great engineers despite being one of the world s sunniest countries saudi arabia generates most of its electricity from power plants
saudi s entire installed power capacity is currently around gw
adding gw would create enormous excess capacity that could be exported to neighbours or used by industry although the kingdom will still require other forms of power generation for
industry estimates say around to barrels per day of crude oil are burnt for saudi power generation
exporting that oil could increase saudi s annual oil revenues by between billion and billion at the current price for benchmark brent oil of almost per barrel
fuel saudi arabia is clearly preparing for a fuel dependent economy in terms of domestic energy consumption and this huge bet on renewables would free up a lot of domestic output of oil for exports while probably saving domestic gas resources as well said peter kiernan lead energy analyst at the economist intelligence unit in singapore
up until now progress in building solar capacity in the kingdom has been very slow but this deal might give it the kick start it needs
but gw by though that s another question kiernan said
last may softbank said it raised over billion for the vision fund the world s largest private equity fund with backers including saudi arabia s sovereign wealth fund apple inc and foxconn formally known as hon hai precision industry
the vision fund has funnelled billion into tech firms as of the end of december transforming softbank from a japanese telecoms upstart into one of the world s biggest technology investors
the saudi investment is softbank s second major global solar project
the company has said it will invest up to billion along with foxconn and bharti enterprises in solar projects in india which has an ambitious target to generate gw of power from solar by
softbank estimated the electrification drive could create a requirement for over gw of additional power
