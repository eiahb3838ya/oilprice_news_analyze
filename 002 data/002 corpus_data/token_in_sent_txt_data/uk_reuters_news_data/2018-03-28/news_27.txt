opec to stick to supply curbs despite oil rally to $71 - sources
reuters opec and its allies look set to keep their deal on cutting oil supplies for the rest of five sources familiar with the issue said although some producers are starting to worry that high prices may be giving too much stimulus to rival output
opec russia and several other producers have curbed output since january to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since
they have extended the pact until the end of and meet on june to review policy
the deal has boosted oil prices which topped a barrel this year for the first time since
they were close to on wednesday
but it has also encouraged a flood of shale oil fuelling a debate about how effective the curbs are
june will be a rollover until the meeting later in the year to make a decision for next year depending on market conditions an opec source from a major middle east producer said referring to the deal
the source said achieving a balance between supply and demand in the second half of was the most likely scenario if production demand and compliance levels stay as the chance of a significant tweak to the deal being agreed in june is low most opec delegates say
but some officials are privately talking about the issue a sign that prices have risen more strongly than expected
the level of oil prices from now until the june meeting is going to affect the decision at that time said a opec source who asked not to be identified by name
prices between and can support the continuation of the agreement for the rest of he said referring to benchmark brent crude
a very high price could convince the parties to the agreement to reconsider the deal has delivered an even bigger cut than called for mainly because of a drop in venezuelan production where output is collasping due to an economic crisis
compliance with the deal reached an unprecedented percent in february
another opec source also raised the possibility revising the agreement in june should the market become short of oil
but four more middle east delegates did not expect any changes
for any change to happen in june top exporter saudi arabia would have to be on board and there is no sign of that yet
saudi arabia says opec and its allies will need to continue cooperating on supply curbs not just for the rest of but into
the producers are working on a framework for future cooperation which they say will be discussed in june
saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman told reuters that riyadh and moscow were considering a deal to extend their alliance over many years
over the past year saudi arabia has emerged as opec s leading supporter of measures to boost prices a change from its more moderate stance in earlier years
it wants oil prices to trade at a barrel
industry sources have linked this shift to saudi arabia s desire to support the valuation of state oil company aramco in which the kingdom is planning to sell a minority stake
others in opec notably iran have lower price aspirations saying oil benefits alternative energy providers too much
iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh told the wall street journal in march that opec could agree in june to start easing the curbs in
he also said opec should aim for oil around to contain the growth of oil produced from shale
zanganeh later said opec was unlikely to agree to changes to the supply cut deal before the end of the year
