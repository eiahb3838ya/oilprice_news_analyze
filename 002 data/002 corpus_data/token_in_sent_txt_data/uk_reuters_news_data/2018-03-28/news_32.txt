singapore reuters european trader vitol is storing gasoline on tankers offshore singapore asia s biggest oil trading centre for the first time since amid oversupply and weak demand for the fuel said four people that participate in the market on wednesday

at least one of the vessels is the tanker glory crescent a tanker said one of the four sources
the vessel is deadweight tonnes and could carry the equivalent of about barrels of gasoline
according to data on thomson reuters eikon the glory crescent was fixed on by a charterer that was not revealed for a to time charter for storage
the aframax vessel is currently at anchor offshore the the data show
since the start of gasoline market has been in a contango structure where prices are lower than prices which is indicative of a weak market
this month the contango between march and april prices widened to as much as cents a barrel
typically traders can store fuel in a contango market in expectation of the later rising prices but the current contango does not justify according to the sources
the contango is not wide enough to encourage storing gasoline but vitol may have its own economics for doing so said one of the sources
in traders including vitol unipec total and gunvor were storing gasoline aboard vessels off singapore as the contango deepened to a barrel
so far vitol is the only company storing fuel the sources said
they were not expecting more to follow suit although the market remained saddled with supplies despite recent refinery outages in taiwan and ongoing refinery maintenance in north asia
the latest data from singapore s international enterprise ie showed that onshore light distillates stocks held in the week to tuesday were at a record of million barrels
over in europe gunvor litasco trafigura socar as well as vitol had already used vessels to store gasoline this month following slow demand for petrol from the united states
refinery runs in the atlantic basin are at elevated levels despite turnaround activities

overall gasoline demand in asia this year is expected to lag she added
the gasoline crack refers to the profit from refining a barrel of oil into petrol
