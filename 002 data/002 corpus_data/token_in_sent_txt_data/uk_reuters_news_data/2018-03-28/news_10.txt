poland says it should decide future of forest at centre of eu dispute
warsaw reuters poland should decide how it manages one of europe s last ancient forests in the years ahead not the eu s top court environment minister henryk kowalczyk said setting up a possible confrontation in one of a series of disputes with brussels
the european court of justice is due to rule in april on an eu complaint that warsaw s decision in to allow more commercial logging in bialowieza forest broke the bloc s laws
greenpeace and other campaign groups have said the logging allowed by warsaw is threatening the unesco world heritage site and its populations of european bison lynx and rare birds
poland s ruling law and justice party already at odds with brussels over judicial reforms has said it has the right to manage its own resources and the logging is needed to control a beetle infestation
kowalczyk told reuters he expected the court ruling would focus only on how poland the eu s biggest eastern member had managed the forest up to now
the court will not however indicate precisely future methods to protect the forest because it would be a transgression beyond its competence told reuters in an interview
if the court made any specific recommendations about the forest s future management particularly if it banned any logging then the government would have to discuss it he added
warsaw wanted to draw up its own protection plan for the forest he said
i expect that it will be a compromise between active and passive protection he added without spelling out how many trees would be removed under an active scheme
an adviser to the eu court said in february that poland s decision to increase logging in the forest did break eu law
while judges are not obliged to follow the adviser s recommendation they do so in most cases
separately kowalczyk said he was seeing some support in europe and beyond for plans backed by warsaw to let nations balance out their carbon dioxide emissions with absorption of greenhouse gases by forests
the plan would be discussed he said at climate talks that poland will host in december in its southern city of katowice the centre of the silesia region
the issue of absorbing emissions has its opponents which is why we realise that these talks will not be easy
we will discuss this first within the european union kowalczyk said
many countries want to focus more on cuts in emissions reckoning the idea of absorption is a sideshow favored by states such as poland
kowalczyk said he had received a clear declaration from china s special representative on climate change that beijing was interested in the scheme
the minister reiterated that poland wanted to reduce the share of coal in its electricity production to around percent by from around percent now
we will be moving slowly from coal to other sources but it is important that it is not too abrupt he added
