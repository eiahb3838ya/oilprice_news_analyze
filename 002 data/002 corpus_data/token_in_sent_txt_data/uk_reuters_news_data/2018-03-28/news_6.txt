london reuters royal dutch shell has filed a criminal complaint against a former senior employee over suspected bribes in the million sale of an oilfield in nigeria where the company is already under investigation over a separate deal
dutch prosecutors confirmed they had received the complaint against peter robinson a former vice president for africa
they said it would be included in an ongoing investigation into shell and italy s eni over the acquisition of a different nigerian oilfield known as opl
shell and eni deny any wrongdoing related to opl in which robinson is being prosecuted
a spokesman for shell said the two cases were unrelated
chiara padovani a lawyer representing robinson said in a statement he denied any allegations of misconduct
robinson has not been contacted by dutch authorities about any such complaint she added
our client regrets that an issue between him and his former employer has been drawn into the public domain
he has not been informed of the details of shell s complaint against him padovani said
shell said an internal investigation had found that robinson may have committed a crime during the sale of an onshore oilfield oil mining lease oml to local company neconde energy ltd in february
we suspect a crime may have been committed by our former employee peter robinson against shell in relation to the sale process for oil mining lease oml in nigeria in a shell spokesman said in a statement
we have filed a criminal complaint with the dutch authorities and are considering other steps we could in a statement neconde energy said it purchased its stake in the field following a competitive bidding round and made no payments to robinson shell or other companies in order to facilitate it
neconde completely denies any allegation or suspicion of kickback for the acquisition of its interest in oml and the statement credited to shell suggesting the contrary is untrue and most unfortunate the company said
robinson is one of a number of shell employees being prosecuted in milan over opl a case spanning several countries that involves nigerian government officials and oil executives in a billion sale of the offshore field
the new evidence was uncovered after investigators looking into opl raided a house in perth australia owned by robinson according to a source close to the process
the evidence included documents showing robinson had set up a company which was later linked to two swiss bank accounts set up in also under robinson s name the source said
shell suspects that the company and the accounts may have been used to process kickbacks the source said
in court filings the milan prosecutor requested that swiss authorities investigate and freeze two accounts opened at a geneva bank in the name of energy venture partners ltd to check their connection to robinson
reuters was unable to contact energy venture partners
shell the largest international oil producer in nigeria was looking methodically at other transactions in which robinson was involved the source said
the spokesman said shell had informed the department of justice and the securities and exchange commission about the offshore company and the accounts
swiss federal prosecutors have supplied information to authorities in italy and the netherlands probing alleged corruption related to oil contracts in nigeria the office of the attorney general said on wednesday
