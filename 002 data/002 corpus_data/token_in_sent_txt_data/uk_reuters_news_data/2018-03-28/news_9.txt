update 1-brazil court blocks inclusion of choice oil blocks in march round
adds detail on reason for court decision by marta nogueira rio de janeiro march reuters a brazilian court has blocked the inclusion of two top quality blocks in an oil auction this week the mining and oil ministry said on wednesday adding that it plans to include the areas in future auctions this year
oil secretary marcio felix said the government would seek to undo the decision without providing details
but he said success was unlikely before the round on thursday which will grant companies concessions to explore and produce in the areas
the move casts a big shadow over the auction by removing some of its most acreage
the two blocks withdrawn from thursday s auction are located in the offshore santos basin and boasted minimum signing bonuses of billion reais million and billion reias each
both areas were thought to include geology from brazil s coveted play where billions of barrels of oil are buried under thousands of feet of salt beneath the ocean floor
the blocks also lie close to the saturno block which is slated to be auctioned in june
by law blocks within the polygon must be auctioned through agreements where companies compete to offer the government the biggest share of profit oil after costs
felix said the court s rationale was centered on the fact that the government could make more money if it auctioned off the two areas through production sharing arrangements instead of concessions
