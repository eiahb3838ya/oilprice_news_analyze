u.s. oil producer costs climb with more drilling -fed survey
houston reuters oil and gas business activity continued to climb last quarter driven by an improved oilfield services sector but costs for goods and labor also rose the federal reserve bank of dallas said on wednesday in its quarterly energy survey
about percent of the energy firms surveyed in texas southern new mexico and northern louisiana reported increased activity from a year ago
during that time oil prices have climbed more than percent to near a barrel
about percent of the respondents reported an improved company outlook with over percent of oilfield services firms offering a better view for the future
the uptick in activity is driving up costs companies said with the fed s index for wages and benefits climbing to from last year
its index for service firms input costs rose by percent from a year ago and over percent from last quarter
despite higher costs the index for prices received for oilfield services fell to from a year ago
less than half of firms reported receiving higher prices and percent reported a decrease
e p companies are still holding service prices down at every turn
on the flip side our costs of goods fuel and wages are climbing every day
it is time for rate increases to ensure a profit and sustainability said one respondent
on average companies said they needed per barrel oil prices to profitably drill new wells over the prior year s breakeven
in the permian basin companies said they needed a barrel oil for new wells also up from last year
the higher breakevens come as companies are paying up for land
on wednesday concho resources said it would buy rival rsp permian in a deal valued at more than per acre
around percent of the firms reported increased uncertainty from last quarter driven partly by the trump administration s decision to tax steel imports
the recent uncertainty regarding steel tariffs has the potential to create a major immediate shortfall in upstream drill pipe and to add significantly to costs which would negatively impact the internal rate of return on many plays said one respondent who works for an oilfield services firm
the index for producer capital expenditures fell to from the previous year a signal that oil and gas producers may be heeding calls from investors to boost returns rather than expand drilling at all cost
