artist's 'pollution pods' highlight global air quality problem
london april thomson reuters foundation the dense smog of delhi and the haze of beijing cloud the sky as visitors sniff the air during a unique exhibition in london aimed at raising awareness of pollution
the new art installation allows people to experience different pollution levels using five domes that replicate the environments of the indian chinese and british capitals brazil s sao paulo and norway s tautra peninsula
british artist michael pinsky whose work often focuses on environmental issues told the thomson reuters foundation he wanted to make people stop and think about how their everyday actions impact the atmosphere
the idea of polar bears on a melting glacier wasn t something that makes people change their lifestyles
it s the things that affect them every day pinsky said in an interview at london s somerset house where the pollution pods are on display
for london we ve just focused entirely on diesel emissions because that s the primary cause of pollution
it exceeds any other form of the pods are climatically controlled and expose visitors to moderate levels of the different toxins from nitrogen dioxide in london to ethanol in sao paulo
the tautra dome contains the cleanest air
you re seeing a comparison between different cities and you can feel it and see it as you move from dome to dome
i think it s a really powerful way of bringing this issue to people s minds said south african visitor gillian benjamin
pinsky said the worst air quality was in the delhi pod reflecting the conditions of the indian capital
if exposed to levels recreated in the artwork residents in new delhi would shorten their lifespans by four years while those living in london would lose up to months of their lives he said
according to the world health organization more than percent of the world s population live in places where air pollution levels exceed its safe limits
nearly residents of london die prematurely every year as a result of exposure to air pollution a study by researchers at king s college london showed
delhi s state government has adopted measures in recent years including limiting car use and temporarily closing power plants
last november the city struggled with its worst pollution in nearly years
around a million children were forced to miss school as a result and thousands of workers reported illness
the pollution pods artwork is on display at somerset house until april and coincides with earth day on sunday
