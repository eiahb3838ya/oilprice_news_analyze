interview-sulphur scrubbers "no silver bullet" for shipping industry -wartsila
london reuters shipping industry hopes that sulphur scrubbers are a solution to compliance with drastic emissions reduction demanded by are somewhat misguided one of the world s biggest manufacturers of the equipment told reuters
the international maritime organization imo cut to the amount of sulphur the world fleet can emit will have massive implications for shippers oil refiners and even crude oil producers
scrubbers that strip sulphur as fuels are burned allows ships to continue using fuel oil and finland s wartsila marine solutions is taking in record orders as the deadline draws nearer
however sigurd jenssen the company s director of exhaust gas cleaning said that while the equipment has a major part to play there is no silver bullet to ensure the deadline is met
you can t equip ships in one year he said
wartsila installed scrubbers last year accounting for about a third of the market and jenssen said that fitting ships with scrubbers by is doable
but with a global fleet of about vessels travelling international routes according to brokers alphatanker a large number will have to turn to cleaner fuels
the international energy agency said on wednesday that there has not been enough investment in scrubbers and it is worried about the market s ability to meet demand for the marine fuel that will be needed by ships without scrubbers
the imo rules cut the maximum amount of sulphur emissions to percent from percent meaning that ships without scrubbers have to burn fuels such as marine gasoil or fuel oil
experts say this will cut fuel oil demand by anywhere from million barrels per day bpd to million bpd
jenssen said that percent of ships in korea a major hub were fitted with scrubbers last year and that the market to retrofit existing vessels is picking up quite rapidly
but at a cost of between million euros and million euros pounds to million pounds for the equipment alone jenssen said some ship owners are holding back
a lot of smaller players with balance sheets want to wait to see how the fuel market is moving as well he said
fitting a scrubber can take as little as days but a bespoke engineering plan is also required and the entire process can take up to a year
the lead time on the equipment is somewhere between months
but before you get to the point of ordering there s some investigations and work to be done that can easily take a couple more months jenssen said
as demand increases that time frame could get longer he added
