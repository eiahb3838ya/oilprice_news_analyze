update 3-german utility deal faces snag as macquarie eyes innogy assets - sources
reuters investor macquarie is interested in some assets of german energy firm innogy two people familiar with the matter said potentially disrupting plans by parent rwe to break up the group with rival
the news comes about a month after rwe which owns percent in innogy unveiled plans to split up the unit and share its assets with in one of the sector s most radical restructurings in recent history
a rival bid for some of innogy s assets would give the group a stronger hand in negotiations with the prospective future owner of its networks and retail units which has flagged as many as job cuts as part of the deal
macquarie and innogy both declined to comment
rwe said it would continue with the proposed deal with which it said offered shareholders and employees the best prospects
breaking up and selling innogy in pieces is not an alternative for rwe it said in a statement
a separate source said the assets macquarie is eyeing are worth a low billion euro amount
it was not clear whether this includes offshore wind park project triton knoll which sources say has also attracted macquarie s interest
innogy earlier said it had received a request from a suitor it did not name adding it had granted due diligence for its czech activities
it said the suitor also expressed interest in certain parts of innogy s renewables retail and networks units
discussions are at an early stage and at this point in time it is open whether and on what terms offers for individual business activities will be submitted innogy said
business paper handelsblatt first reported macquarie as the bidder
shares in rwe and fell following the news and were down percent and percent respectively at gmt
innogy shares were percent lower at euros below the euros will offer minority owners as part of the deal with rwe
with a regulated asset base of billion euros billion innogy is the largest gas distribution networks operator in the czech republic and already shares ownership of that business with macquarie which holds just below percent
innogy also has million power and gas customers in the country about percent of the group s total
if macquarie ends up buying some of innogy s assets it could mean the complex plans by and rwe might have to be changed said thomas hechtfischer managing director of shareholder advisory group dsw
what happens if the innogy pie gets smaller and smaller
everything has been calculated and valued
it certainly wouldn t get any additional reporting by arno schuetze editing by maria sheahan and mark potter
