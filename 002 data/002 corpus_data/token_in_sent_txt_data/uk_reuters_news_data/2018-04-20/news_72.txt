feature-as drought saps hydropower, steam may keep kenya boiling along
nairobi april thomson reuters foundation in february kenyans awoke to news that has become an annual ritual authorities were considering temporarily shutting down hydropower dams the country s largest source of electricity
the reason was the one given each dry season for the last four years too long without rain had left too little water in reservoirs to turn the turbines and generate power
kenya power the national electricity utility has so far always managed to avoid a full shutdown instead turning off just a few turbines at a time
but to make up the gap it has turned to more expensive and polluting diesel generators to keep the country plugged in
now however another clean source of power may help fill the gap geothermal power
over more than a decade kenya has invested over billion in tapping the country s underground steam including a million loan from japan to develop geothermal wells that are expected to come online in with megawatts mw of new power
the country already gets about mw of the electricity it needs from geothermal power about a quarter of its total needs which makes kenya africa s largest geothermal producer and the eighth largest in the world according to the country s energy regulatory commission
with new green power being added from geothermal solar and wind energy hydropower now accounts for just percent of the country s energy mix down from around percent a decade ago according to energy principal secretary joseph njoroge
that has helped shore up power supplies and hold the line on prices said isaac kiva the renewable energy secretary in the energy ministry
kenya s decision over the years to invest in geothermal energy has ensured relative stability in power supply to consumers allowing as well relative stability in electricity costs he said in response to email questions
kenya has tapped less than percent of the geothermal energy it would like to
experts say that reserves of steam in kenya s rift valley region could generate up mw double the target set by the government s vision development plan
geothermal could help many countries in east africa tap into more sustainable reliable and clean energy in a region that is facing worsening droughts linked to climate change and strained hydropower production
the east africa region is estimated to have a geothermal potential of more than mw of electricity according to the african rift geothermal development facility argeo a project of the united nations environment programme
it believes kenya and ethiopia lead in terms of geothermal potential with mw each
the next countries djibouti tanzania and uganda range from mw to mw according to argeo figures
geothermal could generate nearly half of tanzania s current installed electricity capacity more than half of uganda s and more than double ethiopia s the project noted
exploring for and developing geothermal energy has high initial costs a problem shared by many renewable energy technologies
but once in place geothermal provides for a cheap source of energy to many countries said adnan amin head of the international renewable energy agency in an interview with the thomson reuters foundation
amin noted that kenya had seen an overall drop of percent in electricity tariffs in the last few years despite hydropower shortages
costs as high as million to drill a single geothermal exploration well can deter countries from investing amin said
but improving technology and better investment models should help cut the cost in the future he said
in kenya for instance government investment in geothermal exploration and test drilling combined with offers to buy geothermal power at attractive rates has made it easier and less risky for private investors to step in amin said
that s one reason kenya now has more than mw of geothermal power and ethiopia only mw though ethiopia is now moving to develop mw of geothermal power amin said
joseph kabyemera head of the african development bank s climate development fund said countries could speed up adding geothermal power to their energy mix by tapping into things like the geothermal risk mitigation fund for east africa
the facility established by the african union aims to encourage government and private investment in geothermal power by providing grants for studies to find the best well locations and test drilling
