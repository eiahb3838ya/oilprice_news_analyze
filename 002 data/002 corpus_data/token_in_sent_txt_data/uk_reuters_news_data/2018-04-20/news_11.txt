trump tells opec oil has rallied too far confused opec ministers say they helped oil industry trump iranian saudi policies in focus by rania el gamal alex lawler and dmitry zhdannikov april reuters with oil prices hitting per barrel it was meant to be one of the smoothest meetings opec has had in recent years
the night before the meeting the ministers gathered in jeddah celebrated with a traditional saudi sword dance just as president donald trump had done when he visited saudi arabia last may
little did they know that trump was about to spoil their party when he tweeted that oil prices had rallied too far
looks like opec is at it again
with record amounts of oil all over the place including the fully loaded ships at sea
oil prices are artificially very high
no good and will not be accepted trump said on twitter
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries is in the midst of an oil deal with producers like russia that has helped erase a global glut and boosted oil prices to their highest since
oil prices fell on trump s tweet as market analysts tried to interpret what it could mean for policies
ministers and delegates were having lunch at the time to celebrate opec secretary general mohammad barkindo s birthday when delegates were alerted to trump s tweet
we in opec pride ourselves as friends of the united states barkindo told reporters when emerging from the lunch and asked for his response to the tweet
an opec source said delegates were confused by trump s stance higher oil prices helped the oil industry and the americans themselves
the oil industry would have collapsed if it wasn t for this opec deal
uae s energy minister suhail mohamed said prices were not artificially high
asked whether he thought it was fair that the president was getting involved in opec matters he said jokingly since when is it about fairness trump a regular twitter user has never tweeted about opec before although he has regularly attacked cartels that control prices
the united states is on course to become the world s largest oil producer but it has never participated in opec meetings due to tough legislation
reuters reported this week that saudi arabia would be happy to see crude rise even higher to or even a barrel a sign riyadh will seek no changes to the deal at a june meeting to set policy
ole hansen of saxo bank said oil had risen to current levels in part because of the risk trump might pull the out of an iranian nuclear deal thus curbing iranian oil exports
rapidan energy thinktank said trump s tweet would initially push russia and saudi arabia closer together and assist riyadh s attempts to prolong oil supply cuts
but the intensifying clash will impact relations iran sanctions discussions on civilian nuclear cooperation and a host of other issues it added
