london reuters formerly skeptical investors are buying back into oil majors in the hope that upcoming results will mark a turning point for energy stocks which have failed to keep pace with a surge in crude prices
oil stocks could begin to close that gap if results live up to lofty expectations with goldman sachs predicting the strongest free cash flow figures in a decade for the sector
oil is the global asset this year with brent crude up percent since january but energy stocks have continued to lag the commodity
while europe s oil and gas sector is the it still has a way to go to catch up with crude
the gap between returns from brent crude and from msci s global energy index from the start of has widened to percentage points

cash flows are growing rapidly dividends are very good and you re starting to get some buybacks he said
the fact higher oil prices have not yet trickled down into shares leaves a lot of room for gains
with oil prices currently at a barrel europe s exploration and production firms are pricing in a oil price of just per barrel barclays analysts estimate

the newfound religion and confidence in the sector is to say the least fragile he added
there are at least some new converts
eric moore an income fund manager at miton group who used to be wary of oil stocks due to dividend yields he saw as dangerously high has now moved to an overweight on the sector
with the rise in oil prices that we ve seen the sustainability of the dividends is better he said

earnings estimates have recovered to their highest since
and these bigger cash piles should translate into dividend increases

a dividend hike is forever morgan stanley analysts wrote
the fundamentals of the oil market are also convincing investors that the crude price surge is more than just a blip

an oil price toward the at the end of the year allows the offshore to start again
it s desperately needed he said
some of the larger exploration and production e p firms such as aker lundin and tullow oil which are more sensitive to the oil price trade at a premium to the sector
barclays analysts say these stocks performance will depend on the extent to which investors risk venturing out of the bigger oil firms in search of higher leverage to crude
miton s moore for example owns shares in e p firm premier oil in order to have geared exposure to the rise in crude prices balancing out his holdings in shell and bp which are less sensitive to it
