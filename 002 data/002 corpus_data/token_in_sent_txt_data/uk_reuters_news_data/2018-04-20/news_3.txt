update 6-trump rails against high oil prices, opec pushes back
saudi arabia reuters president donald trump accused opec on friday of artificially boosting oil prices drawing rebukes from some of the world s top energy exporters
looks like opec is at it again
with record amounts of oil all over the place including the fully loaded ships at sea
oil prices are artificially very high
no good and will not be accepted trump wrote on twitter
it was unclear what triggered the tweet trump s first mention of opec on social media during his term
oil prices are near a high at close to a barrel and have been rising since opec and producers including russia cut supply in january to end a global oil glut and price collapse
trump s tweet came shortly after officials from top oil exporter saudi arabia said they would like to see prices climb even higher and that they were still far from their goal of ending the supply glut
the cartel is expected to restrain supply through the end of this year and possibly into
three saudi officials told reuters this week they would be happy to see oil hit or a barrel
higher prices drive up gasoline prices for motorists worldwide and rising energy costs feed inflation
but higher oil prices have also benefitted the energy industry feeding rapid growth in output from shale fields
oil output is at record levels
despite trump s comments oil benchmarks ended the day modestly higher rebounding from early losses
several members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries responded to the tweet saying prices were not artificially inflated
delegates at an monitoring committee meeting in jeddah saudi arabia said oil prices were higher partially because of global political tensions mentioning sanctions on venezuela threats to the iran nuclear agreement strikes on syria and over north korea
opec secretary general mohammed barkindo said the output cut agreement halted the collapse in global oil prices and is on course to restore stability on a sustainable basis in the interest of producers consumers and the global we don t have any price objective in opec and not in this joint endeavour with barkindo said on friday in response to trump s tweet
the group is next slated to meet in june to discuss output policy
ministers from both iraq and the united arab emirates also disagreed with trump on friday with iraqi oil minister jabar saying prices are not very high and that the market is stabilizing
trump gave no details on what action his administration might take regarding oil or opec and the white house did not respond to elaborate on the issue on the record
we have a difficult time seeing how opec would in any way be swayed here in terms of changing course in terms of policy said michael tran commodity strategist at rbc
opec s output fell in march to an low according to a reuters survey
the cartel has targeted the average of inventories in organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries as a barometer for the deal s success
as of those inventories were billion barrels or million more than the average a year ago it was million barrels above that benchmark
this week crude futures benchmarks brent and west texas intermediate wti hit their highest since november with brent touching and crude per barrel
that has raised fuel costs with average prices for gasoline hitting a gallon on wednesday according to motorist advocacy group aaa up more than cents from a year earlier and at their highest since july
trump is just trying to relate to his base when it comes to the retail gasoline prices so he s blaming opec for this said josh graves senior market strategist at rjo futures in chicago
beyond opec s supply management crude prices have been supported by expectations that washington will sanctions on iran and might expand sanctions against venezuela after that country s presidential election next month
if one concern about reinstating sanctions on iranian oil is the impact that it could have on oil prices then it could be a preemptive measure to blame opec instead said antoine halff senior research scholar at the center on global energy policy at columbia university
hedge funds and other speculators hold a record level of bullish bets on brent on expectations of further price rises
the government can not legally influence oil prices other than through releasing oil from its strategic reserve which it does occasionally
this year s budget agreement includes the sale of about million barrels of crude oil about percent of the reserve as oil production recently hit a record at more than million barrels a day
that release is not related to high oil prices and analysts said it signalled washington was not concerned about the potential for future global shortages
washington has fully given up this idea of scarcity
you don t get to the point of selling your strategic reserves to balance your budget if you think the world is short said kevin book managing director at clearview energy partners
