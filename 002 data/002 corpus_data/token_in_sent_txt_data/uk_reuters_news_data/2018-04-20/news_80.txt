goldman sees strong oil demand through 2018
april reuters goldman sachs said it expects global oil demand growth to remain strong this year and contribute to further declines in oil inventories
we believe that the combination of strong developed markets momentum and accelerating emerging markets growth will combine to keep oil demand growth above consensus expectations with our year on year forecast at million barrels per day goldman said in a note dated thursday
global oil demand in has come in line with its optimistic expectations with the first quarter likely to post the strongest year on year growth since fourth quarter at the bank said
while global oil data for supports our constructive demand outlook for the year we expect march data will show weaker demand growth given transient seasonal distortions and unusually cold temperatures could have resulted in softer march data the bank said adding that was likely just a transient weakness as strong refinery margins supported its view of robust demand in april
goldman however said volatile chinese data slowdown in global demand growth in march ongoing trade tensions and fears that higher oil prices will start to weigh on demand growth have led to increased concern about the sustainability of demand strength
