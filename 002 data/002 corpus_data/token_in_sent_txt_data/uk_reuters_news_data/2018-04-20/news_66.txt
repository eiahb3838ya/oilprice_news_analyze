update 3-china's private chemical giant hengli wins approval for crude oil quota
hengli to start trial runs at refinery in oct plant aims to buy saudi crude oil hengli has applied for fuel export quota could pose challenge to smaller independent plants adds analyst comment source comment on domestic fuel marketing by meng meng and chen aizhu beijing april reuters chinese private chemical producer hengli group has won state approval to import barrels per day bpd crude oil the largest quota ever for a private refiner as it challenges the country s smaller independent plants in an oversupplied chinese fuel market
the group s listed unit hengli petrochemical said in an exchange filing late on thursday that the national development and reform commission ndrc the state economic planner had approved the quota
the firm aims to start trial runs in october at a newly built refinery in the northeastern port city of dalian that will be among the five biggest refineries in china
we will start using our quota this year said a senior hengli official who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media
we hope to get enough allowances for the refinery to start trial operations in another private chemical firm zhejiang ronsheng group is also expected to start operating a new refinery in the eastern city of zhoushan later this year
the additional production capacity in china is likely to add to pressure on the country s small independent or teapot refineries which are vulnerable to increased competition because of their modest output
many teapot refineries produce less than bpd
hengli s scale sophisticated refinery configuration that favors petrochemicals and its location means it will be a killer competitor to teapots said harry liu of consultancy ihs markit
with the government stepping up scrutiny over their tax and environmental practices liu predicted some of the smaller of the independents close in the next two years as a result of the competition
hengli started as a small chemical fiber maker and operates a million tonnes per year plant making purified terephthalic acid pta the world s largest
pta is a feedstock for producing polyester
although the ndrc grants approval for quotas the commerce ministry determines how much of a quota can be put to use
for next year we are confident of getting million tonnes of allowances from the government the senior hengli official said
he said the refinery s two crude distillation units cdu are designed to process percent of saudi arabia s arab medium crude percent of saudi heavy and percent qatar marine crude
the company has recently applied for a quota to export fuel oil
the senior hengli official and another company official said hengli would market its refined fuel to sinopec and petrochina as well as independent wholesalers and distributors
there is no plan to build its own retailing network because of the cost
in january hengli signed a framework deal with sinochem group to cooperate on imports of crude oil and the marketing of refined fuel
