update 5-australia vows crackdown on corporate misconduct as bank inquiry claims amp scalp
sydney reuters an australian inquiry into financial sector misconduct claimed its first scalp on friday as the ceo of the country s largest wealth manager stepped down over revelations of deception and misappropriation of funds
the departure of amp ltd s craig meller came as the government vowed to double prison terms for financial crimes dramatically increase penalties and ramp up the investigative powers of the corporate regulator following shocking admissions of misconduct to the royal commission inquiry
not only has the start of the inquiry been a publicity disaster for australia s major lenders it has also put the conservative government which had initially opposed a commission despite years of scandals including and alleged in a tight spot
faced with daily revelations of wrongdoing at the highest levels of corporate australia the government is now under mounting pressure to extend the inquiry beyond its february deadline meaning it would run concurrently with the next federal election
treasurer scott morrison who once dismissed opposition calls for a royal commission as crass populism on friday said the government would raise criminal penalties for corporate crimes to a maximum of years in jail from years currently
offending companies would face fines up to a million million versus a million now
australian securities and investments commission asic would get the power to intercept internal communications of companies if necessary morrison said
they are not victimless crimes morrison told a press conference
we need to set the tone so people understand that misleading regulators about serious issues such as this is no victimless offence and it won t carry a victimless the changes were the result of years of planning and were not a reaction to the inquiry he said
amp executives admitted in testimony this week that the company had lied to the corporate watchdog for almost a decade to cover a practice of charging customers for services it did not provide
chairman catherine brenner issued an unreserved apology for misconduct and failures in regulatory disclosures in our advice business as she announced meller s exit along with a review of the company s governance
government data prepared for the royal commission which has the power to subpoena documents and compel top executives to testify in public shows more than consumers have been given bad advice by financial institutions over the past decade costing them a total a billion billion
this week s hearings have been particularly brutal
a nurse gave tearful testimony on thursday about losing her home after taking advice from westpac banking corp while lawyers presented evidence that commonwealth bank of australia the country s biggest bank knowingly charged dead clients for counsel for years
but the revelations about amp for the first time showed direct involvement in hiding misconduct from asic leading to calls for the watchdog to play a far more aggressive role than it has in the past
the australian shareholders association said meller s resignation was not sufficient and called for brenner to explain the board s involvement in the case or step down
the asa wants to ask catherine brenner about the reported interference with the production of the independent report it said in a statement
if this is not able to be provided her position as chair is untenable and she should resign said the asa
the asa is having further discussions with the company to assess how rigorous these directors are in dealing with the ongoing issues it added
the association represented about shareholders at the last amp annual general meeting the asa website shows
amp shares have lost over a billion in market value since the revelations came to light on tuesday
the stock ended down percent on friday in a weak overall market
meller said he was personally devastated by the issues which have been raised publicly this week and while he did not condone making misleading statements to the regulator they had occurred under his watch so his resignation was appropriate
this is not the amp i know and these are not the actions our customers should expect from the amp director mike wilkins a former ceo of australia s biggest general insurer insurance australia group ltd will step in as amp s acting chief until a permanent replacement for meller is found the company added
