rpt-insight-the great russian oil game in iraqi kurdistan
repeats story published on thursday aggressive sechin tactics cement rosneft s influence sources oil company seen as instrument of russian foreign policy rosneft has struck deals from erbil to caracas and new delhi graphic of kurdistan oil map by dmitry zhdannikov london april reuters last october at the height of a political crisis in iraq s kurdistan region a letter arrived at the iraqi oil ministry in baghdad from igor sechin head of kremlin oil major rosneft
the baghdad government was showing a lack of constructive position and interest about rosneft s offer to develop southern iraqi oilfields sechin wrote in the letter a copy of which was seen by reuters
kurdistan a region of about million people in northern iraq had just tried and failed to break away from the rest of the country
baghdad had dismissed the independence referendum and sent in troops to seize control of key oilfields kurdistan s main source of income
now sechin one of the closest allies of president vladimir putin said that given baghdad s reluctance to work with rosneft his firm would instead do business with the kurdistan regional government krg which showed a higher interest in expanding strategic cooperation
global powers including the united states and european union which had previously expressed sympathy with the kurdish independence drive would eventually reassure baghdad they recognised its sovereignty over the whole of iraq including kurdistan
but there was no hint of such conciliation in sechin s letter
rosneft had pledged to invest billions of dollars in kurdistan to the anger of the baghdad government
now instead of backing off it was doubling down
and sechin held a stronger hand than many iraqi officials realised according to seven sources familiar with the matter
days before rosneft had taken over ownership of landlocked kurdistan s oil export pipelines to turkey from the krg in return for billion
the aim of the deal for rosneft was not only commercial but to cement russia s political influence in iraq and the middle east according to the rosneft oil industry kurdish and iraqi government sources
control of the pipelines has given rosneft a central role in ongoing talks between the krg and baghdad aimed at resuming full oil exports which were disrupted by the referendum and iraqi seizure of oilfields said the sources
kurdistan has large oil reserves possibly a third of iraq s total and its exports are vital to both the regional and national economies
in a sign of rosneft s influence kurdish officials have said they will not restart oil flows and transfer funds raised to the iraqi government unless pipeline transit fees are paid to the russian oil major according to three industry sources in erbil and baghdad
iraqi oil minister jabar effectively recognised the firm s growing role in kurdistan when he met sechin s man didier casimiro in baghdad this month and said he was ready to cooperate with rosneft in renovating pipelines
rosneft sechin the kremlin and the iraq s prime minister s office did not respond to requests for comment on this story
sechin and the kremlin have repeatedly said rosneft s projects are purely commercial not political
the iraqi oil ministry declined to comment on any political aspects of the rosneft deal
rosneft s actions in kurdistan a region long allied to the united states provide an insight into how the kremlin uses rosneft and its bold chief executive as an instrument of russian foreign policy across the world from erbil to caracas and new delhi the sources said
many countries including italy and france have used their oil majors as tools of foreign policy but moscow s use of rosneft in this way has increased significantly over the past two decades under putin s rule
for kurdistan russia s growing influence represents a sharp geopolitical reversal
the region has been closely aligned to the united states since the toppling of saddam hussein during the invasion of iraq in
amos hochstein who served as the special energy envoy in the obama administration said while rosneft and other russian state firms sought to make profits they also acted as a political entities when necessary
they report directly to president putin
not every transaction that they do is political
but when putin wants to perform a political transaction they will definitely do it he told reuters
russia doesn t have a lot of tools to exercise political influence and energy is the most efficient one
baghdad which does not recognise the deal for the pipelines has found itself in a difficult situation
the iraqi government s finances have been strained by its battle with islamic state so it has little money to build new pipelines from kurdistan while it is loath to significantly disrupt the region s oil flows which it is banking on to deliver revenue
the role played by rosneft in furthering kremlin foreign policy is not unique to iraq and has also played out in other parts of the world according to the rosneft and industry sources
sechin behaves like a second russian foreign minister
or to put it differently he represents the economic might behind russian foreign policies said one of the industry sources an acquaintance of the rosneft boss
very often these policies are about poking the americans right in the in venezuela rosneft lent around billion to support the government
the company could end up owning large texan refineries currently belonging to venezuelan state oil firm pdvsa because the plants are collateral against the debt
in india rosneft invested billion in a refinery an abnormally high price for an oil processing complex as it sought to outbid saudi firm aramco and boost russian ties with the country traditionally allied with the united states
sechin said earlier this year in a rare interview with frankfurter allgemeine zeitung he was confident that both venezuela and kurdistan would repay their debts in full and denied the deals were political
asked if he saw himself as a politician the responded it is a difficult question
it often feels like i have already lived several different lives
i think the right word is a born in st petersburg he was sent in the to act as a military interpreter in mozambique and angola where moscow and washington were fighting proxy wars
putin who had known sechin since the early in st petersburg took him to moscow when he rose to power
sechin helped him nationalise much of the russian oil industry and was appointed rosneft ceo in
the kurds have long argued that as an autonomous region of iraq they have the authority to make agreements with foreign companies about pumping oil in their territory
in they started independent oil exports via turkey
iraq s central government however says any kurdish deals with overseas firms or to export oil from kurdistan are illegal without baghdad s blessing
russia was the only major world power that did not oppose the referendum saying it understood kurdish aspirations for independence
the united states eu turkey and iran all urged erbil to cancel or postpone the vote in the weeks before it
as state secretary rex tillerson unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a delay to the independence vote sechin was busy negotiating the pipelines deal
in the days following the referendum kurdish officials including natural resources minister ashti hawrami were flown to moscow to meet rosneft executives and russian foreign ministry officials according to two of the sources
on at the peak of the chaos when iraqi shiite militia backed by iranian troops ousted kurdish peshmerga forces from kirkuk oilfields sechin closed the deal
rosneft paid the last tranche of the billion deal sum to erbil the sources said
rosneft and sechin both subject to western sanctions over russia s annexation of crimea have never disclosed how much the company paid for the pipelines
