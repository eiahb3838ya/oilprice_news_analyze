update 1-steag expects more deals in germany after rwe-e.on swap
essen germany reuters local utility steag expects more mergers and acquisitions in germany s energy market following a landmark deal between and rwe to break up renewables and networks group innogy
the energy sector is seeing the next step of consolidation steag s ceo joachim rumstadt said at the company s annual press conference on thursday adding utilities had realised the need to focus and not cover the complete value chain
innogy s breakup announced last month will see rwe become europe s wind power player while turns into the continent s largest power and gas networks group
rumstadt said there were foreign utilities in germany looking to sell their power plants while other power firms were interested in entering the german market not disclosing any names
sources previously told reuters that france s engie was looking to sell its german power plants and that rwe was talking to local peer enbw about some of its assets
rumstadt also said that steag which is owned by seven municipalities in germany s industrial ruhr heartland in north as well as some of its power plants had attracted outside interest including on possible partnerships declining to comment further
rwe is not in talks with steag about its power plant assets a spokeswoman for the group said confirming similar remarks to newspaper rheinische post
steag saw its sales rise by about percent to billion euros billion last year while its operating profit ebit jumped percent to million euros
the group expects this year s ebit to fall by about percent hit by lower profits in conventional power generation
