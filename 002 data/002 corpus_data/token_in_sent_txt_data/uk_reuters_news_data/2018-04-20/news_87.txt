rpt-japan carbon capture site shows promise for industrial use
repeats item with no changes to text tomakomai test site to store t of by site aims to show ccs can work for industrial uses japan ccs says mln simulation shows method viable by aaron sheldrick tomakomai japan april reuters a test site in japan for burying carbon dioxide below the seabed off hokkaido island is showing more promise than other carbon capture and storage ccs projects by cutting costs and increasing efficiency its developer says
while the million site at tomakomai port represents a small portion of the billion invested in ccs it has potential for easing emissions from industries such as gas processing and cement and chemical production
most investments into ccs have focused on capturing carbon from power plants fired by coal and other fossil fuels the largest source of emissions but there have been big setbacks and some projects cancelled
tomakomai is an exciting development
progress on ccs has been far too slow and projects like that are very encouraging said graham winkelman climate change lead at bhp
industrial applications such as that being tested at the tomakomai site are where the focus now is on ccs he said
bhp is the world s largest exporter of coal for a fuel and industry often marked as big sources of emissions
on an exclusive tour of the tomakomai test site developers told reuters they have cut energy costs by as much as compared with other projects and increased the efficiency of capturing
those claims have yet to be tested commercially but the project operated by japan ccs owned by japan petroleum exploration mitsubishi corp jxtg holdings and more than other companies looks promising
in contrast southern co s kemper power station in the united states was to use ccs in an attempt to get clean power from coal but was abandoned after billions of dollars of investment
chevron corp has also delayed the world s largest injection operation in australia after spending a billion billion on the project at its gorgon liquefied natural gas plant itself beset by many problems
ccs involves separating from other materials and gases and injecting it underground to prevent it from escaping into the atmosphere or to use it to create pressure to push oil to the surface as wells deplete
at tomakomai gas is piped from a nearby idemitsu kosan refinery and pulled out as it passes through an amine solution
by using the remaining gases to generate power and recycling heat energy costs are cut to between and of a typical extraction plant the company said
when reuters visited the site a counter showed tonnes of had been injected halfway to the project s targeted tonnes
the injection project is scheduled to run until with no decision yet on commercial operations
asked about costs officials declined to state figures
japan ccs has run simulations scaling the site to handle million tonnes a year and these show it can make commercial sense said chiyoko suzuki manager of international relations at japan ccs during the visit
australia s carbonnet looking at a similar type of ccs project last year estimated the cost of compressing transporting and burying carbon dioxide from gas processing fertiliser manufacturing and hydrogen production at a a tonne
suzuki said he did not know carbonnet s details so could not make a judgement
ccs will be needed to cut percent of the emissions that have to be abated by to limit a global rise in average temperatures to less than celsius fahrenheit the international energy agency says
