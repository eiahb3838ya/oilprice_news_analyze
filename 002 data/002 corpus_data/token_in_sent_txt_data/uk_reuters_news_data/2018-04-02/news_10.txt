update 1-china tariffs on u.s. ethanol to cut off imports in short-term
updates with trader quote price reaction in paragraph beijing april reuters chinese buyers of ethanol will have to cut imports because of higher tariffs but eventually will have to return to the overseas market to meet government targets for using the fuel industry participants and analysts said on monday
china said late on sunday it will slap an extra percent tariff on ethanol imports from the united states part of its response to duties on aluminium and steel imports
the previous duty was percent
the tariffs effective monday will neutralize cost savings from importing cheaper ethanol versus domestic supply said three sources that participate in the market
ethanol an alcohol typically produced from corn or sugar is often mixed with gasoline to reduce air pollution from vehicle emissions
the price difference is gone
we will suspend imports for now said a manager at a private oil refinery adding that he was considering turning to domestic suppliers for ethanol to blend into gasoline
that is good news for domestic producers who are already ramping up output on cheaper corn and government subsidies
we have so much corn
we will do absolutely fine if we don t import ethanol said a manager at a major ethanol producer in china
but analysts said china will probably need to resume imports to meet the government target of percent ethanol content in all gasoline nationwide by
demand for fuel ethanol will potentially explode in and and we won t have enough domestic supplies by then
we might have to turn to overseas said michael mao an analyst with zhuochuang a commodities consultancy based in the chinese province of shandong
china said last year the new ethanol mandate would boost industrial demand for corn and help clean up its choking smog
it would mean consumption of around million tonnes of ethanol annually made from million tonnes of corn according to reuters calculations
china s current ethanol production is around million tonnes a year
it is not clear where future imports will come from
a percent duty on ethanol imports previously levied since january had already slowed a trade to a trickle
imports had recently picked up after prices fell enough to be attractive even with the high duties
but the new tariffs will close the arbitrage again boosting the price of ethanol to around yuan per tonne after taxes on par with domestic prices market sources said
there s not a lot booked past may now and there s a fear they are not going to book anything forward a ethanol trader said of china
chicago board of trade may ethanol futures fell percent or about cents to per gallon the lowest since as trade resumed after the tariff announcement
the refinery manager said prices in brazil the world s top ethanol producer are currently too high for exports to china but could be an option in future
