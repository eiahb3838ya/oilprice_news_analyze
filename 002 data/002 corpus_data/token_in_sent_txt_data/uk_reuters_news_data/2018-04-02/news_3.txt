crude lost or percent to settle at its lowest since march
trade sources told reuters on monday that saudi arabia was expected to cut prices for all crude grades it sells to asia in may to reflect weaker prices for its middle east benchmark dubai crude
there is speculation that the saudis are going to lower prices for their asian customers said bob yawger director of energy futures at mizuho in new york
that is not really the kind of thing you do when you want to keep production cuts in production cuts by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and russia have lifted oil prices in the past year

he gave european signatories a may deadline to fix the deal
