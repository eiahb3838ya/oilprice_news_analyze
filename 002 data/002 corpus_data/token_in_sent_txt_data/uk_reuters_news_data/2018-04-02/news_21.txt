analysis-latin american nations compete for capital in surge of oil auctions
houston reuters for decades many latin america s nations have often shunned investment from foreign firms instead keeping their vast reserves under the tight control of governments and oil companies
they aimed to protect profits to feed public budgets but in practice have seen some major breakdowns as with the corruption scandals and heavy debts at brazil s petroleo brasileiro sa or the inability of mexico s pemex to conjure the cash and expertise to tap its vast deepwater reserves
now an unprecedented wave of energy reforms is gaining traction across the region setting up a fierce competition to attract billions of dollars in investment from the likes of exxon mobil bp and royal dutch shell
seven governments this year will combine to hold at least oil and gas auctions offering a record blocks of onshore or offshore acreage according to interviews with officials and a tally of announced auctions
on thursday brazil s latest auction collected billion in pledges awarding of regions on offer
in countries in the region will host the most licensing rounds in history said pablo medina vice president of energy consultancy welligence
for a graphic on latin american oil auctions see the race for private investment reflects an acknowledgment by many countries that they have neither the cash nor the technology to fully explore and develop their reserves
the embrace of foreign capital in argentina brazil and ecuador also follows the rise of centrist or governments
it also signals a willingness by governments to settle for a smaller cut of the profits which could be slimmed further by the competition to attract investment as governments offer tax incentives reduced royalties and other inducements
the glaring exception is venezuela where pdvsa remains under the firm control of a leftist government in the throes of an economic and political meltdown
elsewhere emerging reforms are giving oil majors and independent producers their pick of some of the region s richest resources after being shut out of these markets or waiting years for the right moment to invest
but they also face a risk that governments could shift back to resource nationalization or lose the political will to fully establish market reforms
an oil price drop could also undermine profits from such expensive projects
we love this continent
we know it well and now need to make sure we will spend the money wisely said michel hourcard senior vice president of development exploration and production at france s total during an industry conference in houston last month
the regulatory changes in latin america include tax breaks reduced royalties longer contracts relaxed qualification terms and flexible exploration mandates that allow companies to back out of investments more easily than in the past
brazil and colombia also plan to set up permanent offers of areas for exploration and production similar to those offered by the united states rather than making them available only in occasional auctions
ecuador is offering agreements that are potentially more lucrative for oil firms than contracts that prevented companies from benefiting from oil price gains
countries have to present terms attractive enough to draw bidders back to the region said julie wilson research director of global exploration at consultancy wood mackenzie
strong participation by oil majors in recent auctions of exploration and production rights in mexico and brazil have heralded a new era by attracting about billion in investment pledges
brazil started its effort to lure outside capital two decades ago but it fell flat after initially enticing more than companies said decio oddone head of brazil s oil regulator
the effort was stymied by too few areas offered for auction the low quality of some projects and the dominant role of petrobras
many of those companies did not have the expected success oddone said
now brazil is relaxing bidding rules to encourage local firms and foreign explorers to participate joining majors already established in its vast region
in mexico political risks hampered its most recent auction in march where bidding was dominated by pemex
the in a presidential election set for july has promised to scrutinize the nation s energy reforms
but some industry leaders believe the country will stay on the path of opening everything from exploration to refining and gasoline retailing
there is a very clear strategy said jeremy weir chief executive of trading firm trafigura
broad participation by european and asian firms in several auctions is another a sign a mexican revival is underway added fatih birol president of the international energy agency a group representing most of the world s top oil consuming nations
some of mexico s and brazil s efforts are being copied
argentina is allowing oil companies to recommend specific areas for they would like to see auctioned as mexico did in past rounds colombia will open a permanent offer of areas as brazil plans to do and mexico plans to replicate brazil s auction calendar giving firms more time to plan capital spending before bidding rounds
some countries are keenly aware of the need to adjust its policies to compete with other nations according to juan carlos zepeda head of the nation s energy regulator national hydrocarbons commission cnh
we are flexible enough to accommodate any of our neighbors creativity he said
higher risk higher reward compared with brazil and mexico argentina and uruguay this year hope to catch investors with offers that hold greater exploration risk but potentially higher rewards
argentina officials believe brazil s formation could extend to areas off its atlantic coast and in july will release terms of its first offshore auction
that is a big change in a nation that just six year ago expropriated spanish oil firm repsol s stake in ypf
unlike the rounds for argentina s vast vaca muerta shale formation which were led locally by provincial governments the nation s central government will run this year s auctions standardizing rules and offering better terms
uruguay which holds a third offshore auction in april is putting up blocks for exploration and production after relaxing the qualification terms and reducing the scope of its mandatory exploration programs
smaller latin american countries including guyana suriname and paraguay are in talks with oil companies to offer rights to oilfields or to find partners for their oil firms
similar energy market openings have blossomed in the past only to fade as governments reverted to resource nationalization or imposed limits to foreign investment
latin america has in prior decades between opening to private investment and returning to oil nationalism
it s part of the cycle the countries tend to ask oil companies for as much as they can said horacio cuenca wood mackenzie s director of upstream research for latin america
they only lower costs and royalties when available capital starts drying reporting by marianna parraga additional reporting by ernest scheyder editing by gary mcwilliams and brian thevenot
