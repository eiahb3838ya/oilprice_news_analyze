naphtha premiums in south korea taiwan and malaysia have been rising since early march with levels last week reaching over a tonne the highest since december

as for cargoes about million tonnes were estimated to have arrived in march from western suppliers including in europe and the mediterranean with april arrivals expected at million tonnes traders said
that is down from nearly million tonnes in january and million tonnes in february
but the trend may not last beyond may
constraints on naphtha supply should ease as we move past maintenance season said

asia will need about million tonnes of naphtha from the west in may but this will drop to tonnes in june said a trader who tracks naphtha and lpg
the naphtha market is at its peak now
the second half of this year will be tough he said
