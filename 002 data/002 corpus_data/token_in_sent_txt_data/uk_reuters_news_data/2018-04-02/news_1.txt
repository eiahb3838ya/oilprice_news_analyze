update 4-u.s. epa to relax fuel efficiency standards for autos
washington reuters the trump administration on monday rejected an plan to make automobiles more fuel efficient opening up a long process to weaken current standards and putting california and the federal government on a collision course over vehicle emissions
scott pruitt administrator of the environmental protection agency said in a statement that the standards on model year to vehicles were not appropriate and should be revised
the obama administration set the average fuel efficiency standards too high and made assumptions about the standards that didn t comport with reality pruitt said
he did not offer specifics on revising them
the standards called for roughly doubling by the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the united states to about miles km per gallon
proponents said they could help spur innovation in clean technologies
california has long been allowed by an epa waiver to impose stricter standards than washington does on vehicle emissions of some pollutants
and other states including new york pennsylvania and massachusetts follow california s lead on cleaner cars
that has set up a battle on vehicle efficiency between california the most populous state and a massive car market and the administration of president donald trump
pruitt is a big proponent of states rights to regulate themselves but opposes california s push for greener cars
california s waiver to impose its own efficiency standards is being the epa said
it is in america s best interest to have a national standard pruitt said in the release
california governor jerry brown blasted the epa s action
this cynical and meretricious abuse of power will poison our air and jeopardize the health of all americans brown said
mary nichols the head of the california air resources board said her state will vigorously defend the existing clean vehicle auto industry executives have not publicly sought specific reductions in the requirements negotiated with the obama administration in as part of a bailout deal
but they have urged pruitt and trump to revise the obama standards so it becomes easier and less costly to meet complex targets which vary depending on the size of vehicles and whether they are classified as cars or trucks
automakers also want to avoid a patchwork of rules that would add costs to engine manufacturing
the best way to achieve our collective goals is under a single national program that provides an aggressive but achievable pathway a variety of compliance tools and factors in the role of customers said john bozzella president and chief executive officer of the association of global automakers
gloria bergquist a spokeswoman for the alliance of automobile manufacturers said pruitt made the right decision and that the administration was working on a way to both increase fuel economy and keep new vehicles affordable to more changes to the standards could affect car manufacturers including ford motor co general motors co and tesla inc auto suppliers were cautiously optimistic about the creation of a national fuel efficiency plan
steve handschuh head of the motor and equipment manufacturers association said while his group supports adjustments and flexibilities we do not support significant changes to the environmentalists decried pruitt s decision saying stricter standards would slash emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide
proponents of the corporate average fuel economy standards or cafe say they have led to big gains in auto technology and that relaxing them could eventually hurt sales of cars in european and asian countries that are moving toward mandates for electric cars
it would take america backward by jeopardizing successful safeguards that are working to clean our air save drivers money at the pump and drive technological innovation that creates jobs said luke tonachel a clean vehicles advocate at the natural resources defense council
