alaska officials still bullish on china nat gas partnership
anchorage alaska july reuters alaska officials on wednesday said they remain confident that china will help the state achieve its dream of building a pipeline to carry natural gas from the north slope to markets despite growing trade tensions
china is expected to buy about percent of the liquefied natural gas shipped through the pipeline so any tariffs that result from trade disputes could cause problems alaska gasline development corp vice president lieza wilcox said at a legislative hearing in anchorage on wednesday
that said this project is very well regarded in the government circles of both countries in the trade circles of both countries wilcox told lawmakers
the billion project would send natural gas from the north slope by pipeline to a liquefaction plant at cook inlet in southern alaska
from there the gas would be shipped overseas by tanker vessel
the field is expected to produce about billion cubic feet per day
the proposed pipeline has been touted frequently by trump administration members as important to its goal of exporting more energy
however a series of tariffs levied by the united states and china and subsequent additional threats have raised concerns on both sides of the pacific that the project could be a victim of increased tensions
in june china warned that it could impose tariffs on energy exports but that list did not include liquefied natural gas lng
since the united states started exporting lng from louisiana in february china has been the third biggest buyer of the fuel behind mexico and south korea
chinese firms bought about billion cubic feet of gas or percent of the lng the united states shipped between february and april according to federal energy data
one billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about five million homes for a day
agdc and other state agencies say the project is on track having secured agreements with institutions in china for help in developing and financing the project
it is frequently seen as kind of an olive branch in the trade discussions
and that s part of the reason why we re progressing the agreements on a fairly quick pace wilcox said
for nearly half a century alaskans pushed for a pipeline to carry gas to markets
but the project has been considered uneconomic because of geographic isolation competition and high cost
