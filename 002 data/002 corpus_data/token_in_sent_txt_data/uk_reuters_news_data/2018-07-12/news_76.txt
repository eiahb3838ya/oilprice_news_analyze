booming lng market steps out of the dark as transparency push grows
opaque lng pricing seen as hurdle to market entry platts glx platform see first transparent lng trades but majority of lng in asia still on contracts by jessica jaganathan singapore july reuters long dominated by deals struck in secret the billion liquefied natural gas industry is slowly seeing light as global traders push for more transparency in the booming market
over the past two months commodity price agency s p global platts and lng trading marketplace global lng exchange glx facilitated the first transparent physical trades in their platforms
it was the first time in nearly a decade since platts kicked off its asian lng derivative price assessment that it disclosed trading parties of a physical trade on its platform
pricing transparency is critical to boost liquidity in commodity markets but is often tough to do particularly in cash contracts with participants wary about exposing trading positions
lng producers also prefer fixed contracts because they provide steady revenues needed to fund dollar projects
but the lng trading landscape is slowly changing as more market participants push for transparency and japan s jera the world s biggest lng buyer and leading merchants like vitol expand their trading desks
these first few transparent bids or offers are the first steps to encourage greater market participation in using the platts marker to price cargoes said edmund siau analyst with energy consultancy fge
platts started publishing a daily asian lng price assessment in
but it was only in that volumes picked up then more than tripled in
volumes in this year have already surpassed last year s according to platts data
and for the first time platts last week published the counterparties of one lng trade for its pricing process three weeks after receiving its first transparent bid from commodity trader trafigura
we have seen a significant number of market participants that have stated they would like to see a more transparent price process said jonty rushforth senior director of energy pricing at platts
platts has approved six other entities in the transparent bidding process including britain s bp japan s itochu swiss vitol singapore s pavilion gas and diamond gas international a subsidiary of japan s mitsubishi global lng exchange glx an online platform for physical cargoes launched in april saw its first trade done in may this year as its members more than doubled to from last december most of them from asia which imports over percent of the world s lng
glx chief executive damien criddle said the platform has received four tenders since its launch
petronas lng a subsidiary of malaysia s petronas and a major producer of the fuel completed the first glx deal in late may
traders spend a lot of time talking on a bilateral basis with other traders to see whether they can sell spot cargoes ahmad adly alias vice president of petronas lng marketing and trading division said at a conference in late may adding that a platform like glx was a more effective way for price discovery
on tuesday cme group inc said it will develop the first physically deliverable lng futures contract on its new york mercantile exchange
still lng has a long way to go before reaching the level of liquidity and transparency in oil by far the world s most traded commodity but which only came after many years
steelmaking raw material iron ore only shifted to transparent spot pricing after four decades of contracts
majority of lng in asia remains under opaque contracts linked to the price of oil as producers opt for steady revenues to fund lng export projects some of which have cost billion to develop said fge s siau
until providers of project debt and equity are comfortable with the risks and rewards of using a spot lng index we expect the proportion of spot lng available will be limited he said
