trump brings reality-show style to nato, and leaves satisfied
brussels reuters he came
he raged
he claimed victory
he left
president donald trump brought his chaotic style of governing to the nato summit in brussels on wednesday and thursday irritating and befuddling allies with charges and jibes before declaring success for convincing his counterparts to pay more for their mutual defence
it was a classic performance for the reality television star whose america first mantra has translated into a style on the world stage particularly with countries traditionally considered to be friends
even before the nato summit was underway he kicked off the summit with a broadside against germany over plans for a natural gas pipeline with russia and he stepped up his criticism of the alliance as a whole for not taking more of the financial burden off the united states
he reinforced that tension through critical tweets even as he held polite talks with german chancellor angela merkel on the sidelines of the summit and made nice with other world leaders at a reception on wednesday night
he was in a good mood he said europe was a continent he appreciated luxembourg s prime minister xavier bettel said of trump at the evening event at which leaders enjoyed an acrobatic display and saxophone music in a brussels park
but the next morning the bad guy persona was back prompting the first formal nato crisis meeting since in which trump aired his grievances in a unscripted session over the funding issue again diplomats said
one diplomat said something appeared to have irritated trump a suggestion from another leader or possibly a report in the news media that he had not gotten his way
when he took the floor in the north atlantic council room for a session with members georgia and ukraine trump began a tirade which several diplomats said became a rage
he made very clear attacks against germany and warned that if nato countries did not meet a goal of raising their defence spending to two percent of their national gdp by january the united states would go it alone
that outburst prompted nato jens stoltenberg to ask ukraine and georgia to leave the room and in a closed session to try to get the summit back on track
trump continued his now familiar verbal attacks saying too many presidents had failed to get europeans to spend more on defence and that he wanted immediate results
but french president emmanuel macron with whom trump is friendly fought back and said the allies had to stick to the target for their defence spending increases
he could not change france s budget for next year which he had just presented to parliament
merkel said it was completely impossible to meet the commitments by january in the crisis session that trump himself later publicly described as tough for a while
it wasn t easy for merkel and the germans to be treated as a villain said a nato diplomat adding that the overall mood within the organisation was that this was the new by the end of that meeting despite the pushback trump felt victorious
during a news conference at nato headquarters the president declared that all was well and he believed in nato
he said he was proud that his intervention had prodded other nations to step up their spending
and with his opinions on britain s exit from the european union at that news conference trump even forced british prime minister theresa may into a public defence of her policies and to come out to speak to reporters diplomats said
we ve had a very amazing period in brussels trump told reporters
everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment
they re going to up it at levels that they ve never thought of in fact allies had agreed to stick to the goals that had already been set before trump became president and which nato officials say have much more to do with fear of russia than of the president
but trump was satisfied at least for the time being
and now we re very happy and have a very very powerful very very strong nato much stronger than it was two days ago he said
