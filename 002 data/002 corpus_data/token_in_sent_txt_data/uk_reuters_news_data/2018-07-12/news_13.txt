update 2-kremlin accuses trump of trying to bully europe into buying u.s. lng
trump doesn t like planned pipeline to germany has criticised german energy reliance on russia kremlin says trump trying to push lng on europe adds comments by secretary of energy perry by andrew osborn moscow july reuters the kremlin on thursday rejected president donald trump s description of germany as a captive of russia due to its energy reliance saying his statement was part of a campaign to bully europe into buying american energy supplies
trump told germany at a nato summit in brussels on wednesday that it was wrong to support an baltic sea pipeline to import even more russian gas while being slow to meet nato targets for defence spending
trump s comments came ahead of his summit on monday with russian president vladimir putin in helsinki though the kremlin said they were unlikely to have an impact on what was always going to be a difficult meeting due to the number of disagreements between the two countries
russia is keen to press ahead with the nord stream pipeline since it has the potential to double its gas exports under the baltic sea to germany bypassing traditional routes through ukraine with which it has poor relations
however washington opposes the project and a spokesman for the state department told reuters on wednesday that western firms invested in the pipeline were at risk of sanctions
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said trump s statement marked an escalation of a campaign to talk down russian gas supplies to europe in an attempt to push the energy sector instead
as for germany s dependence on russia as a major gas buyer we can not agree with this premise peskov told reporters on a conference call
supplies of pipeline gas do not lead to dependence of one country on another but to complete mutual dependence
that is a guarantee of stability and future peskov said moscow regarded objections to the new pipeline as unfair competition aimed at trying to force european countries to buy costlier liquefied natural gas
we consider that it s a question of economic competition and that the buyers must take their own decision he said
speaking in brussels secretary of energy rick perry said he had not heard any of his eu counterparts talk positively about nord stream and said washington didn t like it because it didn t promote diversity of supply
the president is pretty straightforward about what he believes and he thinks nord stream is not in the european union s best interest and my bet is he ll be more than happy to tell president putin that straight to his face said perry
five western firms have invested in nord stream wintershall and uniper of germany austria s omv shell and france s engie
