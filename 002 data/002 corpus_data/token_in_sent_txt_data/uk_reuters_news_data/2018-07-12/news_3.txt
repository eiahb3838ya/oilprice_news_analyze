u.s. sets gulf of mexico oil, gas lease sale despite lackluster demand
washington reuters the department of the interior said on thursday it would hold a auction for oil and gas leases in the gulf of mexico next month in an attempt to spark interest in offshore drilling months after a similar sale received a weak response from energy companies
the sale to be held on includes all available unleased areas in federal waters of the gulf of mexico in about million acres million hectares off texas louisiana mississippi alabama and florida
it is the third sale in the agency s program which aims to hold sales in all
the sale is part of what the interior department calls president donald trump s offshore energy strategy
vincent devito an adviser to interior secretary ryan zinke said the sale is just one piece of the administration s comprehensive effort to secure our nation s energy the last gulf of mexico lease sale held in march brought in only million as just percent of the million acres million hectares offered found bidders
in addition nearly all the purchases showed big drillers stuck closest to existing operations
in april zinke who had earlier proposed opening up nearly all the country s coasts to drilling said the sale in march held modest to little interest from drillers and added there was little likelihood for strong demand elsewhere in the country
his plan to open up the pacific and atlantic coasts was criticized by environmentalists politicians and tourism and fishing interests
the government estimates the outer continental shelf in the gulf of mexico contains about billion barrels of undiscovered technically recoverable oil and trillion cubic feet of undiscovered technically recoverable gas
most of the recent oil boom has occurred onshore where it is cheaper to drill than in deepwater
in addition many drillers are exploring in other places such as mexico where energy reforms have brought in billions of dollars in investments
