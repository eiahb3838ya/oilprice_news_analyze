update 3-beef, eggs, animal feed fatten cargill's profits
chicago reuters strong global demand for beef and animal feed fattened grain trader cargill inc s profits in fiscal year which were also boosted by trade tensions and south american weather woes the company said on thursday
for the full year adjusted operating earnings reached billion up percent from fiscal
company officials said that was the highest ever excluding earnings from cargill s investment in fertilizer producer the mosaic company which it exited in fiscal
the impact of a drought in argentina and volatility in financial and commodity markets sparked by trade disputes between the united states and top commerce partners china and mexico helped cargill s grain trading unit to its strongest showing in seven years
years of global oversupply have depressed grains prices and made it difficult for top agricultural grains merchants such as cargill to turn a profit buying and selling food staples such as corn soybeans and wheat
but the drought in argentina has eaten into the supply glut while tariffs have disrupted global grain flows giving merchants space to profit
cargill s chief financial officer marcel smits warned that too much volatility could be a problem however
the company has mapped out plans internally to deal with disruptions to trade smits said in an interview thursday
but the plans could quickly lose relevance given the speed at which the trade disputes are developing
we have potentially an advantage in terms of anticipating different scenarios but it is hard to risk manage yourself through some of that volatility smits said
over the past fiscal year the demand for protein and animal feed was the biggest boost to cargill s bottom line
beef packer margins have hit historic highs due to low cattle prices and strong retailer appetite heading into america s summer grilling season
global demand for all proteins whether from meat and poultry or aquaculture and plants is booming in emerging markets in asia and africa in part due to rising incomes industry analysts say
cargill has steadily expanded its portfolio in the sector in recent years from investing in pea protein production to buying pollos el bucanero sa one of colombia s largest meat producers
in its traditional crop businesses cargill s soy crush margins have improved worldwide smits said
cargill s net earnings rose to million in the fourth quarter ended may from million a year earlier
