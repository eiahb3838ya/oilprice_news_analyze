australia bans foreigners from parliament internships after unease about china
sydney reuters foreigners have been banned from working as interns for australian members of parliament a spokesman for the senate said on thursday in a reform apparently aimed at blocking chinese prying into australian affairs
the programme placing young people in a position working for a federal legislator for a stint had been open to all nationalities as long as the applicant did not have a criminal record
internships at parliament house are restricted to australian citizens said a spokesman for senator scott ryan president of the senate which oversaw the change
the spokesman declined to comment on what prompted the alteration or if it was made to block chinese interference
late last year prime minister malcolm turnbull accused china of meddling in domestic affairs
china denied the accusation which led to a strain in ties between the important trading partners
the financial times newspaper reported in september that a new zealand citizen who had previously interned at an australian parliamentary committee had links to a chinese military spy school
that report prompted a review of the intern system which concluded standards should be bought in line with the rest of the government
chinese students had often applied to the programme and many worked as interns over the years
a spokeswoman for the australian national university anu which provides many of the interns said it had been informed of the change in the eligibility rule late last year
the change was only publicly disclosed some months later when the anu amended the rules it posted on its website
last month australia passed legislation designed to prevent interference by foreign governments a reform turnbull said was needed to combat chinese meddling
under the law lobbyists for foreign countries will be required to register and they will be liable to criminal prosecution if they are deemed to be interfering in domestic affairs
