german business group enraged by trump attacks on nord stream pipeline
berlin reuters german companies active in eastern european business on thursday dismissed president donald trump s criticism of the nord stream gas pipeline plan a day after he called berlin a captive to the state department overnight repeated a warning to western firms involved in the deal for the pipeline from russia under the baltic sea saying the project could divide europe and they were at risk of sanctions
threats of sanctions against european companies invested in nord stream encroach on european energy policy the chairman of the german committee on eastern european economic relations ostausschuss wolfgang buechele told reuters
he said that trump s remarks and sanctions against russia that also target foreign companies there were an assault on business relations between german and european countries and russia
the project led by gazprom aims to double capacity of the existing nord stream pipeline from next year bypassing traditional routes through ukraine
germany s uniper and wintershall are among western partners that also include shell france s engie and austria s omv
the german committee groups members active in countries in eastern europe accounting for about a fifth of germany s total foreign trade which is more sizeable than bilateral trades germany conducts with the and china individually
buechele said it was not up to washington to identify which countries german companies were allowed to trade with
the energy partnership with russia had stretched over decades with mutual benefits and gas imports from russia were a competitively priced and reliable energy source for private consumers and industry he said
chancellor angela merkel insists the project is a private commercial venture
buechele also said that to claim russia would be able to control gas markets was factually wrong and politically a spokesman for uniper declined comment on the latest exchanges but offered a wider statement by chief executive klaus schaefer saying that he wished for a of the sanctions spiral
we are holding on to our contractual obligations regarding nord stream of whose value for germany and europe we are convinced given the background of declining gas production in europe schaefer said
this is a project for coming decades and thus partially independent of reporting by gernot heller additional reporting by tom kaeckenhoff writing by vera eckert editing by william maclean
