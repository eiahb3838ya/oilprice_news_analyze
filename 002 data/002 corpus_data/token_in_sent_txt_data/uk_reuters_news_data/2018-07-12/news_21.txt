the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london july reuters brent crude prices registered their largest fall in more than two years on wednesday in what was probably an indication hedge fund managers and other traders are realising profits after a rally
futures slumped by per barrel or just under percent a daily price move more than three standard deviations away from the mean and the largest decline since february
the market has suffered a larger percentage decline on only days since the start of and it comes after a long period in which price volatility has been very low by historical standards
traders and analysts have blamed the sudden drop on a cocktail of factors including the reopening of oil export terminals in libya and the worsening trade dispute between the united states and china
there have also been hints the united states will grant at least some waivers for countries to continue importing iranian crude easing fears of an extreme supply crunch after sanctions are reimposed in november
saudi arabia also sharply increased exports in june and is expected to raise them further in july helping relieve fears about future shortages
the most likely explanation is a combination of all these factors coupled with stretched market positioning and a lack of liquidity
brent has shown signs of topping out for some time even as prices remain close to their highest since
buoyant flat prices have concealed signs of weakness elsewhere in the calendar spreads as well as hedge fund positioning
brent spreads which cycle between contango and backwardation as the oil market alternates between and have been softening for more than a month
the futures spread peaked in a backwardation of per barrel in late april and had slipped to just on tuesday before plunging to cents on wednesday
hedge funds and other money managers have cut their bullish position in brent futures and options from million barrels in early april to just million barrels by july
portfolio managers hold just over eight bullish long positions in brent for every bearish short position but the ratio has come down from in april

overall the fund community remains bullish on oil anticipating that strong consumption growth and further disruptions in production will tighten the market even further in and
but they are less bullish following the percent in brent prices over the last months and the market s failure to break through the previous highs set in may
fears about future supply disruptions have failed to push prices higher and cast doubt on the potential for further gains
the resulting has gradually sapped the momentum from the rally and probably contributed to the lack of liquidity behind wednesday s price move
the sharpest price drops were concentrated in futures contracts which are where many hedge fund positions are held
even after in recent weeks fund managers still held a historically high and lopsided bullish position in brent futures leaving them vulnerable to another bout of
crude futures prices have remained supported by the interruption of pipeline deliveries into the midwest as a result of the shutdown at canada s syncrude plant
hedge funds have actually been buying crude futures adding million barrels of net bullish positions in the last two weeks even as they left brent positions unchanged
but brent has had no such local factors to support the market and on wednesday it finally seemed to succumb to a plunge
markets exhibit strong cyclical behaviour
once prices stop rising they tend to fall rather than hold at the peak
and the sharpest price falls in a market come not straight after the peak but normally when prices have been under gentle pressure for some time and the initial trickle of selling finally turns into a torrent
that is likely what happened on wednesday
