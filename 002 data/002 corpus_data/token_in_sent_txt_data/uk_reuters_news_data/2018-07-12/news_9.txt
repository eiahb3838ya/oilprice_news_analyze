u.s. tries to rally votes for a u.n. arms embargo on south sudan
united nations july reuters the united states is trying to rally enough votes at the united nations security council to impose an arms embargo on south sudan following continued fighting and human rights abuses diplomats said on thursday
a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by russia china britain france or the united states
the council could vote as early as friday
diplomats said washington has secured at least seven votes but some council members say the timing is not right given attempts to revitalize the peace process
the mission to the united nations was not immediately available to comment
south sudan which split off from its northern neighbor sudan in has been gripped by a civil war since caused by political rivalry between president salva kiir and his former deputy riek machar
last friday the government and opposition signed an agreement on security arrangements which follow on from a ceasefire deal last month
however on thursday south sudan s parliament voted to extend kiir s mandate until in a move likely to undermine the peace talks as opposition groups have said the change would be illegal
at the end of may the security council renewed its targeted sanctions regime on south sudan until july and said it would consider an arms embargo and blacklisting six senior south sudan officials if chief antonio guterres reported by june that there was still conflict or a lack of a viable political agreement
that resolution was adopted with nine votes in favor and six abstentions
there have been credible reports of fighting guterres told the security council in a june letter
he also said peacekeepers had documented gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law
while the outcome of regional and international efforts to deliver a political settlement of the conflict is yet unclear i must reiterate that any revitalized agreement must be inclusive fair and sustainable guterres wrote
the human rights office said on tuesday that at least civilians were killed and women and girls raped in scorched earth attacks by south sudan government troops and aligned forces in villages earlier this year
