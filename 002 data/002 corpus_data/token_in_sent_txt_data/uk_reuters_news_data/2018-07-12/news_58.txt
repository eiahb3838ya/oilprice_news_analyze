update 2-japan faces "frequent" disasters as flood toll reaches 200
kurashiki japan reuters japan risks more severe weather and must find ways to alleviate disasters a government spokesman said on thursday as intense heat and water shortages raised fear of disease among survivors of last week s floods and landslides
torrential rain in western japan caused the country s worst weather disaster in years killing people many in communities that have existed for decades on mountain slopes and flood plains largely untroubled by storms
but severe weather has been battering the country more regularly in recent years raising questions about the impact of global warming
dozens of people were killed in a similar disaster last year
it s an undeniable fact that this sort of disaster due to torrential unprecedented rain is becoming more frequent in recent years chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told a news conference in tokyo
saving lives was the government s biggest duty he said
we recognise that there s a need to look into steps we can take to reduce the damage from disasters like this even a little bit he said
he did not elaborate on what steps the government could take
more than households had no water a week after disaster struck and many thousands of people were homeless
with temperatures ranging from to celsius to fahrenheit and high humidity life in school gymnasiums and other evacuation centres where families spread out on mats on the floors began to take a toll
television footage showed one elderly woman trying to sleep by kneeling across a folding chair arms over her eyes to keep out the light
with few portable fans in evacuation centres many survivors waved paper fans to keep cool
tight water supplies meant that people were not getting enough fluids authorities said
without water we can t really clean anything up
we can t wash anything one man told nhk television
the government has sent out water trucks but supplies remain limited
in the mabi district of kurashiki city in okayama prefecture piles of refrigerators washing machines and furniture lined the streets as residents used hoses to wash mud out of their homes
unable to join in the strenuous work hisako takeuchi and her husband spent the past five nights at an elementary school that had been turned into a evacuation centre
we only have each other and no relatives nearby
we aren t able to move large things and we desperately need volunteer helpers said takeuchi
prime minister shinzo abe on a visit to kurashiki on thursday promised to provide help as soon as possible
he is set to visit two other areas on friday and the weekend
more than military police and firefighters toiled through the debris in a search for bodies
teams used diggers and chainsaws to clear landslides and cut away wreckage of buildings and trees
many areas were buried deep in mud that smelled like sewage and had hardened in the heat
