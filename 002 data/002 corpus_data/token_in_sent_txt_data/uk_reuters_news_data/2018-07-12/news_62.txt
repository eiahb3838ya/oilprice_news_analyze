world's oil cushion could be stretched to the limit, iea warns
iea says supply vulnerability to underpin prices outages in libya venezuela canada tighten oil supplies iranian exports could drop by over mln bpd iea holds oil demand growth forecast at mln bpd by ron bousso london july reuters the world s oil supply cushion could be stretched to the limit due to prolonged outages supporting prices and threatening demand growth the international energy agency said on thursday
the expected drop in iranian crude exports this year due to renewed sanctions coupled with a decline in venezuela s production and outages in libya canada and the north sea have driven oil prices to their highest since in recent weeks
opec and other key producers including russia responded to the tightness by easing a agreement with saudi arabia vowing to support the market as president donald trump accused the group of pushing prices higher
the iea said in its monthly oil markets report that there were already very welcome signs that output from leading producers had been boosted and may reach a record
the global energy watchdog however said the disruptions underscored the pressure on global supplies as the world s spare production capacity cushion might be stretched to the limit
spare capacity refers to a producer s ability to ramp up production in a relatively short time
much of it is located in the middle east
the iea said opec crude production in june reached a high of million barrels per day
spare capacity in the middle east in july was million bpd roughly percent of global output
production including from surging shale also continued to rise but the iea said that might not be enough to assuage concerns
this vulnerability currently underpins oil prices and seems likely to continue doing so
we see no sign of higher production from elsewhere that might ease fears of market tightness it said
the iea maintained its oil demand growth forecast at million bpd but warned that higher prices could dampen consumption
higher prices are prolonging the fears of consumers everywhere that their economies will be damaged
in turn this could have a marked impact on oil demand china and india the world s second and third largest oil consumers could face major challenges in finding alternative crude oil following the drop in iranian and venezuelan exports the iea said
