update 1-u.s.'s pompeo urges allies to cut off funding to iran
brussels reuters secretary of state mike pompeo called on american allies on thursday to help impose economic pressure on iran and accused tehran of continuing to sell weapons in the middle east despite united nations resolutions
we must cut off all funding the regime uses to fund terrorism proxy wars pompeo said in a twitter post ahead of a scheduled meeting with the european union s foreign affairs and security policy representative federica mogherini in brussels
in may the united states pulled out of a multinational deal that lifted many sanctions against iran in return for curbs to its nuclear program
washington has since told countries they must halt all imports of iranian oil from or face financial measures with no exemptions
since president donald trump s decision to withdraw from the agreement european states have been scrambling to ensure iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to maintain the nuclear curbs required in the deal
but so far it has proven difficult to offset the impact of sanctions with european firms reluctant to risk financial penalties to do business in iran
pompeo who has been attending a nato summit in brussels flew in from abu dhabi where he discussed iran with leaders of the united arab emirates
earlier on thursday trump was asked at a nato news conference about rising tensions with iran and replied i would say there might be an escalation between us and the however iran was now treating us with much more respect right now than they did in the past trump added
i know they re having a lot of problems and their economy is collapsing but i will tell you this at a certain point they re going to call me and they re going to say let s make a deal
and we ll make a deal
but they re feeling a lot of pain right now trump said
senior state department officials have also completed three days of talks on iran in saudi arabia and discussed new ways to deprive the regime of revenues a state department official told reporters traveling on pompeo s plane
in saudi arabia the officials discussed oil sanctions to deny iran revenue maintaining a oil market to guard against volatility and helping partners find alternatives to iran oil the official said
in another tweet pompeo said that on thursday together with allies from britain france germany saudi arabia and jordan we reaffirmed our support for the syrian political process and our goals of removing iran s influence defeating isis deterring chemical weapons pompeo said iran continued to send weapons across the middle east in blatant violation of un security council iran s regime wants to start trouble wherever it can
it s our responsibility to stop it he said
