nigeria's amputee football team prepares for world cup debut
lagos reuters sixteen years after emmanuel ibeawuchi lost a leg in a road accident his dream of playing soccer in a world cup is about to become a reality
he will captain nigeria s team when it makes its debut at the amputee football world cup in mexico in october
the team hopes to follow in the footsteps of nigeria s disabled athletes who won eight gold medals at the paralympics along with two silver and two bronze medals to finish in the medal table and top among african countries
we are the best all over the world so whatever we do we excel said ibeawuchi a bus conductor citing the success of nigerian disabled athletes across a range of sports
there is no difference between one leg and two legs in terms of football because it is the same rules added the who has played the game since his lower right leg was amputated a few inches below his knee
the amputee tournament will take place just months after the world cup in russia where nigeria s team known as the super eagles failed to qualify from the group stage
the squad has been training in the commercial capital of lagos using crutches during games set on dusty brown soil
like many cities across africa there are few facilities in public spaces for disabled people in lagos a city of around million people
team coach victor nwewe said this makes disabled athletes less visible a factor that affects the confidence of some players
we have put it in them that they should see themselves as equally good as an able person he said arguing that his team known as the special eagles can outperform their counterpart s appearance at the world cup in russia
since then all of them have the confidence now that they can even do better than the able bodied he said
