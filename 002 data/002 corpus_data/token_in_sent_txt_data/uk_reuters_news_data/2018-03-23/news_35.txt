new chinese vp makes low key debut with philippines meeting
beijing march reuters china s new vice president a close ally of president xi jinping on friday made his first appearance on the political scene since taking up the job a week ago in a relatively meeting with the philippines top diplomat
vice president wang qishan china s former chief is expected to have dealing with the trump administration as a major focus of his portfolio as ties with washington nosedive diplomatic sources say
president donald trump s plans for tariffs on up to billion in chinese goods have brought the world s two largest economies closer to a trade war
but wang s first task was the philippines
meeting philippine foreign affairs secretary alan peter cayetano at the zhongnanhai central leadership compound in beijing wang said the philippines was a traditionally friendly neighbour of china s state media said
in the new year both countries should continue to meet each other halfway deepen cooperation and handle disputes appropriately wang added
cayetano has been in china to discuss possible joint oil and gas exploration in the disputed south china sea
china claims most of the south china sea a key trade route and home to areas that are believed to hold large quantities of oil and natural gas
along with china parts of the south china sea are subject to competing claims from brunei malaysia taiwan vietnam and the philippines
the philippines ties with china have warmed under president rodrigo duterte who has put aside territorial disputes in exchange for trade opportunities and pledged financing for infrastructure projects
duterte is visiting china next month to attend the boao economic forum on the southern island province of hainan and will meet xi
whether xi could retain wang in a senior role despite his reaching retirement age had been seen as a key measure of xi s power and the subject of intense interest in the to this month s parliament which approved his new role last weekend
in january wang who turns in july was named a parliament delegate with the central province of hunan despite having stepped down from the elite politburo standing committee during a leadership transition in october
