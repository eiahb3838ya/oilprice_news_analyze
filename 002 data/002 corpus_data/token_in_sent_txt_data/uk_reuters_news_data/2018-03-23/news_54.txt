mexican president defends energy reform from leftist's attacks
mexico city reuters mexico s president on thursday defended his decision to open the energy sector against attacks from the man currently favourite to succeed him saying a rollback of the measure could cost the country billions of dollars in lost investment
the legislative overhaul that ended state oil firm pemex s monopoly was the centrepiece of president enrique pena nieto s economic agenda and leftist andres manuel lopez obrador who is leading polls for the july presidential election has threatened to unpick it
speaking in the state of veracruz pena nieto said those calling to walk back the reform risked condemning mexico to an obsolete economic model without naming lopez obrador
to cancel the energy reform is practically to make disappear the investments that today require certainty pena nieto said at the inauguration of a technology centre
we want the private sector to invest for it to generate returns for mexico and its people he added
pena nieto said over jobs and billion billion worth of investment ultimately depended on the energy reform s success
he is barred by law from seeking
lopez obrador has pledged to review the oil and gas contracts awarded under pena nieto s government if elected and on wednesday evening said his administration would consider unwinding the energy reform legislatively
pena nieto s reform changed the constitution to grant private operators oil and gas exploration and production rights in a bid to reverse years of declining crude output
however the reform coincided with a sharp decline in oil prices and the government has said it will take time for the of the energy sector to bear fruit
pledging to reduce mexico s dependence on policies sent from abroad lopez obrador has attacked pena nieto s economic agenda on the grounds that corruption is widespread
corruption scandals lacklustre growth and rising violence have battered the government s reputation
later on thursday energy minister pedro joaquin coldwell told local radio that to undo the energy reform would be extremely harmful and would make mexico more dependent on natural gas imports and deny it major tax revenues
joaquin coldwell noted the only body authorized to revoke oil and gas contracts provided serious violations are shown to have occurred is the industry regulator the national hydrocarbons commission not the president
