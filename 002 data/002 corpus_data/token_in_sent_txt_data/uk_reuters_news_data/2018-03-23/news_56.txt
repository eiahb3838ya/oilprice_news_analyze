update 1-boeing will not appeal trade case against bombardier - spokesman
montreal reuters boeing co will not appeal against the trade commission ruling that allows canada s bombardier inc to sell its newest jets to airlines without heavy duties a boeing spokesman said on thursday
the decision by boeing puts the trade challenge to rest
a canadian government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said boeing s decision was good news
the international trade commission itc unanimously voted in january to reject boeing s complaint and discarded a commerce department recommendation to slap a near percent duty on sales of the bombardier cseries jets for five years
the itc had widely been expected to side with boeing the world s largest maker of jetliners which accused bombardier of dumping the planes or selling them below cost in the market
however the itc said it rejected placing duties on bombardier jets partly because boeing had lost no sales or revenue when delta air lines inc ordered the aircraft in from the canadian planemaker
the itc ruled the cseries jets ordered by delta and boeing s smallest max plane do not compete
the smaller end of the jet market is an increasing focus for the major manufacturers
airbus se has agreed to take a majority stake in the cseries in a deal expected to close later this year while boeing is in talks with bombardier s brazilian rival embraer sa
the boeing spokesman declined to elaborate on the decision not to appeal
it was not yet clear how boeing s decision will impact the planemaker s relationship with the canadian government which is holding a competition for fighter jets worth between c billion and billion
a bombardier spokesman was not immediately available to comment
