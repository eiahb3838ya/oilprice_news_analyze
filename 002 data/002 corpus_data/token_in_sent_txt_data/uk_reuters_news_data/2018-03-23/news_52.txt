asian oil, gas producers stepping up activity after long lull
kuala lumpur reuters asia s oil and gas producers are starting to revive projects aimed at deflating years of ballooning energy imports after new investment dried up following the industry crisis
spending has so far been driven mainly by state oil companies such as india s ongc thailand s pttep and petrovietnam which need to produce more oil and gas to ensure their countries energy security executives said this week during an industry event in kuala lumpur malaysia
asia is by far the biggest consumer of oil yet its output is falling faster than in any other region
that mismatch more than doubled asia s oil import bill to around billion billion pounds last year compared with year levels
with oil prices back above per barrel and at times flirting with a barrel oilfield service providers say there is renewed appetite for producers to spend and importers to cut import bills by investing in production
asia is a net importer of energy
i think there s a strong desire from southeast asian organizations to change that trend
we ll see a lot more potential developments here to try to balance that equation said ian prescott vice president for asia with engineering company mcdermott
fifty oil and gas fields in southeast asia with a collective billion barrels of oil equivalent in resources will likely be approved for development between and according to consultancy rystad energy requiring some billion of capital expenditure from final investment decision fid to first production

in india changes to gas pricing policies revived activities in its eastern deepwater fields led by ongc and a joint venture between reliance industries and bp
india has waited too long to enter deepwater
deepwater development makes more sense for the country india than importing lng at per million british thermal units ashish bhandari a vice president at oil service company baker hughes said at the otc asia conference
in southeast asia petrovietnam is developing a large gas field known as block b while thailand s pttep is on the hunt for more gas supplies in the region to meet demand in thailand and myanmar
despite the uptick in activity exploration for new oil and gas remains lower in asia than elsewhere especially onshore north america and in the atlantic basin
kevin robinson vice president of malaysia s oil and gas service company sapura energy said the main factors deterring investment in asia were tough fiscal regimes cumbersome bureaucracies and maturing fields with limited future reserves
it s a reality check for governments in asia to look at how much investment they are getting and how they need to improve their fiscal terms to attract more investment robinson said
ongc s director of offshore rajesh kakkar said the easy oil is gone what is left is deepwater high pressure and high temperature making extraction more costly
but given competition from cheap producers in the middle east and soaring output from shale drillers in the united states petronas chief executive officer wan zulkiflee wan ariffin said there was pressure to keep costs low
while oil prices are showing signs of recovery the sustainability of these prices remains to be seen
if we don t keep these escalating costs in check the industry runs the risk of negating the value we have gained from intensive cost efficiency efforts over the last reporting by florence tan emily chow and ananthalakshmi editing by henning glostein and tom hogue
