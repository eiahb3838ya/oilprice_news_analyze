update 1-nature's 'alarming' decline threatens food, water, energy - un
oslo reuters human activities are causing an alarming decline in the variety of plant and animal life on earth and jeopardizing food clean water and energy supplies a study of biodiversity said on friday
climate change will become a steadily bigger threat to biodiversity by adding to damage from pollution and forest clearance to make way for agriculture according to more than experts in a set of reports approved by governments
biodiversity the essential variety of on earth continues to decline in every region of the world the authors wrote after talks in colombia
this alarming trend endangers the quality of life of people four regional reports covered the americas asia and the pacific africa europe and central asia all areas of the planet except the poles and the high seas
for the americas the report estimated that the value of nature to people such as crops wood water purification or tourism was at least trillion a year equivalent to the region s gross domestic product from alaska to argentina
almost of those natural contributions were in decline in the americas it said
robert watson chair of the intergovernmental platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes said biodiversity was not only about saving rare butterflies trees birds or rhinos
while that was important he told reuters a key message was please stop thinking of biodiversity just as an environmental issue
it s way more important than that
among other economic estimates the africa report said the absorption of greenhouse gases by a hectare acres of forest in central africa was worth a year
unless governments take strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions climate change may be the biggest threat to biodiversity by watson said
he said delegates had not challenged findings about climate change although president donald trump doubts mainstream scientific opinion and plans to pull out of the paris climate agreement
for pollution eight of rivers around the world with most plastic waste were in asia
on current trends overfishing meant there could be no exploitable fish stocks in the region by
around the world ever more animals and plants were under threat from human activities ranging from elephants in africa to rare mosses and snails in europe the study said
by climate change could result in the loss of more than half of african bird and mammal species said emma archer of south africa the of the african assessment
rising human populations in many developing nations would require new policies both to protect nature and to meet goals of eradicating poverty and hunger by
in europe and central asia wetlands have declined by half since threatening many species
amid the gloom there were some bright spots
forest cover had risen by percent in china and other nations in northeast asia between and
parks and other protected areas were expanding in many regions including the americas and
and populations of animals such as the iberian lynx amur tiger and far eastern leopard were coming back from the brink of extinction thanks to conservation
