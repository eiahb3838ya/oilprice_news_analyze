amnesty denounces western arms sales to saudi arabia and allies in yemen war
dubai reuters amnesty international on friday denounced western arms sales to saudi arabia and its allies in a coalition battling the houthis in yemen saying such traffic made a mockery of a global arms trade treaty
the rights group accused both the coalition forces and the houthis of committing potential war crimes in the conflict
more than people have been killed in yemen since march when saudi arabia and other sunni muslim arab states launched a military campaign against the houthis a group of shi ite fighters who had seized the capital and forced president abd rabbu mansour to flee
there is extensive evidence that irresponsible arms flows to the saudi coalition have resulted in enormous harm to yemeni civilians lynn maalouf director of research for the middle east at amnesty international said in a statement
but this has not deterred the usa the uk and other states including france spain and italy from continuing transfers of billions of dollars worth of such arms
as well as devastating civilian lives this makes a mockery of the global arms trade the organisation said it had documented coalition air strikes since that appeared to have violated international law adding that some may amount to war crimes
the documented attacks had killed civilians including at least children and wounded others according to amnesty
it said the houthis and their allies had conducted arbitrary arrests and detentions of opponents and that scores of men and women had been subjected to enforced disappearances and harsh sentences following unfair trails
saudi arabia and its allies have repeatedly denied allegations of war crimes and say their campaign is directed against houthi fighters and not civilians
the houthi movement has also denied accusations of war crimes
amnesty said that as the conflict enters its fourth year it shows no real signs of abating and that all sides were impeding the delivery of humanitarian aid to at least million people in need of assistance and more than one million suffering from suspected cases of cholera
the rights group said that despite the loosening of a blockade on yemeni ports imposed by the coalition it continues to impose restrictions on aid and commercial imports of essential goods
two rights groups in france said on friday they would take legal action against the french government unless it halts sales of weapons to saudi arabia and its ally the united arab emirates within two months
saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman discussed the yemen conflict with president donald trump this week during a visit to the united states
