update 2-britain blocks plans for new coal mine on climate grounds
london reuters britain has rejected plans for a new open cast coal mine in northeastern england as it could hamper efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb climate change the minister for local government said on friday

britain plans to coal use at its power stations by as a part of its efforts to meet its climate targets and is part of an international alliance pushing other countries to do the same

gavin styles managing director at the mine s developer banks mining said britain was still dependent on coal for a number of purposes and the decision had been taken for purely political the importance of securing investment in north east england creating dozens of high quality local jobs and opening up opportunities for regional suppliers to win substantial contracts could not be any clearer he said in an emailed statement
the company said the project could employ people and generate almost million pounds million in related contracts and other benefits to the community
styles said the company would carefully review the decision before deciding on the most appropriate next steps to take
environmentalists had criticized the plans saying it would destroy an area of natural beauty and that extracting more coal is at odds with international pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the paris climate pact
this is the first coal mine ever to be rejected in the uk because of climate change impacts a vindication for everyone who has been calling for fossil fuels to be left in the ground said rose dickinson campaigner with environmental group friends of the earth
