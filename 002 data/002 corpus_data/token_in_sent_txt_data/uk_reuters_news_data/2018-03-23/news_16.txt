analysis-race to rebuild european gas inventories supports british prices
plunging winter temperatures drove up demand uk gas prices soared to record levels in march refilling must start from april for winter needs by nina chestney and sabina zawadzki london march reuters benchmark british wholesale gas prices will stay elevated for the rest of as operators across europe race to replenish inventories that have plunged to their lowest in at least five years
prices soared to record highs in march as freezing temperatures lifted gas demand to its highest level since drawing down stocks across europe and exacerbating tightness from outages and reduced liquefied natural gas lng imports
britain whose gas prices are a benchmark for other european hubs relies on reserves to manage its winter demand
it will need to refill at record pace this summer at a time when european nations are also chasing extra supplies
adding to britain s headache what was its largest storage site rough has now closed removing an extra cushion to meet winter demand that once had capacity to inject gas into the national network for consecutive days if needed
northwest european gas storage volumes are expected to start the summer season at about billion cubic metres bcm the lowest level since at least when thomson reuters eikon data for european inventories began and stocks stood at bcm
that does not mean that gas prices will spike but it s unlikely that gas prices will drop at least for the very beginning of the season said giacomo masato research analyst at brokerage marex spectron
unseasonable cold weather in britain is expected to continue to the end of march pushing inventories lower still
british stocks now stand at million cubic metres compared to bcm at the same point a year ago
if we don t see injection in april the lag is going to be so acute going through summer it has to be a flashing risk for next winter thomson reuters gas analyst oliver sanderson said
the impact of acute storage depletion will be felt for some time to come
lower inventories in june and july could be bullish lifting the winter and august price
the european gas system is also acutely sensitive to unplanned outages he said
summer gas prices are now about pence per therm having risen about percent since early february while the winter contract is about per therm
investment bank goldman sachs has raised its forecasts for british gas
it sees second quarter prices at british thermal units mmbtu or pence per therm percent higher than its previous estimate
it sees prices up percent from its previous estimate at or per therm
bmi research sees prices averaging pence per therm up from a previous forecast of per therm
trevor sikorski analyst at consultancy energy aspects said europe now needed to find an extra bcm by october to replenish stocks
that will take quite a lot of additional lng and if not increased nomination from russia he said
last year monthly european union gas consumption was around bcm from april to the end of september according to the eu s statistics office eurostat
adding to upside pressure on prices russian gas giant gazprom might not be able to reroute sufficient flows to europe after it began unwinding its transit contract with ukraine analysts say
tension between moscow and london after the poisoning of a former double agent living in britain has also raised questions about british energy security
although russian gas accounts for less than percent of british demand britain relies heavily on supplies from the netherlands which may itself have to increase russian imports as the dutch government reduces output from a major gas field
the dutch government says it wants to cut production to bcm a year at its groningen field as quickly as possible from more than bcm now
the initiative aims to reduce the risk of tremors caused by the production process
britain could turn to its other main supplier norway but it will face competition for the gas from elsewhere in europe
the amount of lng britain receives over the summer is also uncertain as much depends on the development of asian spot lng premiums over european gas hubs
there are geopolitical issues storage is obviously a concern uncertainty around groningen a lack of lng although this might change and french nuclear is still a concern for me this winter said wayne bryan analyst at alfa energy
