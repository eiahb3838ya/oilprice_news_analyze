oil prices rise as saudi arabia says production curbs could last into 2019
oil shakes off looming trade brent to rise to by on strong demand morgan stanley by henning gloystein singapore march reuters oil prices rose on friday pushed up by saudi statements that opec and russian led production curbs that were introduced in will need to be extended into in order to tighten the market
the rise in oil prices defied global stock markets and other commodities which slumped on the back of worries about a trade between the united states and china
president donald trump signed a presidential memorandum on thursday that could impose tariffs on up to billion of imports from china while china unveiled plans on friday to impose tariffs on up to billion of imports
west texas intermediate wti crude futures were at a barrel at gmt up cents or percent from their previous close
brent crude futures were at per barrel up cents or percent
traders said the driver for crude futures was a statement by saudi arabian energy minister khalid who said on thursday that opec members will need to continue coordinating with russia and other countries on supply curbs in to reduce global oil inventories
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec of which saudi arabia is the leader as well as a group of countries led by russia struck a production supply agreement in january to remove million barrels per day bpd from global markets and end a supply glut
the pact is set to expire at the end of this year but saudi arabia now seems to be pushing for an extension
we know for sure that we still have some time to go before we bring inventories down to the level we consider normal and we will identify that by when we meet in vienna falih told reuters in an interview in washington
and then we will hopefully by identify the mechanism by which we will work in although analysts said the potential between the united states and china could also hit oil markets for now most said demand looked healthy
morgan stanley also cited a in seasonal demand in the coming month and geopolitical risk as potential supports for oil prices we are only weeks away from peak refinery maintenance after which crude and product demand should accelerate
global inventories are already at the bottom end of the range
with the inventory cushion largely gone oil prices will likely be more sensitive to geopolitical risk factors the bank said
there are sufficient reasons to expect oil prices to strengthen further from here and we stick with our brent per barrel call for morgan stanley said
