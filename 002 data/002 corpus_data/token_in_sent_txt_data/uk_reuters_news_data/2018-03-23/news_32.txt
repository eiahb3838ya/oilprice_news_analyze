refile-update 2-vietnam halts south china sea oil drilling project under pressure from beijing
reuters vietnam has halted an oil drilling project in the red emperor block off its southeastern coast licensed to spanish energy firm repsol following pressure from china three sources with direct knowledge of the situation told reuters on friday
it would be the second time in less than a year that vietnam has had to suspend a major oil development in the busy south china sea waterway under pressure from china
a source with direct knowledge of the situation said government ministries in vietnam had paused the project while the politburo debates whether to suspend or indefinitely terminate the contract
the decision which hangs on whether the fees incurred by contract cancellation will exceed the cost of resisting chinese pressure is on hold until the politburo meets the source said
that meeting has been delayed by overseas trips by vietnam s prime minister nguyen xuan phuc a series of visits by foreign dignitaries to hanoi and the death of former prime minister phan van khai on saturday
the ministries are determined to terminate the contract said the source who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation
a source with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed that the project which is a joint venture with state oil company petrovietnam had been stopped following pressure from china
a source at repsol told reuters executives had been discussing how to respond to the pressure which had been applied both directly by china and indirectly via vietnam
a spokesman for repsol in madrid declined to comment
petrovietnam executives declined to comment
the vietnamese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment
asked at a regular briefing if china had pressed either vietnam or repsol chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said she did not know where such news had come from but did not elaborate
we hope the relevant sides can work together to maintain the positive situation in the south china sea she said
red emperor known in vietnamese as the ca rong do field is part of block in the nam con son basin km miles off the coast of vietnam s southern city of vung tau
the field of moderate size by international standards is seen as a key asset to help slow the decline of vietnam s stalling oil and gas production
but the block lies near the line that marks the vast area that china claims in the sea and overlaps what it says are its own oil concessions
located in waters around metres ft deep it is considered to be profitable from around per barrel
current brent crude oil prices are almost per barrel
the field s estimated potential recovery is around million barrels of crude oil billion cubic feet of natural gas and million barrels of condensate a super light form of crude oil that is mostly a byproduct of gas production
global crude oil by comparison is at almost million barrels per day
global gas consumption is around trillion cubic metres per year
the move came as repsol was making final preparations for commercial drilling according to the bbc which first reported the news on friday
a rig the ensco was due to depart from singapore for the drill site on thursday the bbc said citing an unnamed energy industry source
repsol spent around million euros million on exploration in vietnam last year according to the company s profit and loss statement
repsol s top management considers the red emperor site one of the company s future growth projects
repsol which has a percent stake in the project signed a rental contract for a rig to start work on a vietnamese site in according to the statement
just under half the company s billion euro billion investments for which contracts have been signed for are in vietnam
