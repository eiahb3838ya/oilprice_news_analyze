turkmen election may become step in succession plan
almaty march reuters turkmenistan will vote in a parliamentary election on sunday which may give president kurbanguly berdymukhamedov s son a more prominent role and cement his status as a designated successor in the central asian nation
all three parties in the election support berdymukhamedov who has run the former soviet republic since tolerating no dissent and the parliament mainly laws proposed by the president who is also the head of cabinet
however the upcoming election may prompt a reshuffle among senior mps and ultimately give serdar berdymukhamedov the president s only son a bigger role possibly that of speaker or deputy speaker
serdar berdymukhamedov became a parliament deputy in a in after holding several government jobs
since then he has become a committee head and made a number of foreign visits including one to neighbouring kazakhstan this month which underscored his special status
under the turkmen constituion the speaker becomes acting president if the head of state becomes unable to carry out his work
serdar berdymukhamedov has trained as agricultural engineer and later studied diplomacy in russia and switzerland skills which he put to use during his work at the foreign ministry
his father is the centre of an elaborate personality cult and is commonly referred to as arkadag or protector who in official parlance is overseeing an era of might and happiness
turkmenistan s economy depends heavily on exports of natural gas and came under stress after russia once the biggest buyer halted all purchases of turkmen gas in
its main customer now is china and the ashgabat government is building a new pipeline through afghanistan to pakistan and china in an attempt to open up new export markets
for ordinary turkmens lower export revenues have manifested themselves in foreign currency shortages and foreign exchange restrictions
the black market flourished as a result where the turkmen manat currency trades at less than a third of its official value
