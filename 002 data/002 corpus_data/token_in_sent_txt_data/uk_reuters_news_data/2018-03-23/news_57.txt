boeing will not appeal case against bombardier - spokesman
march reuters boeing co will not appeal against the trade commission ruling that allows canada s bombardier inc to sell its newest jets to airlines without heavy duties a boeing spokesman said on thursday
the international trade commission itc unanimously voted in january to reject boeing s complaint and discarded a commerce department recommendation to slap a near percent duty on sales of the bombardier cseries jets for five years
the itc had widely been expected to side with boeing the world s largest maker of jetliners which accused bombardier of dumping the planes or selling them below cost in the market
