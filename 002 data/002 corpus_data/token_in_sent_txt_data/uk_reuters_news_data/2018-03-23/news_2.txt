venezuela oil workers clash with security officials in pdvsa cafeteria protest
caracas march reuters angry venezuelan oil workers demanding better benefits to counter crushing hyperinflation and food shortages clashed with security officials during a rare protest in the cafeteria of state oil company pdvsa s headquarters on friday
venezuela is home to the world s largest crude reserves but its creaking economic model has all but collapsed sparking inflation and long lines for everything from milk to medicines
many struggling oil workers have kept mum for fear of losing their jobs and health insurance as president nicolas maduro s government takes an increasingly tough line on dissent
but in a rare display of public anger dozens of oil workers blocked access to the cafeteria that caters to pdvsa and the adjacent oil ministry during lunch hour on friday to demand the payment of delayed benefits three sources close to pdvsa told reuters
videos circulating on social media showed workers pushing and shoving with national guard soldiers trying to keep order
get out the employees are heard yelling as a huge photo of late leader hugo chavez towers above the mayhem
workers also shouted resign in an apparent reference to current pdvsa president and oil minister manuel quevedo a major general with no oil experience tapped late last year to replace his predecessor arrested for alleged graft
the poor work environment comes as venezuela s oil production has slipped to a near low of around million barrels per day due to lack of investment rampant crime in isolated oil fields and a brain drain
pdvsa did not respond to a request for comment
