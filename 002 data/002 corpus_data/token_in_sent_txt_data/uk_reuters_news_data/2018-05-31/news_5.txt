update 7-u.s. crude tumbles, widening brent's premium to 3-year high
new york reuters oil fell nearly percent on thursday despite a decline in crude inventories while global benchmark brent was little changed pushing the spread between the two to its widest in more than three years
crude stockpiles fell million barrels last week the energy information administration said exceeding expectations for a decline of barrels
gasoline and diesel stocks rose but the crude drawdown was a salve for recent losses in futures
brent crude losses were more limited as the prospect that the organization of the petroleum exporting countries will bring its deal to a close by the end of the year has had a greater effect on the benchmark due to ongoing worries about infrastructure constraints
the market is concerned that in the longer term increases in oil production combined with refining problems and limited outbound pipeline capacity said andrew lipow president of lipow oil associates in houston
crude production has been rising to record high levels since late last year
in march it jumped bpd to million bpd a new monthly record the eia said on thursday
brent crude futures for august ended down cents to a barrel while west texas intermediate july crude settled or percent lower at a barrel
at one point the premium for brent over wti surpassed a barrel the largest spread since march
that spread has doubled in less than a month as a lack of pipeline capacity in the united states has trapped a lot of output inland
the is blowing out
i think there must be what looks like some capitulation going on in the spread between those two contracts saxo bank senior manager ole hansen said
the wider premium makes crude exports more competitive than those linked to the brent price such as north sea or west african grades of oil
brent had hit a low below a barrel on monday after opec and its allies including russia indicated they could adjust their deal to curb supplies and increase production
opec and producers have committed to cut output by million bpd until the end of but are ready to make gradual supply adjustments to deal with shortages a gulf source familiar with saudi thinking told reuters late on wednesday
that news helped boost brent as it suggests a slightly less committal approach to adding barrels to the market
sources told reuters last week that saudi arabia the effective leader of opec and russia were discussing boosting output by about million bpd to compensate for losses in supply from venezuela and to address concerns about the impact of sanctions on iranian output
the fact that we saw the announcement last week could have attracted some interest in narrowing the spread given that we were looking for some of the geopolitical risk in brent to be removed but that s been overtaken by the domestic widening in crude prices in the hansen said
prices for physical barrels of light sweet crude delivered at midland are at their largest discount to the benchmark futures price in almost four years
concerns about bottlenecks are contributing to the decline in futures as well
