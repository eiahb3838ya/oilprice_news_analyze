poll-oil to hold above $70, demand to counter any opec supply rise
reuters oil will stay above a barrel this year because strong demand and possible supply disruptions in iran and venezuela will put pressure on global inventories even though opec and russia are considering raising output a reuters poll showed on thursday
a survey of economists and analysts forecast brent crude to average per barrel in about higher than forecast in last month s poll and just above the average so far this year
oil fundamentals have been increasingly positive for oil prices of late
geopolitical events surrounding iran and venezuela augur further oil supply loss adding to that already generated by opec and allied producer restraint said harry tchilinguirian global head of commodity market strategy at bnp paribas
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and several other producers agreed to cut output from january by million barrels per day bpd to cut a global surplus
this has led to a rapid decline in inventories
the drawdown along with concerns about further supply disruptions from venezuela and renewed sanctions against iran fuelled a recent rally in prices driving benchmark brent above a barrel in may to its highest since november
to compensate for the drop in supply saudi arabia and russia have been in talks ahead of a key opec meeting in vienna in june to raise oil production by million bpd
as a result the oil price has dropped by about percent from this month s peak
any increase in output from saudi arabia and russia will be a bearish price signal especially when the output is also climbing said abhishek kumar senior energy analyst at interfax energy s global gas analytics in london
however some analysts say higher output from saudi arabia and russia will not fully compensate for losses from venezuela and iran and will only keep prices capped in the near term
we expect that the production will be gradual a ramp up of bpd every month until
this is probably not enough to bring the market back into surplus said jan edelmann commodities analyst at hsh nordbank ag
the survey forecast wti crude futures will average a barrel this year around percent lower than the forecast for brent
cheap oil relative to international benchmarks will lead to rising demand for crude commerzbank analyst carsten fritsch said
production in united states is forecast to hit a record high in june widening the premium of brent to light crude to its biggest since march at about a barrel
oil production has surged by more than percent in the past two years to million bpd and analysts forecast it to grow by about million to million bpd this year
