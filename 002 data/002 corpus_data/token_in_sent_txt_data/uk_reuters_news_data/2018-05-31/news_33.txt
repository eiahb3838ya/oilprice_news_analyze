rising oil prices bring hope to gloomy canada sector
calgary may reuters years of low oil prices and high costs spurred a stampede by multinational majors out of canada s oil sands last year leaving the remaining crude producers struggling to weather painful drops in profit
environmentalists derided the tar sands as too dirty for investment and analysts said the region s high production costs made little sense in a world of oil
but this month global benchmark prices rebounded to per barrel cheering oil executives in the canadian energy capital of calgary alberta who are shifting from survival mode to cautious expansion to capitalize on healthier cash flow expected this year
although most producers remain hesitant to commit substantial new capital a few are restarting mothballed wells and many are pencilling out tentative plans for their extra cash as investors brighten their outlooks for the sector
plunging output from competitor venezuela amid a sprawling crisis in its socialist government s oil firm pdvsa adds further opportunity for sales of canadian crude to gulf of mexico refiners
it hurts on the downside but boy is there opportunity on the way up said ed lafehr chief executive of baytex energy corp which drills in western canada and texas
the improved prospects are already translating into job creation in an economy where the oil sands fortunes are so critical that the nation s currency rises and falls in step with oil futures prices
matt munro canada market manager for recruiter petroplan said the sector s job postings have more than doubled so far this year compared with and salaries are up particularly in oilfield services
one company for example has boosted base salaries before bonuses from c to c in the past months munro said
average weekly salaries for oil and gas extraction workers in alberta jumped percent from february to february according to the most recent available data from statistics canada
the number of people employed by alberta resource companies meanwhile jumped percent to nearly in the same period the data showed though that is still well below the august peak of about people
for a graphic on employment and pay in alberta see baytex delayed starting production on three wells in the first quarter but now plans to launch the wells this spring lafehr said
the company s hedging strategy could prevent it from reaping the full upside of higher prices this year
but if prices hold it may see an extra c million million in free cash flow in which it could use to expand output and repay debt lafehr said
heavy oil producer blackpearl resources inc shut down wells in the first quarter that were not worth the expense of maintenance work at lower oil prices
now it s restarting them to capture profits from the rebound
with benchmark west texas intermediate crude prices up percent so far this year blackpearl ceo john festival is mulling further expansion further next year
higher prices certainly help the mood he said
at current prices blackpearl might move more quickly to boost production at its onion lake saskatchewan project which it had expected to expand by barrels per day bpd in he said
beyond those tentative steps festival will hold back on more substantial investments to see if market dynamics can sustain higher prices
one month of good prices is not enough to cause us to commit festival said
the recent upturn by no means solves the structural problems in canada s sector that were exposed when global prices crashed starting in from a height of more than a barrel
oil sands drilling costs remain high and western canada is still producing far more oil than its congested pipelines can deliver
the crisis is so severe in fact that many companies are shipping their oil one truckload at a time at steep costs for a lack of cheaper pipeline and rail options
on tuesday the canadian government announced it would take the drastic step of purchasing the trans mountain pipeline from kinder morgan canada ltd in a bid to rescue an expansion project facing fierce opposition in british columbia
high transportation costs translate into deep discounts on western canadian oil relative to the benchmark with the gap reaching a barrel in january the biggest in four years
that has since narrowed to as little as but the reduction is mainly due to oil producers taking more maintenance downtime earlier in the year than planned reducing the strain on pipelines
even so big canadian producers that snapped up stakes from the retreating foreign owners during the downturn are for any sustained rebound
rising prices have sparked dramatic shift in the expectations for oil sands producers this year equity analysts at eight capital said in a may report
the analysts raised share price targets of canadian natural resources cenovus energy and suncor energy
suncor and canadian natural may fare particularly well because they have secured enough pipe capacity for their current operations both firms said last month
suncor also has space lined up for output from its stake in fort hills the oil sands newest mine
for every per barrel prices climb suncor s cash flows rise by about million
investors have noticed the reversal of fortune in the oil patch
the tsx energy index has gained percent since its low in early february
higher oil prices make more regions like the oil sands considerations again for wary investors said trip rodgers portfolio manager at bp capital fund advisors which currently focuses upstream investments on shale producers
you re able to look at names that may not be as higher prices are whetting appetites for more mergers and acquisitions said andrew botterill national oil and gas leader at deloitte which advises producers
even so he said canadian oil companies are more mature than they were before prices collapsed in recent years and are likely to take a measured path to growth he said
