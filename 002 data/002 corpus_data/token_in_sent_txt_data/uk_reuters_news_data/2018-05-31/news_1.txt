update 4-brazil returns to uneasy calm as protests wind down
rio de paulo reuters brazil showed signs of returning to normal on thursday as an oil workers union ended a strike ahead of schedule and an trucker protest wound down a welcome breather for a government suffering from approval levels
oil workers union fup unexpectedly recommended on thursday that members suspend a strike they began on wednesday after a court said the organisation would be fined if it continued
meanwhile the truckers protest which has strangled much of brazil s economy for days petered out
brazil s minister of institutional security sergio etchegoyen said all roadblocks had been removed though isolated groups of truckers were still causing problems
the end of the strike is some rare good news for president michel temer brazil s least popular president since its return to democracy in the
the protests which were widely supported by brazilians had seen calls among some strikers and fringe groups for a military coup
temer said this week that there was zero chance of such an intervention
it also provides some relief for oil firm petroleo brasileiro sa or petrobras as it is commonly known
petrobras has been caught between workers and some politicians that want the company to roll back recent policies and investors who are fleeing on fears that it may undo those changes
its shares have tumbled around percent in the past two weeks
petrobras chief executive pedro parente who workers want to resign is set to meet temer on friday morning
petrobras said on thursday that there was no impact on production due to the strike as its contingency plans were successful
laborers were back on the job at percent of the company s units the company added

santos latin america s largest port was now functioning admiral ademir sobrinho said in broadcast comments
but a representative from shipping firm maersk line ltd said the port was still far from operating normally
we have seen some critical imports being released from terminals in the santos complex
still we expect brazilian export volumes will continue to be seriously impacted for the next few weeks said antonio dominguez managing director for the company s east coast south america cluster
at gas stations in sao paulo brazil s largest city lines remained long
produce at supermarkets cost more than usual in some locations even as supplies were returning to normal
companies in the machinery industry were crafting plans with workers for collective vacations while others were planning layoffs the head of the industry s trade group jose velloso told reuters late on wednesday as an inability to obtain supplies or deliver products hit virtually all firms in the sector
to win over the blockading truckers who were primarily protesting high fuel prices the government agreed to lower the average cost of fuel by centavos per litre
to pay for the cuts the government announced on wednesday that it would slash a subsidy for exporters and reduce benefits for beverage makers operating in the zona franca low tax zone which will hit companies such as femsa sab de cv and ambev sa
beverage industry group abir criticised the move although the rival afrebras group which tends to represent producers many of them outside the zona franca called the change long overdue
those measures along with other cost saving moves will boost government coffers by billion reais million pounds authorities said
