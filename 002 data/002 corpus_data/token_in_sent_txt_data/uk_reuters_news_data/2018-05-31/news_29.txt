column-south korea's sulphur cap alters asian coal market dynamics: russell
repeats item issued earlier
the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
by clyde russell launceston australia may reuters south korea s imposition of a strict sulphur cap on its imported coal is likely to cause ripples across asia s markets for the polluting fuel both in the short and longer terms
from july south korean utilities will be restricted to burning coal with an average sulphur content of percent over the course of the year part of government measures to combat air pollution
such a low sulphur limit effectively knocks out much of the thermal coal from australia which generally produces coal with a high energy value but also higher sulphur content than rivals such as indonesia russia and south africa
australia is the supplier of coal to south korea behind indonesia and has already been losing market share so far this year
and port data compiled by thomson reuters supply chain and commodity forecasts show a total of million tonnes of australian coal being discharged in south korea in the first five months of this year down percent from the same period in
while coal imports from australia held up well in the first four months they have fallen sharply in may to million tonnes according to the data
this is a drop of percent from may of last year showing that south korean utilities are already attempting to source coal from producers
customs data for the first four months of shows that south korea imported million tonnes from australia down from million for the same period in
from indonesia imports dropped to million tonnes from million while those from russia jumped to million from million and south african shipments rose to million from million
what this suggests is that south korean utilities are cutting back on imports from australia but aren t switching to indonesia rather preferring to buy more from russia and south africa
this means that the utilities are still seeking higher energy coal but with a lower sulphur content such as that produced in russia and south africa
indonesia s coal tends to be low sulphur but also of low calorific value meaning more has to be burned to produce the same amount of energy
the question for the seaborne coal market is how much impact will south korea s switch to coal have given that it is the world s importer behind china india and japan
in theory prices for australian coal should decline while those for south african and russian supplies should advance but the reality may be more nuanced than that
about million tonnes of australia s annual thermal coal exports meet the new south korean specification according to consultants wood mackenzie
that s less than a quarter of the country s total annual thermal coal exports but is still sufficiently large to enable south korean utilities to switch to buying only cargoes
what this may mean in practical terms is that australian coal starts to enjoy a rising premium over fuel with a higher sulphur content even if the calorific values are the same
this may benefit buyers in countries such as japan and china who may be able to buy higher sulphur australian coal and would be happy to take it at a discount to what they are currently paying
chinese utilities are known to buy but indonesian coal for blending with higher energy coal
the price for south african coal may also move higher if south korea starts to boost demand and there is some evidence in the pricing that this is occurring
the price of coal at south africa s main export port of richards bay as assessed by argus media ended last week at a tonne while the price of similar grade coal at australia s newcastle port was at
this means the australian coal was at a a tonne premium to the south african fuel which is down from the at the end of last year
there are of course other reasons for south african coal to outperform australian including rising demand from south asian countries such as pakistan
however russian coal in the pacific market also seems to have outperformed australian slightly in recent months with the price at the port of vostochny in nakhodka ending last week at below the newcastle equivalent narrowing from the a tonne that prevailed in
while the seaborne market is likely to adjust to the new south korean rules by shifting around who buys what from whom it s unlikely that this will signal a dramatic shift in prices
however the market should also consider the question as to whether south korea is the harbinger of more restrictions on sulphur which would have more serious consequences for australia and for the operating costs of asian utilities
