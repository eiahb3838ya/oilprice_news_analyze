volcanic lava flow spurs more evacuations on hawaii's big island
honolulu may reuters molten rock from several fissures opened by kilauea volcano crept toward clusters of homes and vacation rentals on the eastern tip of hawaii s big island on wednesday as authorities ushered residents from the area as a precaution
evacuation of the vacationland development and adjacent kapoho community rebuilt after a destructive eruption of kilauea in came on the day of what geologists rank as one of the biggest upheavals in a century from one of the world s most active volcanoes
the hawaii county civil defense agency issued the advisory as lava flows picked up speed late on tuesday and early on wednesday and threatened to cut off a key traffic route into the seaside area on the far eastern flank of the volcano
residents in the kapoho area including kapoho beach lots and vacationland are advised to evacuate the agency said in a morning bulletin
you are at risk of being isolated due to possible lava inundation of beach on tuesday a lava stream crossed a larger route highway as it advanced toward kapoho
a separate flow of molten rock was headed in the direction of the vacationland hawaii community to the south
civil defense officials also cited the problem of widespread communication outages in the area due to downed power and phone lines reinforcing the decision to proceed with evacuation plans immediately rather than wait for a potential emergency
residents of the area part of the island of hawaii s puna district were urged to stay tuned to local radio stations for further updates
the numbers of people and homes affected by the evacuation were not immediately known
they join some residents displaced due to lava flows and toxic sulfur dioxide gas emissions at the outset of the eruption nearly four weeks ago farther west in and around the leilani estates community
kilauea s main crater at the volcano s summit has continued to periodically belch ash high up into the sky
but national weather service meteorologist tom birchard told reporters during a conference call that most of the ash was blowing out to sea on the prevailing trade winds then dissipating quickly
nevertheless some ash and fumes have been spouted high enough into the atmosphere to be carried far over the pacific ocean with observers in the marshall islands micronesia and guam detecting traces of vog a hazy mix of sulfur dioxide aerosols moisture and fine particles birchard said
kilauea rumbled back to life on may as it began extruding lava and toxic gases through a series of cracks in the ground on its eastern flank marking the latest phase of an eruption cycle that has continued nearly nonstop for years
the occurrence of new lava vents or fissures now numbering about two dozen have been accompanied by flurries of earthquakes and intermittent eruptions from the summit crater
more than homes and other structures have been consumed by lava flows since then
