norway parliament to debate next year whether wealth fund can invest in unlisted renewables
oslo reuters norway s parliament should discuss next year whether the country s trillion sovereign wealth fund should be able to invest in unlisted renewable projects such as solar parks and wind farms parliament s finance committee said on thursday
norwegian politicians have been debating whether the world s largest sovereign wealth fund should invest in a new asset class on top of the stocks bonds and real estate it holds
while there had been broad support to allow the fund to invest in renewable infrastructure the minority government said in march it was too early to present a bill to parliament on the subject and did not provide a precise timeline
on thursday a united finance committee instructed the government to present a bill next year on the topic so parliament could debate and vote on the question a key lawmaker told reuters
we want to have a better balance between the fund s return and risk said svein roald hansen the lawmaker who led the committee s work on the government s white paper
green groups welcomed the news as it will likely be voted through next year
the ruling conservatives the opposition labour party and at least five smaller parties are in favour
this is an important contribution to achieve climate targets said baard vegar solhjell head of the wwf conservation group in norway
the government said in march it was concerned about the political risk of the fund being stuck in a problematic investment it can not get out of as easily as if it were a listed company
the fund is managed by a unit of the central bank called norges bank investment management
parliament decides the fund s mandate
the committee shares that view and wants to progress carefully when it comes to allowing the fund to invest in unlisted infrastructure projects that are not renewables such as bridges or roads
other types of unlisted infrastructure are more complicated
they can break with the principles of openness and transparency of the fund parliament s hansen said
the government has also said that were the fund to be allowed to go into unlisted renewables projects it should be limited to the fund s current green investment mandate which amounted to billion norwegian crowns billion at
green groups say this is too low and the finance committee said on thursday it should be significantly higher without giving a sum
