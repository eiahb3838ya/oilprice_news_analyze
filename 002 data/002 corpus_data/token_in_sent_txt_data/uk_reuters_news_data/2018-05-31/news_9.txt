u.s. withdrawal may halt nuclear nonproliferation work in iran - diplomats
reuters the remaining parties to the iran nuclear deal have warned the united states that its decision to withdraw from the pact jeopardises russian and chinese efforts to limit iran s ability to develop atomic weapons western diplomats told reuters
in pulling out of the deal president donald trump triggered the revival of sanctions against the atomic energy organization of iran aeoi which oversees the arak heavy water research reactor and the fordow fuel enrichment plant
under the deal the arak reactor was to be redesigned to render it unable to make plutonium under normal operation while the fordow plant was to stop enriching uranium and be converted into a nuclear physics and technology centre
the restoration of sanctions on aeoi would expose companies to the risk of punishment by the united states for dealing with it including chinese china national nuclear and russia s rosatom which are doing nonproliferation work respectively at arak and fordow
neither company responded to requests for comment
at a meeting in vienna last friday the parties to the deal britain china france germany russia and iran discussed the subject extensively with beijing and moscow stressing their concerns three european diplomats said
one senior european diplomat called the situation crazy and said the withdrawal risked triggering a proliferation problem because its sanctions may halt work on arak and fordow
it may force the interruption of the dismantling of iran s nuclear sites
it s completely absurd the diplomat said
iranian officials were not immediately available for comment
asked how washington planned to address the concerns about aeoi being sanctioned and how it would serve interests not to carry out the nonproliferation work at arak and fordow assistant secretary of state christopher ford said the was aware of the other parties positions regarding aeoi
these questions are all under active consideration by the government he said in a statement relayed by a spokeswoman
our posture towards iran will be geared towards obtaining enduring nonproliferation benefits and constraining the full range of its malign the agreement between iran and world powers lifted international sanctions on tehran
in return iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities increasing the time it would need to produce an atom bomb if it chose to do so
trump abandoned the agreement on may arguing that he wanted a bigger deal that not only limited iran s atomic work but also reined in its support for proxies in syria iraq yemen and lebanon and that curbed its ballistic missile program
the remaining parties are trying to keep the deal alive
everyone is focused on preserving the economic side of the agreement said an eu diplomat
but if the remaining parties fail on the nuclear side of implementation while iran is trying to comply it would really be an the deal bars the production of enriched uranium at fordow and says russia will work with iran there on producing stable isotopes which do not pose a proliferation risk
on arak the deal specifies that the new design will aim to minimise the production of plutonium and to prevent the production of plutonium in normal operation
it also specifies the fuel arak must use and says its spent fuel for the reactor s lifetime must be shipped out of iran
sanctions that would prevent companies from dealing with aeoi are due to be reimposed no later than
the three european diplomats said russia and china had been especially vocal at the vienna meeting with one saying that the two nations indicated they were determined to carry out the nuclear projects but stressed their worries on sanctions
two other western officials also confirmed that the subject was discussed at the meeting
the which initially led a working group to redesign the arak reactor with china did not attend the vienna talks
beijing s envoy to the talks told reporters on friday that the parties needed to find a for arak to move forward
richard nephew a former administration official under president barack obama said it was unlikely the would sanction chinese or russian companies for doing work with iran although it was a possibility
the real problem is does this stop these countries and the companies from their work to render the arak and fordow facilities safer he said
if it causes them to stop that work and gives iran an excuse to restart fordow or to rebuild arak as a reactor then we will have done real damage to our nonproliferation additional reporting by alissa de carbonnel in brussels francois murphy in vienna christian lowe in moscow and david stanway in beijing writing by arshad mohammed and john irish editing by nick tattersall
