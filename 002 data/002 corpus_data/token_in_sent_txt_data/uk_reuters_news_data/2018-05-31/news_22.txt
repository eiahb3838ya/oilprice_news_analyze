the deal began in january and in theory runs until the end of
with the supply glut largely cleared and oil topping a barrel this month for the first time since opec and russia are now shifting policy and discussing pumping more although analysts expect any boost to be cautious
opec s bias to err on the side of tightening remains intact said konstantinos venetis senior economist at ts lombard
easing the restrictions just means that its line in the sand moves slightly for now though adherence by producers in the deal to agreed levels remains strong
