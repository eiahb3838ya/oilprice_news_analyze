update 2-lone star bets on china in $401 mln bid for australia's sino gas & energy
reuters australia s sino gas energy holdings ltd agreed on wednesday to a a million million takeover offer from private equity firm lone star saying the risks the company faces in china justified putting the bid to a vote
lone star is betting on two large gas projects in china where gas demand is soaring and where after many years of work sino gas energy only recently won the first of several approvals needed to develop its projects
sino gas said its shareholders will receive a per share a percent premium to its close on tuesday on the australian stock exchange asx
lone star declined to comment on the offer
the cash offer provides shareholders with cash certain value now versus the future risks and uncertainties associated with the business sino gas managing director glenn corrie told analysts and investors on a teleconference
brokers with price targets on sino gas at least percent above the offer price were surprised the board had unanimously recommended lone star s offer
we have previously highlighted the potential upside as sino gas and moves to being cash flow positive by thus we can only conclude there are greater risks the board is aware of than we have modeled macquarie analysts said in a note
small investors who have backed the company for years and just saw it secure some agreements like a recent production sharing contract with chinese oil giant cnooc ltd were unimpressed with the offer
private equity doesn t invest unless they expect to get outsized returns
why should we be giving that away craig lindner a private investor told corrie on the teleconference adding he would be voting against the offer
sino gas shares rose as much as percent before easing to trade up percent at a suggesting investors don t expect a higher bid to emerge
its shares have strongly outperformed a flat asx energy index this year surging percent to wednesday s close
shareholders are expected to vote on the offer which needs approval from percent of votes cast to proceed in late august or september
lone star made an unsuccessful million bid two years ago for australian gas producer awe ltd which was taken over earlier this year by japan s mitsui co for million
