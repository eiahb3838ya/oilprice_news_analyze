feature-in rush to electrify, cambodia stirs the living and dead
srekor cambodia june thomson reuters foundation nat sota worries about the spirits of her ancestors
they have been lying in watery graves since cambodia s newest hydroelectric dam flooded her village of srekor and with it the nearby burial ground
we don t know whether they can swim or not she said sitting under a wooden house on stilts near the dam s reservoir
nat sota has earthly concerns too
only the red roof of the village primary school is now visible above the water and she worries for her two young grandchildren if they are unable to get an education
she is among of the village s ethnic kreung bunong and lao minority families who have refused the government s offer to move them to a village
instead they have decamped to a settlement near the reservoir that flooded their homes and are now stuck in limbo
they say the government s proposed site to is too far from the sesan river where their people have fished for generations and the cash offer not enough to cover the loss of property and crops
the plight of this community in a remote corner of northern stung treng province highlights the human cost of cambodia s push to bring power to the entire country
by all villages have to have access to the electricity supply said victor jona a spokesman for the department of energy at the ministry of mines and energy
the southeast asian nation is well on its way according to world bank statistics
in only percent of cambodians had access to electricity
that increased to percent by and almost half the population was connected to the grid by
much of that progress has been driven by dams
between and hydropower s contribution to the energy mix jumped from to percent the world bank said
cambodia is considering two new dams both of which would dwarf the lower sesan in terms of size and output as well as the impact on land and fisheries
the government has provided fair compensation to those who had to make way for seven dams built so far jona said citing the lower sesan as a good he noted that most of the families in villages affected by the dam have relocated to new sites where authorities have built schools and health centres as well as providing houses and farmland
some people are not happy with the compensation he conceded
in a letter to provincial authorities the families holding out in srekor asked the government to recognise their new settlement as an indigenous community with rights to the land
the government should provide cash compensation for their lost homes and crops they said and build infrastructure including a well school and a health centre
the villagers said they stayed in their homes until rising waters forced them to move in december
the reservoir had begun filling up in late september when the lower sesan dam s floodgates were closed
underscoring its importance to cambodia s power plan prime minister hun sen inaugurated the project dismissing the concerns of radical environmentalists in his speech
the dam will be running at full capacity by the end of the year said jona with eight turbines producing a total megawatts mw of electricity
the project generated controversy even before its approval in
many of the people in six villages in the reservoir area protested and environmentalists predicted a devastating impact on fisheries
a study in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences predicted that the lower sesan dam alone would cause a percent drop in fish biomass throughout the mekong river basin
the mekong basin is the biggest inland fishery in the world said the study
but dams block migration preventing some fish from reaching areas where they feed and spawn
villagers in srekor told the thomson reuters foundation that one species of fish has already disappeared
two more hydropower projects under consideration would have an even greater impact according to two different assessments
the sambor dam proposed by the government of cambodia is probably the largest and most destructive dam in the mekong river basin according to the natural heritage institute a conservation group that assessed the project for the government
the mw dam across the mekong would be km wide m yards high and create a reservoir km long
it would be devastating for migratory fish stocks said the
upriver from sambor the proposed mw stung treng dam would inundate villages that are home to people according to the mekong river commission which is comprised of the four countries overseeing the river s development
jona said the government is now focused on constructing power plants and has not yet decided whether to build more hydroelectric dams
the dams represent an existential question for cambodia in its quest to electrify are the benefits worth the costs
in the case of the lower sesan dam the government answered yes
normally when we do a project this size development has to be balanced between environmental and social concerns said jona
but for some like kheun fut who refused to relocate and instead built a new house on high ground just metres from the reservoir s edge the cost of leaving was too high
he guided a motorised canoe through the ghostly remains of his village stopping to speak with his father who was salvaging the roof of his former home
i had a big house but now i ve lost it said noy fut as he pried corrugated metal sheets from the rafters
kheun fut used a paddle to push off from the submerged building and headed back to shore steering between tree tops and past the red and gold roof of the village s buddhist pagoda
this is development he said the canoe leaving a murky wake behind him
