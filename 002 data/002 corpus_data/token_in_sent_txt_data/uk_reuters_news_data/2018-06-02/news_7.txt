update 4-brazil's president scrambles to name new petrobras ceo
by lisandra paraguassu and alexandra alper rio de reuters brazilian president michel temer scrambled to name a new chief executive for oil producer petroleo brasileiro sa on friday after the surprise resignation of ceo pedro parente over fuel pricing policies
parente s departure wiped billion billion off the market value of the company known as petrobras and marked the highest profile casualty so far of a trucker s strike that virtually paralysed brazil for nearly two weeks
once a beacon of national pride petrobras had become engulfed in a damaging corruption scandal and overloaded with debt before turnaround wizard parente s arrival as ceo two years ago
his replacement ivan monteiro until friday petrobras chief financial officer and formerly a top executive at bank banco do brasil will be under pressure to show he can keep cutting debt and pushing policies
petrobras board said it had named monteiro as interim ceo at a rapidly organised meeting on friday and temer recommended him to take on the job on a basis later in the day
however with elections looming monteiro s tenure is likely to end in december when the president leaves office
shares in petrobras latin america s biggest oil producer closed down percent on friday wiping some billion reais billion from the company s capitalization
the real currency weakened as much as percent against the dollar
petrobras bonds also fell as moody s called parente s resignation credit negative for the company
temer sought to reassure markets as he announced his recommendation of monteiro
we will maintain the economic policy that took the company out of the red in the last two years and made it once again one of the most respected in brazil and abroad he said
there will be no interference at all in the company s pricing parente arrived at a friday morning meeting with temer with his resignation letter already in hand a company source and a person close to the government said
in it parente said he was leaving because he would not be an obstacle to new pricing policies that might be necessary to shield brazilian consumers from volatility in world oil prices
during the company posted about billion in refining losses due to unprofitable fuel prices imposed by the according to moody s
a key plank of parente s turnaround campaign for the company and a condition for his taking the top job in was freedom to control fuel prices
he sought to align those more closely with international markets through nearly daily price adjustments
but on sunday temer governing with approval ratings announced plans to placate striking truck drivers protesting the high cost of diesel by freezing fuel prices on a monthly basis and taking other measures to bring domestic diesel prices down
late on friday brazil s mines and energy ministry said it wanted to create a pricing mechanism that would protect consumers without impacting the policies of petrobras and other energy companies
although temer promised the government would compensate petrobras for losses incurred by its intervention on fuel prices sunday s move crossed parente s red line against political meddling sources said
one source close to parente said the had stepped down because he had reached his limit with government interference
another source close to temer said the president was surprised by the resignation and had not sought to push the ceo out
parente s departure comes days before brazil hopes to attract foreign oil companies to bid on oil fields in its coveted presalt exploration areas and leaves in limbo several of his key priorities including selling major refineries
also unresolved is a dispute with the government over an offshore area which could represent a windfall for petrobras if a deal is reached
parente s policies had helped pushed petrobras shares to a multiyear peak just last month but a rise in international oil prices triggered anger at brazilian gas stations and led to calls from politicians and unions for the executive to go
the company risks becoming a political football in october s presidential election with candidate jair bolsonaro s key economic adviser calling for its privatisation while leftist ciro gomes has warned investors to avoid state energy sector assets because he would expropriate them
while investors and oil industry insiders bemoaned parente s departure others rejoiced
parente was the most responsible for the crisis that brazil has faced with the trucker strike the truckers lobby said in a statement
nothing justifies the abusive diesel prices put in place by the company in the last few petrobras oil workers who walked off the job earlier week in part to demand parente s dismissal also celebrated
you don t deserve to walk through the doors of petrobras again said jose maria rangel leader of fup brazil s largest oil workers union in a video message
parente s policies had ultimately made him the scapegoat of the truckers strike and its fallout said roberto castello branco a former petrobras board member
the pressure on him was enormous he said
for the country for the company a great source of uncertainty has opened that is very dangerous he added
