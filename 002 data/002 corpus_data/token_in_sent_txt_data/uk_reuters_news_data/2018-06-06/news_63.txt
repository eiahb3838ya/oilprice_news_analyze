rpt-cove point lng facility in u.s. set for planned outage in autumn
repeats to attach to alert by osamu tsukimori yokohama japan june reuters dominion energy inc s cove point liquefied natural gas production facility in the eastern united states will undergo a brief maintenance shutdown in the autumn the company s top executive said on wednesday
it s not very long dominion s chief executive officer thomas farrell said in an interview adding the outage could be for less than a few weeks
asked whether there would be any interruption in lng exports from the site on the coast of the state of maryland farrell said that would depend on whether gas storage tanks with capacity to hold nearly billion cubic feet of the commodity were exhausted
farrell was in yokohama to attend a ceremony to celebrate last month s start of japanese imports of cove point lng and the arrival of a second cove point lng vessel at a tokyo gas terminal on wednesday morning
the imports via a contract mark a shift in global energy flows as the united states boosts oil and gas exports from shale formations
a of goods purchases by japan may draw some of the sting from president donald trump s criticisms of the asian nation s trade imbalance with the united states
the cove point facility with a nameplate annual capacity of million tonnes of lng has been at full production of lng from natural gas since april farrell said
you ll see a very significant increase in natural gas coming to asia and in particular japan he said
shale drilling techniques have unlocked probably years of natural gas that we will be exporting toward our allies across the world for decades and dominion sold the project s capacity for years to a subsidiary of gail india and to st cove point a joint venture between units of japanese trading company sumitomo corp and tokyo gas
tokyo gas has a contract to buy million tonnes a year of cove point lng for years while kansai electric power has contracted to take tonnes a year
there are no plans to build additional trains at the cove point terminal because there is no land available farrell added
asked whether there are any plans for similar lng export projects elsewhere he said that s possible but that would be in the future
we don t have any present plans to do that
