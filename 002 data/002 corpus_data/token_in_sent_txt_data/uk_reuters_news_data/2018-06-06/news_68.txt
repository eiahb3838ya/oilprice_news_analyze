update 1-scores more homes destroyed by lava flow on hawaii's big island
pahoa hawaii reuters a growing river of molten rock flowing from a fissure at the foot of kilauea volcano is believed to have demolished scores of additional homes and filled in a small bay at the eastern tip of hawaii s big island civil defence officials said on tuesday
the latest estimates up to more structures than previously counted as destroyed by lava smothering two newly evacuated subdivisions could bring the total number of homes and other buildings lost over the past month to nearly
such a tally would put property losses from the current upheaval of kilauea which entered its day on tuesday on par with the structures destroyed by lava during all years of the volcano s last eruption cycle which began in
the hawaii county civil defence agency was putting the confirmed number of buildings lost to the current eruption at on monday mostly residential properties
about of those were destroyed in the leilani estates community where fissures in the ground first opened on may downhill from the volcano s eastern flank
another homes were confirmed destroyed at the weekend when a large lava stream creeping miles km across the landscape reached the far eastern edge of the big island pouring into the ocean at kapoho bay
a civil defence official told reuters on tuesday at least to more homes were believed to have been devoured as the lava flow measuring about half a mile wide and to feet meters tall inundated the adjacent subdivisions of kapoho beach lots and vacationland
the official said aerial surveillance of the area showed only the northern portion of kapoho beach and the southernmost sliver of vacationland the latter consisting of only about half a dozen homes were left unscathed
civil defence spokeswoman janet snyder said later county tax records show the two subdivisions consist of homes combined and that many of those homes are feared she said it would be some time before precise losses were confirmed
video footage from a helicopter showed two seaside homes engulfed in flames as clouds of white steam and hydrochloric acid fumes billowed from the water where lava was pouring into the ocean
civil defence officials said kapoho bay itself had been filled in with lava that extended of a mile from what had been the shoreline
what used to be the bay is now all lava bed new land almost a mile out into the ocean the civil defence spokesman said
authorities began evacuating the greater kapoho area last week and ushered most of the last remaining residents to safety early on saturday hours before the lava flow severed all road access to the region
several holdouts were airlifted by helicopter on sunday leaving no more than a handful of people who refused to leave officials said
barbara mcdaniel a retiree who moved with her husband to vacationland from washington state five years ago said they fled as soon as evacuations began taking little else but their dog and cat with them
they worried their house would be spared by the lava but rendered inaccessible leaving them stuck with the mortgage for an abandoned home and a fire insurance policy that was of no value she told reuters
right now i m hoping that it burns down she said
