kazakhstan poised to rival russia over central asian fuel market
kazakhstan set to complete upgrade of its oil refineries to become net exporter of oil products in the region astana moving further away from moscow s political clout by alla afanasyeva moscow june reuters kazakhstan is set to rival russian firms in the lucrative central asian fuel market once it finishes upgrading its oil refineries officials in astana and industry sources said
the government is considering halting light oil product imports from russia and lifting a ban on such exports that was originally imposed to ensure reliable supplies on the domestic market they said
astana has been looking at selling into other former soviet republics and beyond a market dominated by russia for some time
central asia and afghanistan are the key markets for kazakhstan energy minister kanat bozumbayev said last year
but now kazakhstan the region s second biggest crude oil producer after russia is achieving a surplus over its own gasoline and diesel needs meaning it can start acting on the idea
kazakhstan is rapidly expanding production at its three large refineries
it has completed upgrading the pavlodar plant with work at atyrau and shymkent expected to be finished soon the energy ministry said in response to reuters questions
the plants combined annual oil products output will increase by eight percent to million tonnes this year while gasoline and diesel production will exceed kazakhstan s domestic demand by million tonnes per year the energy ministry said
despite producing million barrels of crude per day kazakhstan has long imported oil products from its former master russia due to the past lack of refining capacity
these amount to around million tonnes a year
its ambitions mark another step away from moscow for kazakhstan where around percent of the population are fluent russian speakers but which is planning to a switch to a alphabet from cyrillic
kazakhstan has already faced overproduction of gasoline this year which has led to lower prices
aiming to remove the surplus the government plans to ban imports of the popular grade of gasoline and secure a deal to supply neighbouring kyrgyzstan the energy ministry told reuters in an email
the government wants to start active discussions of these issues in parliament in june a source close to the government said
according to the energy ministry estimates imports of russian gasoline reached tonnes in surpassing the plan of tonnes
for the whole of russia is set to supply tonnes of gasoline tonnes of diesel and tonnes of jet fuel to kazakhstan as moscow raises exports due to its own extensive refineries modernisation
kazakhstan in its turn may export tonnes of gasoline this year increasing to tonnes in according to industry sources and reuters calculations
combined annual imports of light oil products by kyrgyzstan tajikistan and afghanistan stand at around million tonnes
kazakhstan s energy ministry declined to comment on the figures
russia s rosneft gazprom neft and forteinvest are the main players on the central asian fuel market
spokespeople for all three companies declined to comment
however a source at gazprom neft which has a network of gasoline stations in the region said that the company may consider buying gasoline and diesel from kazakhstan if it is more profitable than shipments from russia
