however he added ongoing talks between the french government and european commission could change which concessions statkraft would bid for when and in what order
france is a very interesting energy market and shows high potential for statkraft s core competence
statkraft has actively prepared for market opening over the last few years and is ready for the competition he said
france has megawatts of installed hydropower capacity second after nuclear energy
