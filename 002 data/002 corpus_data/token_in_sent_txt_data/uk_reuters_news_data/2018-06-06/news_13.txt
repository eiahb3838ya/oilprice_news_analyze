oil demand could keep growing until 2050 in conflict-ridden world - equinor
oslo reuters global oil demand could peak in the early if countries pull together to hit climate goals or keep growing until in a world according to norwegian oil and gas firm equinor
expectations for when oil demand will peak could change the supply dynamics as investors weigh up whether to back projects or to reduce their risks by focusing on investments with more rapid returns such as shale oil it said
an oil market in potential decline increases the uncertainty the producers face reduces their investment horizon and increases the focus on short payback periods for investments equinor said in its new energy outlook
equinor formerly known as statoil changed its name on may to reflect its strategy of becoming a broad energy company
it plans to increase investments in renewable energy to percent of its total capital expenditure by
oil demand in varies between million and million barrels per day bpd in its three scenarios called renewal reform and rivalry compared with million bpd in
the renewal scenario is consistent with the goal of the paris climate agreement to limit a rise in the world s average surface temperatures to below degrees celsius above times
the reform scenario based on a continuation of existing policy and technology trends sees oil demand peaking at million bpd around and declining to million bpd in
the geopolitical backdrop in rivalry is a fluid volatile and world where a lack of trust prevents countries from addressing climate change effectively
the value proposition of democracy declines with many parts of the world now ruled by dictators and autocrats some of whom are intent on exporting their authoritarian political models
other issues than climate dominate the energy policy agendas equinor said of this scenario
the pace of transport electrification energy efficiency and black swan events such as a commercial breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology a potential source of safe and green energy could also impact demand equinor added
however as the natural decline in existing production will likely be faster than the decline in oil demand new investments will be need to close the gap
even under the renewal scenario some billion barrels of oil will be needed by from new sources more than the total supply from opec countries over the last years equinor said
