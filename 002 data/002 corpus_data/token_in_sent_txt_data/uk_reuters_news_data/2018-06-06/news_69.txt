in polluted india, engineers find novel way to fight diesel exhaust
new delhi reuters india has some of the worst air pollution in the world and smog levels often spike during its sweltering summers when diesel generators are used to offset power shortages as and fans stoke consumption
but a team of indian engineers has figured out how to capture some of the generator exhaust and turn it into ink keeping the emissions from entering the atmosphere
they say they have created the device to capture emissions specifically from diesel generators a welcome invention for a country that has of the world s most polluted cities the world health organization who says
we are aiming to bring down pollution levels in the major cities by a very significant percentage in a very short span of time said arpit dhupar one of three engineers who developed the technology now installed in gurugram a satellite city of new delhi the capital
their device attaches to generators to capture up to percent of soot particles from cooled diesel exhaust
the material can then be sold to ink manufacturers
their company chakr innovation has installed devices in government firms and offices as well as real estate developers dhupar said saving billion liters of air from pollution
it has collected over kg lb of soot which has been used to create more than liters of ink he added
chakr innovations is not the first to see cash in diesel exhaust
a competitor called graviky labs based in the southern city of bangalore is using similar technology to turn diesel exhaust from vehicles into ink
about million people die each year from the effects of india s air pollution a survey by the health effects institute showed accounting for about a quarter of total air pollution deaths worldwide
