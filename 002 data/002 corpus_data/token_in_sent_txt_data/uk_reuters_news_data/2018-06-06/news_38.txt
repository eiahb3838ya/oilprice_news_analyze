update 1-european refiners winding down purchases of iranian oil
london reuters european refiners are winding down oil purchases from iran closing the door on a fifth of the opec member s crude exports after the united states imposed sanctions on tehran company and trading sources said
the drop in crude purchases from the islamic republic could complicate efforts by european governments to salvage the iranian nuclear deal disavowed by president donald trump last month
although european governments have not followed washington by creating new sanctions banks insurers and shippers are gradually severing ties with iran under pressure from the restrictions making trade with tehran complicated and risky
trump on may announced his decision to quit the landmark nuclear deal between iran and world powers and reimposed sanctions on tehran
the restrictions on iran s oil sector take effect after a period ending on
ministers from germany france and britain have urged officials to shield european companies from the sanctions but refiners are not taking any chances
we can not defy the united states said a senior source at italy s saras which operates the bpd sarroch refinery in sardinia
saras is determining how best to halt its purchasing of iranian oil within the permitted days the source said adding it is not clear yet what the administration can do but in practice we can get into refiners including france s total italy s eni and saras spain s repsol and cepsa as well as greece s hellenic petroleum are preparing to halt purchases of iranian oil once sanctions bite the sources said
these refiners account for most of europe s purchases of iranian crude which represent around a fifth of the country s oil exports

that effectively means it will be unable to keep purchasing crude

repsol and hellenic petroleum declined to comment

graphic iran crude oil trade some of the refiners including cepsa are considering whether to request a waiver from authorities to continue buying beyond the november deadline in order to complete their term agreements
with a contract in place we re hoping to get a waiver an industry source close to cepsa said
from november we don t know if any cuts will have to be partial or crude trade between iran and europe has risen sharply since the lifting of tough sanctions on tehran in
but banks shipping firms and insurance companies are now distancing themselves from the islamic republic leaving europe s refiners few options but to stop oil purchases
it s a matter of finding a tanker and an insurer that will cover it
it s definitely not easy right now a source at repsol said
