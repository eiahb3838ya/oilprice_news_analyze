trump administration biofuels deal delayed indefinitely -sources
reuters the trump administration has indefinitely delayed a proposed overhaul of biofuels policy aimed at reducing costs for the oil industry under pressure from corn state lawmakers who worry the move would undermine demand for ethanol according to two sources familiar with the matter
the white house had been poised to announce the reforms to the renewable fuel program early this week after hosting months of difficult negotiations between representatives of the key constituencies
the announcement won t be happening one of the sources said
the second source said the deal had apparently collapsed
both sources asked not to be identified discussing the matter
the rfs requires oil refiners to mix increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol into the nation s fuel each year and prove compliance by earning or acquiring blending credits that must be handed in to the environmental protection agency
the law has helped midwest corn farmers by creating a market for ethanol but refining companies have complained it incurs steep costs for them
the white house deal would have eased pressure on the refining industry by allowing biofuels exports to count toward the annual volumes quotas
it would also have expanded sales of gasoline in a concession to biofuels producers
