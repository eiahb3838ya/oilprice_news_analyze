plastic waste in antarctica reveals scale of global pollution - greenpeace
oslo reuters plastic waste and toxic chemicals found in remote parts of the antarctic this year add to evidence that pollution is spreading to the ends of the earth environmental group greenpeace said on thursday
microplastics tiny bits of plastic from the breakdown of everything from shopping bags to car tires were detected in nine of water samples collected off the antarctic peninsula by a greenpeace vessel in early it said
and seven of nine snow samples taken on land in antarctica found chemicals known as pfas polyfluorinated alkylated substances which are used in industrial products and can harm wildlife
we may think of the antarctic as a remote and pristine wilderness frida bengtsson of greenpeace s protect the antarctic campaign said in a statement about the findings
but from pollution and climate change to industrial krill fishing humanity s footprint is clear she said
these results show that even the most remote habitats of the antarctic are contaminated with microplastic waste and persistent hazardous the united nations environment agency says plastic pollution has been detected from the arctic to antarctica and in remote places including the mariana trench the deepest part of the world s oceans in the pacific
on tuesday it said that less than a of all the plastic ever made has been recycled and governments should consider banning or taxing bags or food containers to stem a tide of pollution
last year researchers at the university of hull and the british antarctic survey found that levels of microplastic in antarctica were five times higher than expected only counting local sources such as research stations and ships
that means that the pollution is crossing the southern ocean often considered as a barrier to pollution
scientists say the impacts on marine life are unknown
at the other end of the world researchers in germany reported in april that sea ice floating on the arctic ocean contains large amounts of plastic waste which could be released as the ice thins because of global warming
plastic stays around for hundreds of years said author ilka peeken of the alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research
in trying to understand the spread of pollution she told reuters that new areas for research could include how far tiny bits of plastic are getting blown on winds to the arctic and how much is swept by ocean currents
