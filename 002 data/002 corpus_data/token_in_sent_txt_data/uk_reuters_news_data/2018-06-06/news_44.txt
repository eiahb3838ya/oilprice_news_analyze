iran stands ground on nuclear inspections as france warns of red line
june reuters iran will not cooperate more fully with atomic inspectors until a standoff over its nuclear deal is resolved its envoy said as one signatory warned tehran against moving ahead with preparations to boost its uranium enrichment capacity
european powers have been scrambling to salvage the agreement they signed in since president donald trump pulled washington out last month and said he would reimpose sanctions on iran
foreign and finance ministers from those three countries france britain and germany have written to officials to stress their commitment to upholding the pact and to urge washington to spare eu firms active in iran from secondary sanctions
an iranian withdrawal from the deal which lifted sanctions on tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme would further unsettle a region where additional conflicts would be disastrous the ministers wrote in the letter dated june and seen by reuters on wednesday
since the pullout was announced authorities in tehran have sent mixed signals on whether they believe the nuclear deal s remaining signatories which also include china and russia can salvage it
supreme leader ayatollah khamenei said on monday he had ordered preparations to increase uranium enrichment capacity if the agreement collapsed
tehran also informed the international atomic energy agency iaea the nuclear watchdog that polices restrictions placed on its activities under the deal of tentative plans to produce the feedstock for centrifuges the machines that enrich uranium
in paris on wednesday french foreign minister yves le drian told europe radio that while that initiative remained within the framework of the nuclear deal it was unwelcome and risked sailing close to a red line
emphasising that tehran s patience with european efforts to save the deal was not unlimited its envoy to the iaea said it had granted the three powers a few weeks
a few weeks means a few weeks not a few months reza najafi said outside a quarterly meeting of the agency s board of governors in vienna
he also dismissed calls by the iaea to go the extra mile in cooperating with the nuclear watchdog s inspectors telling reporters that while the standoff over the deal continued no one should expect iran to go to implement more voluntary but i should emphasize that it does not mean that right now iran will restart any activities contrary to the deal najafi added
these are only preparatory the agency has said tehran is implementing its commitments but also called for timely and proactive cooperation on providing access for snap inspections
diplomats who deal with the agency say an inspection in late april went down to the wire in terms of how quickly the iaea team gained access to one site
