exclusive-schlumberger, halliburton ready bids for petrobras output sharing deal
rio de reuters schlumberger nv and halliburton co are preparing offers for an onshore production sharing deal with brazil s petrobras two sources said a first for oil services firms in the latin american country
another source said general electric co s unit baker hughes is also studying a potential bid for the tender launched by petrobras in may
a deal would represent a novel way for the oil company to boost output from mature fields without losing control or risking capital by partnering with one of the world s largest oil service providers
such a deal would also allow oil services companies to put to use expensive equipment idled for years during the downturn in brazil s oil industry hammered by low oil prices and a massive corruption scandal at petrobras
south america s largest producer has attracted billions of dollars of investment from the world s top oil firms to develop prolific deep water oilfields
the tender or invitation to bid was addressed to the world s three top oil services companies the three people said
the firms would compete by promising to boost production from the potiguar basin s waning canto do amaro field where production began in and offering a bigger share of output to petrobras they added
under the contract the winner would provide capital to drill new wells in the area located in the coastal state of rio grande do norte in northern brazil two people said
bids are due this month but at least one of the companies has asked for an extension a person said
talks to reach such a deal were more than a year in the making people said
spokespeople for baker hughes schlumberger halliburton and petrobras declined to comment
production sharing deals are usually made by oil producers rather than oil service firms
oilfield service companies engaging in activities can be seen as competing with customers and also expose themselves to more risk from swings in oil prices
the may tender was not petrobras s only bid to boost output from mature fields
last year norway s equinor formerly statoil paid up to billion for a percent stake in petrobras s roncador one of brazil s largest oilfields in the campos basin
but potiguar basin limited output would be unlikely to draw interest from such oil majors
schlumberger the world s largest oilfield service firm has used similar deal structures elsewhere through its production management group in some cases financing projects in exchange for full service rights and a share of profits
this has taken the firm away from its traditional oil service business model
the firm s production management unit has had varying degrees of success buying stakes in oil fields and in production sharing models
on at least one deal in the shale patch it had to write off millions of dollars in losses and it has also faced payment issues for a project in ecuador
schlumberger executives have said this year that the firm was slowing project approval for the group
clinching such a deal would however represent a bigger milestone for halliburton and ge s baker hughes which have not typically taken stakes in customer projects
still baker hughes last year announced a deal with twinza oil limited to provide a range of services for the development of an offshore gas field in papua new guinea and provide a credit line to fund appraisal of the field
and halliburton signed a deal in mexico s chicontepec basin five years ago
