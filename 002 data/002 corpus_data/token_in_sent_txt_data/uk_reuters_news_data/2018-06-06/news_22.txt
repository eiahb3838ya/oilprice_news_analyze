update 2-iraq to hold manual recount of may election results
baghdad reuters iraq s parliament passed a law on wednesday ordering a nationwide manual recount of votes in the may parliamentary election lawmakers said a day after the prime minister said there had been serious violations
the move could hinder the delicate process of forming a new government raising the prospect of further uncertainty in iraq and pits the government and parliament against the election commission which is meant to be independent
the election was won by a bloc led by nationalist cleric moqtada a adversary of the united states who also opposes iran s sway in iraq
votes were counted using an electronic system that was meant to prevent fraud but is now being blamed for irregularities
prime minister haider whose bloc came in third said on tuesday there were dangerous violations and that most of the blame lay with iraq s independent high elections commission ihec high ranking members of which he banned from travel without his permission
parliament on wednesday voted for amendments to the election law which force the ihec to conduct a manual recount after it had initially declined to do so
it also suspended the commission s leadership which is to be replaced by nine judges
ihec s local chiefs in each of iraq s provinces are also to be replaced by judges all picked by iraq s supreme judicial council a text of the amendment showed
the independent high elections commission shall commit to a manual recount in all voting centres in iraq under the supervision of the supreme judicial council and with the attendance of representatives from political groups and the united nations the text of the amendment law read
the amendment also cancelled the results from overseas voting and those from displaced voters in the mainly sunni anbara salahudin diyala and nineveh provinces
it ruled out the use in future elections of electronic vote counting devices blamed for many of the violations
an ihec spokesman declined to comment and said he was unauthorised to speak on this matter to the media
iraq s highest judicial authority the supreme judicial council had said this week that the courts could not force the ihec to conduct a manual recount because the law stipulated the use of electronic vote counting devices
a spokesman for the council told reuters on wednesday that was no longer an issue now that parliament had amended the law
the new electronic vote counting system was introduced by ihec on the grounds that it could reduce fraud and speed up delivery of the results
abadi said the devices were not inspected for errors before their use and that there had been possible corruption in procuring them
baghdad awarded korean company miru systems a million million contract for the system which includes around devices to be used across the country
several political groups had voiced opposition to the use of the devices before the election but not abadi who approved their introduction and supported their use
