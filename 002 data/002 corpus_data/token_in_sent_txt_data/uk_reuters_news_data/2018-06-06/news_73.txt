the latest estimates up to more structures than previously counted as destroyed by lava smothering two newly evacuated subdivisions could bring the total number of homes and other buildings lost over the past month to nearly
such a tally would put property losses from the current upheaval of kilauea which entered its day on tuesday on par with structures destroyed by lava during all years of the volcano s last eruption cycle which began in
on monday the hawaii county civil defense agency was putting the confirmed number of buildings lost to the current eruption at mostly residential properties
about of those were destroyed in the leilani estates community where fissures in the ground first opened on may downhill from the volcano s eastern flank
another homes were confirmed destroyed this past weekend when a large lava stream creeping miles km across the landscape reached the far eastern edge of the big island pouring into the ocean at a place called kapoho bay

the lava inundating kapoho is emanating from fissure the only volcanic vent that was still belching large volumes of molten rock from the ground as of tuesday officials said
