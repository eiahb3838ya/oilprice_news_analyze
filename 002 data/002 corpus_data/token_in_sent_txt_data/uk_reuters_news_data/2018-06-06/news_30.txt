uk says irish border 'backstop' brexit proposal still being discussed
london reuters brexit secretary david davis said a backstop proposal on how to avoid a hard border between northern ireland and ireland was still being discussed
the detail of this is being discussed at the moment it s been through one cabinet committee and it s going to another one and it would be improper of me to the negotiation there but i suspect it will be fairly decisive tomorrow davis said
it s for a cabinet committee to decide on that and if they conclude then you ll see it tomorrow
it s up for them to decide he said
