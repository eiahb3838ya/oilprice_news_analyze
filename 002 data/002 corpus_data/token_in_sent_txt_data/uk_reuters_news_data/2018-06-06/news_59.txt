analysis-airlines struggle with global pilot shortage
reuters a growing shortage of airline pilots is putting the industry s recent growth at risk as planes sit idle higher salaries cut into profits and unions across the globe push for more benefits
carriers such as emirates and australia s qantas airways have poured resources into hiring but struggled in recent months to use their jets as often as their business plans dictate because of training bottlenecks
pilots at ireland s ryanair are forming unions across europe seeking better working conditions and those at air france are striking over pay
in the united states pilots who took pay cuts when carriers went bankrupt a decade ago are receiving big raises under new contracts now that airlines are posting strong profits
the surge in employee costs which rival fuel as the biggest strain on an airline s finances comes as higher oil prices are already squeezing margins
airlines say ticket prices have not kept pace with costs
these cost pressures are not about to stop imminently international air transport association iata chief economist brian pearce said at the trade group s annual meeting in sydney where iata lowered its airline profit forecast by percent citing higher fuel and labor costs
it s the symptom of a wider issue
if we look at developed economies unemployment in the oecd has fallen to lows and we are starting to get wage pressures of which pilot shortages are a symptom in our industry he told airline bosses many of whom expressed concern about a shortage on the sidelines of the iata annual meeting this week
inflation is beginning to take hold in oecd economies after years of lying dormant and pilot wages also reflect that pearce added
the high cost of pilot training and several years of earlier hiring freezes in markets like the united states and australia have deterred potential aviators from entering an industry that boeing says will need more pilots over the next years
iata estimates airline traffic will nearly double during that period so companies like canadian training group cae inc and technologies are building new flight simulators to cash in on training demand
planemakers airbus and boeing are also expanding into services like training where margins are potentially higher than building jets
and some airlines are planning to expand training programs
qantas says it will invest a million million in a new flying school to ensure a supply of pilots amid high turnover in its regional arm qantaslink
emirates opened a million fight training academy in november for up to cadets
we have a social responsibility qantas domestic ceo andrew david said
we can continue to take pilots from smaller players in this country and elsewhere but we need to give back and that is part of what we are doing here as other airlines are having to look outside their home markets competing with china where experienced foreign captains are in high demand and airlines offer annual salaries of up to tax free
there is not so much a shortage of pilots as a rising cost of attracting and retaining the pilots you need particularly the experienced ones said andrew herdman director general of the association of asia pacific airlines
there is a bidding war going in countries where average wages are relatively low pilots are being offered much cushier pay packages than other professions because they are internationally mobile and must speak english the global language of aviation
srilankan airlines has lost a steady trickle of pilots to gulf carriers srilankan ceo suren ratwatte who was an emirates pilot told reuters
we pay pretty well because the pilots going away from the company go mainly to the middle east and we tend to get very close to gulf salaries except we are living in sri lanka he said
your lifestyle is pretty thailand s bangkok airways pcl is raising pilot salaries and benefits and hiring foreigners for international flying president puttipong said
pilot unions are taking advantage of shortages to ask for better conditions for their members
dan adamus president of the air line pilots association alpa canada said canadian pilots are generally getting pay raises although salaries at mainline carriers are higher than at air canada
it s certainly harder for airlines to recruit qualified pilots he said which has led carriers to raise pay
the pilots are going to go where there is better he estimates that about canadian pilots are flying for carriers overseas such as emirates
airlines considered top employers in their home country such as qantas and british airways are not yet facing shortages of qualified applicants
iag chief executive willie walsh a former pilot at ireland s aer lingus said that there were signs of pinch points within the broader industry but that he did not believe there was a shortage
the day you see me back flying is the day you know there s a pilot shortage he said
