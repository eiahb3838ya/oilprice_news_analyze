update 1-iran stands ground on nuclear inspections as france warns of red line
reuters iran will not cooperate more fully with atomic inspectors until a standoff over its nuclear deal is resolved its envoy said as one signatory warned tehran against moving ahead with preparations to boost its uranium enrichment capacity
tehran meanwhile signalled its resolve to expand its enrichment capability by detailing plans to build advanced centrifuges the machines that enrich uranium
european powers have been scrambling to salvage the agreement they signed in since president donald trump pulled washington out last month and said he would reimpose sanctions on iran
foreign and finance ministers from those three countries france britain and germany have written to officials to stress their commitment to upholding the pact and to urge washington to spare eu firms active in iran from secondary sanctions
an iranian withdrawal from the deal which lifted sanctions on tehran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme would further unsettle a region where additional conflicts would be disastrous the ministers wrote in the letter dated june and seen by reuters on wednesday
since the pullout was announced authorities in tehran have sent mixed signals on whether they believe the nuclear deal s remaining signatories which also include china and russia can salvage it
supreme leader ayatollah khamenei said on monday he had ordered preparations to increase uranium enrichment capacity if the agreement collapsed
tehran also informed the international atomic energy agency iaea the nuclear watchdog that polices restrictions placed on its activities under the deal of tentative plans to produce the feedstock for centrifuges
in paris on wednesday french foreign minister yves le drian told europe radio that while that initiative remained within the framework of the nuclear deal it was unwelcome and risked sailing close to a red line
secretary of state mike pompeo said on twitter that washington was aware of reports iran plans to increase its uranium enrichment and he vowed not to allow tehran to develop a nuclear weapon
iran is aware of our resolve he said
emphasising that tehran s patience with european efforts to save the deal was not unlimited its envoy to the iaea said it had granted the three powers a few weeks
a few weeks means a few weeks not a few months reza najafi said outside a quarterly meeting of the agency s board of governors in vienna
he also dismissed calls by the iaea to go the extra mile in cooperating with the nuclear watchdog s inspectors telling reporters that while the standoff over the deal continued no one should expect iran to go to implement more voluntary but i should emphasise that it does not mean that right now iran will restart any activities contrary to the deal najafi added
these are only preparatory iran s nuclear chief on wednesday inaugurated work on a facility in natanz plant in central iran designed to build advanced centrifuges and said the centre would be fully functional in a month
after the supreme leader s order we prepared this centre within hours
we hope the facility to be completed in a month ali akbar salehi the head of iran s atomic energy organisation said on state television
although the move was not a violation of the nuclear deal it sent a strong signal to the west that tehran would not succumb to the pressures
answering a question about a remark by pompeo last month that iran must halt all uranium enrichment salehi said we are far beyond that point
that man has been talking for the agency has said tehran is implementing its commitments but also called for timely and proactive cooperation on providing access for snap inspections
diplomats who deal with the agency say an inspection in late april went down to the wire in terms of how quickly the iaea team gained access to one site
