update 1-wales offers funding for world's first tidal lagoon project
london reuters wales has offered million pounds million in funding to help build the swansea bay tidal lagoon ahead of a uk government decision on whether to fund the billion pound renewable energy project
britain is considering building what would be the world s first such project a km mile sea wall to capture tidal power in part to replace aging coal and nuclear plants set to close in the as well as cut carbon emissions
but the project s costs have cast doubt on its viability despite the backing of an independent review last year carried out by former energy minister charles hendry
the offer to provide a loan or to take an equity stake came from the welsh assembly and was made by wales first minister carwyn jones in a letter to british business minister greg clark
it also called for a minimum price guarantee for the electricity the project produces of pounds per megawatt hour the same as that awarded to france s edf for power from the hinkley point c nuclear plant project
a spokesman for britain s department for business energy and industrial strategy said it was considering the findings of the hendry review and that an announcement will be made in due course
project developer tidal lagoon swansea bay plc said it hoped the uk government would look positively on the proposed joint funding deal
the proposal for a joint deal with this structure is extremely constructive
we are eager to engage on it with all parties and it is a proposal we d be delighted to take to our board tidal lagoon chairman keith clarke said in a statement
the project in south wales was due to start construction in and is expected to take four years to complete
when the tide drops the difference between water levels inside and outside the lagoon causes water to pass through turbines to produce electricity
similarly when the tide rises power would be generated as water fills the lagoon
while tidal changes have been harnessed before to generate power mostly deploying a barrage across a stretch of water this would be the first to enclose it effectively creating a lagoon
