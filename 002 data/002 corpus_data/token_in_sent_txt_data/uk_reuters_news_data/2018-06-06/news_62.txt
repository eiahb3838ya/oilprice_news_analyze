french car equipment lobby group cancels july trip to iran
paris june reuters france s fiev car equipment lobby group has cancelled a july trip to iran in light of current tensions between the united states and other european powers over a iran nuclear deal
the trip has been cancelled and replaced instead by a meeting in france of our iran club so that we can reflect upon how to proceed in light of current events said fiev president jacques mauge
tensions between iran and the west have surged since president donald trump pulled the out of the nuclear deal with tehran last month calling it deeply flawed and reimposing unilateral sanctions
european powers are scrambling to save the deal under which iran curbed its nuclear programme in return for a lifting of international sanctions as they regard it as the best chance to stop tehran developing an atomic bomb
earlier this month psa group said it had begun to suspend its joint venture activities in iran to avoid sanctions after washington s withdrawal from the international nuclear deal
french oil major total also said in may that it would pull out of a gas project in iran if it could not secure a waiver from sanctions
