update 2-brazil regulator seeks comment on fuel price change frequency
adds petrobras comment paragraph rio de janeiro june reuters brazilian oil regulator anp said on tuesday it would seek public comment over a period of several weeks on a potential rule that could set limits on how often fuel prices change in the country
the comment period which will take place from june to july follows a nationwide trucker strike over diesel price hikes last month that paralyzed much of latin america s biggest economy
in an emailed statement anp said the process was aimed at soliciting suggestions about a rule that would create a minimum period for changing fuel prices
it was not clear whether the regulator had the power to restrict the frequency of fuel price changes by oil producer petroleo brasileiro sa known as petrobras
the company had adopted a policy of nearly daily adjustments under its former chief executive pricing changes in alignment with international markets
in a statement to reuters petrobras said it would join the discussions by the regulator
the company said price formation based on market prices and more predictability may increase competition
suggestions about a new fuel pricing policy may be sent by consumers oil companies and state entities anp said
president michel temer ended the trucker protest by agreeing to cut diesel prices and change the frequency of price adjustments wiping out a third of the market cap of petrobras over fears of growing political interference
public anger has also been building over gasoline prices which have also recently risen and were not addressed by the agreement with the truckers
