finnish reactors meet preconditions for life extension -energy chief
oslo june reuters finland s two operating olkiluoto nuclear reactors appear to fulfil all basic preconditions to get a lifetime extension the director of the country s energy department told reuters on wednesday
the reactors licences expire by but riku huttunen s comments suggest they are set to stay in operation
the olkiluoto reactor which started operations in and olkiluoto commissioned two years later have a combined net output capacity of megawatts and account for around of finland s electricity needs
all basic preconditions seem to be fulfilled
the decision will be taken in early autumn most likely said huttunen who heads the energy department within finland s economy ministry
a final decision on the licence renewal will be made by the government he added
last week finland s radiation and nuclear safety authority stuk said it supported an application by the reactors owner teollisuuden voima tvo to extend their operating licences until
stuk said olkiluoto and met the safety and legal requirements that have been set for their lifetimes to be extended and approved the nuclear waste management procedures set out by tvo
it said however that tvo must test the ageing reactors pressure vessels once every eight years with the first pressure tests scheduled for and
tvo is anticipating the addition of a third unit in its olkiluoto site by
olkiluoto will be one of the world s largest reactors with a capacity of gigawatts
renewing the licences for the two older reactors and adding another could help finland reach its goal of reducing carbon emissions and getting rid of coal from power production by
the nordic country which depends largely on swedish and russian power imports saw industrial energy needs grow by percent last year while net power imports hit a record high
