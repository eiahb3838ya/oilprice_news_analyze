update 4-venezuela's pdvsa raises prospect of force majeure on oil exports -sources
reuters opec member venezuela has raised the prospect of declaring force majeure on contracts with major crude buyers amid plummeting output from its oil fields and tanker bottlenecks at ports according to three sources familiar with the matter
falling production from venezuela has contributed to a rally in global oil prices to a near high and other opec members may boost output at a meeting later this month to compensate for the shortfall and other risks to global supplies
oil is the financial lifeline for the embattled socialist government of president nicolas maduro but his administration has failed to invest enough in the industry to prevent its decline
venezuela s oil firm pdvsa has told some customers that they must send vessels equipped to accept oil transfers rather than load at its ports
if they do not accept the terms pdvsa is considering force majeure in essence declaring its contracts incapable of being fulfilled the sources familiar with the matter said
it has separately begun notifying all its customers that it will no longer receive new tankers for loading at jose or paraguana its main export terminals until ships already in line are served
most customers have so far refused the transfer request due to the lack of a third party supervising the operations according to shippers and traders
additional costs for completing the transfer also contributed to the refusals
pdvsa has been using sanctions imposed on the company by president donald trump as a rationale for the change according to one of the sources
venezuela s export terminals have grown overcrowded since oil firm conocophillips last month won court orders freezing pdvsa s key caribbean operations where the venezuelan company used to ship large cargoes to asian destinations
there were more than tankers off the coast of venezuela on tuesday according to thomson reuters vessel tracking data
we are going to try the idea first the source familiar with the matter said
many customers are going to prefer this than continuing to accumulate demurrage the source added referring to fees charged for long waiting times
one of pdvsa s indian customers confirmed it had received a request to load its cargoes via transfers
the buyer so far has refused to accept the new terms said an employee who was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity
traders and shippers were skeptical that the transfers would succeed in easing the bottlenecks
pdvsa will still have to load vessels at its jose port for transporting the crude to its proposed offshore loading facility and production declines are not expected to reverse
very large vessels that typically do not approach venezuela s western coast are now visible from paraguana refining center crp according to a worker from the facility
pdvsa did not reply to a request for comment
pdvsa knew it would fall short of contracted deliveries this year because of declining output and set a goal to limit the gap according to internal company documents reviewed by reuters
but the firm missed even that lowered target
there s an average deficit of barrels per day bpd between real and planned production so far this year according to one of the documents
in april the company shipped million bpd of crude and fuels to its customers bpd below the million bpd contracted the documents show
the firm shorted deliveries to of major customers with crude supply contracts the records show
the shortfall which has not been previously reported shed new light on the depth of the company s problems extracting and refining crude despite repeated promises by maduro and pdvsa president manuel quevedo to grow production by million bpd
the firm in april had so little oil it failed to deliver almost all of the crude it promised to its refining unit citgo petroleum under a contract the documents show
venezuela s exports of crude declined percent in the first four months of to million bpd compared with million bpd in the same period last year according to reuters trade flows data
in crude output fell to million bpd the lowest annual average in over three decades aggravating its export problems conoco last month started seizing pdvsa s terminals oil inventories and cargoes in the caribbean to enforce a billion arbitration award in a dispute over the socialist government s nationalisation of the oil producer s venezuela assets
