exclusive-italy's new government to review tap gas pipeline
rome reuters a plan to build the final stage of a billion international gas pipeline in italy is under review the country s new environment minister said calling the project pointless
italy is at the end of the southern gas corridor a pipeline taking gas from central asia to western europe
it is a cornerstone of the european union s energy security policy which aims to wean the bloc off russian gas supplies
environment minister sergio costa sworn in on friday as part of a ruling coalition of parties said italy s involvement in the trans adriatic pipeline tap the final stage of the corridor would be reviewed along with some other major projects
tap is on the table and we are looking at it as a priority said costa who was nominated as minister by the coalition s biggest party the movement
given our energy policy given falling gas demand that project today looks pointless he added in written responses to a series of questions put to him on tuesday and wednesday
a review would likely create tensions between italy and the developers of the billion euro billion tap project which include british oil group bp italy s snam and spain s enag√°s
it is unclear whether the minister s comments will translate into action
costa said any decision on tap s future would also involve other ministers
the also has more radical environmental policies than its coalition partner the league
the parties have said they will form a special committee to resolve any differences between them on the realisation and completion of public works of national significance
the league did not immediately respond to emailed requests for a comment
demand for gas in italy has risen in recent years but is still well below its peaks of a decade ago
costa made clear the review would focus on the underlying rationale for the tap project arriving in italy
that is in contrast to recent public debate which has focussed instead on its planned route through the country s southern puglia region
even puglia s governor has said it should be redirected away from a tourist area rather than scrapped
he has proposed an alternative route via a more industrial area of puglia
the new government s minister for southern italy barbara lezzi another member of also told reuters on wednesday that her party believed the pipeline represented an unnecessary environmental danger given italy s excess gas capacity
the tap consortium has said the pipeline away from italy is not an option and that redirecting it inside italy could delay the project by four to five years
the southern gas corridor already mostly completed snakes its way from azerbaijan through eastern europe towards italy
it would bring up to billion cubic metres of gas to italy from shah deniz a gas field developed by a consortium
the italian end is due to be completed by early and has already received national government approvals including environmental clearance in
costa said the review was consistent with the coalition s energy policy which was outlined in a published coalition accord signed by and league ahead of taking power
a published copy of the accord does not specifically mention the tap project but it says the coalition would accelerate italy s transition to renewable energy
the has said it wants to phase out fossil fuels by by ramping up renewable energy production
