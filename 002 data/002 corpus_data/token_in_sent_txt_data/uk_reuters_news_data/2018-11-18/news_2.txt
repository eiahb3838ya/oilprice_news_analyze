nigeria's buhari launches re-election bid with corruption still in focus
abuja nov reuters nigerian president muhammadu buhari launched his manifesto on sunday hoping his agenda can win him a second term at a election
buhari a military ruler in the early in became the first opposition candidate to oust a president through the ballot box
his focus on corruption may be offset by nigeria s slow growth
the country emerged from its first recession in a quarter of a century largely caused by low crude prices last year
in his first term buhari ordered government revenues and funds recovered in corruption investigations to be placed in a central bank account known as the treasury single account tsa
that had protected government coffers from corruption when oil receipts which make up of revenues were low he said
we are committed to deepening the work we started this first term such that the nation s assets and resources continue to be organised and utilised to do good for the common man he said at the manifesto launch
buhari said nigeria had a chance to make a break from its tainted past which favoured an opportunistic few
despite the president s focus on tackling corruption there have not been any significant convictions related to graft in his first term
the main opposition party has accused buhari of focusing on its members which the presidency denies
the campaign team of opposition candidate former vice president atiku abubakar said buhari s manifesto was an and did not address nigerians economic problems
if the state of the average nigerian has not improved in the last three and a half years more of the same is obviously not what they need it said in an emailed statement
abubakar is expected to unveil his policy plans on monday
the president set education as a policy priority vowing to overhaul buildings and subjects taught at schools in each year of the term and retrain teachers to focus on science technology and mathematics
he said there was scope for over million new jobs by expanding a nationwide vocational skills programme and improving access to credit for entrepreneurs and artisans
