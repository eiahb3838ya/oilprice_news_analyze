update 3-u.s. hits $1.1 billion texas oil pipeline with steel tariff
adds background on other energy companies by liz hampton july reuters a billion shale pipeline on monday was denied an exclusion to the trump administration s tariff on imported steel the first such ruling on a major energy project since the tariff went into effect
pipeline operator plains all american pipeline lp s request was denied because suitable product is available from domestic producers the commerce department ruling said
the trump administration this spring slapped a percent tariff on imported steel and percent on imported aluminum to safeguard jobs
it allowed companies to seek exemptions if metals were not available in sufficient quality quantity or in a reasonable time
several major energy companies including kinder morgan inc are awaiting rulings
shell and chevron corp so far have had mixed results on decisions related to their exclusion requests
plains said it will build its mile kilometres cactus ii line with steel from greece but called the rejection unjust because it had ordered steel last year prior to the tariff decision
plains did not say how much the tariffs would increase the project s cost
the steel tariff exclusion request review process is flawed and does not allow for an applicant to effectively engage said karen rugaard a plains spokeswoman
we are reviewing our options to challenge this reviews appear to rely on comments that are not required to be substantiated and on a review of undisclosed data by staff without meaningful interaction with the applicants rugaard added
on monday a commerce spokesman reported exclusion requests had been approved and denied
another of the submitted to date were rejected as improperly completed
plains is among major pipeline operators trying to address surging oil and gas production in west texas and new mexico that have filled existing lines
small producers in the region have said they may be forced to slow or new production over the lack of space
plains sought to use steel from a unit of corinth pipeworks pipe industry sa in greece for its cactus ii
the pipeline will have expanded capacity to transport barrels of oil per day from oilfields in west texas to export hubs along the gulf coast beginning next year
plains said in its application that only three steel mills in the world could produce the material required and none of those are in the united states
berg steel pipe corp in florida opposed the exclusion request saying it could supply product made with a different process than sought by plains
