reviving supersonic passenger flights to harm environment -study
reuters reviving supersonic passenger flights will harm the environment as the jets will not likely be able to comply with existing fuel efficiency pollution and noise standards for subsonic aircraft according to a study released on tuesday
based startups aerion supersonic boom supersonic and spike aerospace are all aiming to revive flights by the by modifying existing engines rather than spending billions of dollars to make a new one to serve a market that has been dormant since concorde stopped flying in
modified engines will burn times more fuel per passenger than subsonic jets exceed global limits for new subsonic jets by percent for nitrogen oxide and percent for carbon dioxide the international council on clean transportation icct said
the icct said based on its study supersonic jet makers would be unlikely to meet environmental standards unless they used a new engine design with technology like a variable cycle that would operate differently at than in cruise mode
the alternative is for policymakers to ease standards for supersonic jets the icct adds
the united states is already pushing for different standards for planes but facing resistance from european nations that want tough rules on noise
there are reasons to be worried about the environmental impact of reintroducing supersonic aircraft said daniel rutherford aviation director at the independent research organization
a modest first step is for manufacturers to commit to meeting existing standards for new aircraft added rutherford a of the icct study
but finding an efficient engine for supersonic jets is tough in an industry that has for decades been catering to subsonic planes by improving fuel efficiency expanding range and reducing noise through the use of larger fans
supersonic jets are most efficient at cruising altitude with smaller engines that are far noisier on takeoff like those on fighter jets or old that do not meet modern airport noise standards
smaller engines help reduce aerodynamic drag when flying above mach speed the speed of sound
lockheed martin corp aerion has selected a ge engine core used in fighter jets and boeing co as the basis for the engine on its planned jet which will have a top speed of mach
boom and spike which plan top speeds of mach and mach respectively have yet to select engines
even if you built something new i think you are going to be struggling said daniel an aerospace engineering lecturer at melbourne s monash university
i think that is why there is such a push in the united states to reconsider the standards particularly for supersonic aircraft because it is just going to be really reporting by jamie freed in singapore additional reporting by allison lampert in montreal editing by himani sarkar
