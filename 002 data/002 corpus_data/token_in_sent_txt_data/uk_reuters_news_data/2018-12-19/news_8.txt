bulgaria's energy company beh likely to appeal eu fine
sofia dec reuters bulgarian energy holding beh said on wednesday it would very likely appeal the hefty fine the european union antitrust regulators slapped on it for blocking rivals access to key gas infrastructure in bulgaria between and
the european commission fined beh million euros million on monday saying the company abused its market dominance to hinder competition
beh s gas supply unit bulgargaz and its gas network operator bulgartransgaz are also subject to the fine
beh and its units denied any wrongdoing and said they believed the access to the balkan country gas network and its gas storage facility had always been granted in line with the law
they also said the imposed fine was disproportionate
the companies will carefully look at the decision and will probably appeal it by challenging both the allegations and the amount of the fine beh said in a statement
beh said although the fine should be paid within three months in the case of an appeal it can either make a provisional payment of the fine or provide collateral
the bulgarian government says the european commission would have agreed to a settlement only if sofia sold a majority take in bulgatransgaz to a european strategic investor as a guarantee that market would not be distorted
bulgaria which still meets all of its gas needs through one route from one supplier russia s gazprom says such an option is unacceptable as its gas pipelines were strategic infrastructure
on the final line of the negotiations we proposed all kinds of options that should guarantee transparency and control including selling a minority stake deputy prime minister tomislav donchev told ministers
naturally from the government would seek an agreement for a majority stake sale he said in minutes from a cabinet meeting published by the government s press office
sofia plans to keep bulgargaz and bulgartransgaz as beh s units which is in line with eu energy rules
the country is working to diversify its gas routes and suppliers
it also wants to build a new pipeline that is likely to transport mainly russian gas from the turkstream pipeline to central europe bypassing ukraine
