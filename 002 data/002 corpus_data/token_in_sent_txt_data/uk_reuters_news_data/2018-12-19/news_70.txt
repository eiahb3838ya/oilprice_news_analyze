s.korea's 2018 lng imports to hit record high over 42 mln t
lng imports to hit record high of mln t data strong demand for power generation has boosted lng imports lng imports to be lower in on increased coal nuke power lng imports by jane chung seoul dec reuters south korea s imports of liquefied natural gas lng are set to reach an high over million tonnes in thanks to robust power generation demand but next year s shipments are likely to ebb on increased coal and nuclear power
south korea the world s lng importer after japan and china typically takes between million and million tonnes of lng a year mainly for heating power generation and cooking
this year a volume of million tonnes of lng is the expected intake up percent from million tonnes last year according to data from refinitiv eikon
that would top lng import levels of nearly million tonnes the country s customs data showed
that was the year south korea faced a series of nuclear reactor shutdowns due to a safety scandal over faulty parts which led to an increase in gas power generation
gas usage for power generation sharply rose this year because the country s nuclear utilization rate was the lowest so other power sources like gas had to fill the void said shin an analyst at ktb investment securities in seoul
in the six months of the year an average of almost half of the country s nuclear reactors were offline for planned maintenance according to reuters calculations based on data from korea hydro nuclear power as of now six reactors are shut down
south korea s nuclear utilization rates dropped to just percent for the first three quarters of the lowest rate ever according to the korea hydro nuclear power data
coal and nuclear together produce about percent of south korea s total electricity needs although the country is trying to lower its dependence on those two fuels to shift its energy policy towards cleaner and safer energy in the long term
this year gas power s share of the country s power supply mix outstripped electricity over according to calculations on data from korea electric power corp kepco
generation through october accounted for percent of electricity produced up from percent last year while nuclear made up percent down from percent
looking ahead south korea s lng demand growth for power generation is expected to hover around percent in down from nearly percent this year robbed of room to grow as more coal and nuclear power plants are still coming online despite the plans for a shift in policy according to a report by korea energy economic institute
we expect that lng imports next year will be lower than this year but will still exceed million tonnes said nicholas browne director of gas and lng at wood mackenzie
