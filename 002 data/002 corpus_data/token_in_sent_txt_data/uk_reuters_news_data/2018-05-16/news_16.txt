update 2-nigeria's parliament passes record 9.12 trln naira 2018 budget
nigeria is africa s biggest crude oil producer budget was first presented by buhari in spending plan must be signed into law by buhari nigeria to hold presidential election in adds quotes lower house passing by camillus eboh abuja may reuters nigeria s parliament passed a record trillion naira billion budget for on wednesday aimed at boosting growth in west africa s biggest economy nine months before the country s next presidential election
growth remains fragile after africa s top crude oil producer last year emerged from its first recession in years
the recession was largely caused by low crude prices and militant attacks on energy facilities since oil sales make up of government revenue
the total sum laid out in the spending plan passed by the senate is higher than the trillion naira budget presented to parliament by president muhammadu buhari in november
the budget was passed by the senate the upper chamber and by lawmakers in the lower house of representatives shortly afterwards
the budget still needs to be returned to buhari to be signed into law
we must grow our economy away from oil
hopefully the current budget when signed into law should help us in this regard said senate president bukola saraki
senate lawmakers said the increase from the plan presented by buhari six months ago was due to the assumed oil price rising to per barrel up from in buhari s earlier version
the budget assumes crude oil production of million barrels per day and an exchange rate of naira per dollar
brent crude stood at per barrel by gmt
we still consider the oil price benchmark to be rather conservative given this year s oil price outlook and would have preferred to see a steeper hike accompanied by lower borrowing said olalekan olabode an economist at lagos investment firm vetiva capital
the budget proposes the use of trillion naira to service debts and would operate a deficit of percent of gross domestic product this year
delays in passing budgets amid wrangling between the executive and legislature are common in nigeria and hindered the implementation of buhari s previous spending plans
buhari who took office in plans to seek a second term in next february s election
his handling the economy is likely to be a major campaign issue
budgets under buhari who took office in may have been nigeria s largest ever
but economists say implementation has been poor and failed to provide the type of capital expenditure needed to improve infrastructure
the implementation of fiscal policy is still weak and this year there is an additional risk of unproductive spending in the lead up to the election said cobus de hart a senior economist at south africa s nkc african economics
