update 1-iea warns global oil demand may suffer as crude nears $80
london reuters global demand for oil is likely to moderate this year as the price of crude nears a barrel and many key importing nations no longer offer consumers generous fuel subsidies the international energy agency said on wednesday
the iea cut its forecast for global demand growth to million barrels per day for from a previous estimate of million bpd
oil has risen percent in the last year driven by coordinated supply cuts and this month by concern over iranian supply after the united states said it would reimpose sanctions on tehran over its nuclear activities
it would be extraordinary if such a large jump did not affect demand growth especially as subsidies have been reduced or cut in several emerging economies in recent years the iea said
oil inventories in the world s richest nations the most transparent and easy to track have now fallen million barrels below the average the level targeted by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its partners as the group restrains crude output for a second year
for now the rapidly changing geopolitical landscape will move the attention away from stocks as producers and consumers consider how to limit volatility in the oil market the iea said
for its part the iea will monitor developments closely and is ready to act if necessary to ensure that markets remain well iran which produces around million bpd and is opec s supplier behind saudi arabia and iraq could face severe disruption to its exports
the iea said the previous round of sanctions which were lifted in early cut iran s crude exports by more than million bpd
it is too soon to say what will happen this time but we should examine whether other producers could step in to ensure an orderly flow of oil to the market and offset a disruption to iranian exports the agency said
iran exported million bpd of crude in april according to the oil ministry s news agency shana
the iea estimates demand for opec s crude will average million bpd for the rest of compared with output of million bpd in april

world supply meanwhile rose million bpd in april from a year earlier driven predominantly by production
economic crisis has driven venezuelan production to its lowest in years while natural decline in mexico cut production by bpd in april down percent the largest fall for any producer
record output from the united states pushed supplies up by million bpd to million bpd
production elsewhere outside opec was flat to lower the iea said noting declines in the north sea and brazil
the iea which advises western governments on energy policy expects supply to rise by million bpd in up from a previous forecast of million bpd
