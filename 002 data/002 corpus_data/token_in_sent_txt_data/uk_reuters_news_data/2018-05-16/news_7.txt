trump pick for u.s. state department energy job approved by senate panel
washington may reuters president donald trump s nominee for the top state department job dealing with matters related to energy and the global oil industry was approved by a senate committee on wednesday as the united states gears up to sanctions on iran s oil exports
the senate foreign relations committee approved francis fannon a former head of corporate affairs at mining company bhp billiton and senior director of murphy oil corp to head the department s energy bureau
if fannon is confirmed in a vote by the full senate one of his most immediate tasks as assistant secretary of state would be synthesizing reports from intelligence agencies with oil industry data to sanctions on iran s oil exports
trump announced on may he was withdrawing the united states from the iran deal which removed sanctions in exchange for the islamic republic curbing its nuclear program
fannon was approved by of the members of the panel with two democratic senators opposing him
one of the democrats senator bob menendez said fannon had lobbied against comprehensive climate change legislation and against limits on drilling in the gulf of mexico put in place after bp s deepwater horizon disaster that killed platform workers
energy security rests in energy diversification innovation and development of zero and low carbon energy sources menendez said at the hearing
the appointment of an oil and gas lobbyist to this position demonstrates a backwards outlook on energy before working in corporations fannon served as counsel to the senate environment committee and as an aide to two republican senators
in a hearing before the panel s vote fannon said that he had drafted provisions of the energy bill that helped unleash innovation and set the conditions for energy abundance today
