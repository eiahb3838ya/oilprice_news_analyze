update 1-bulgarian government prepares to revive belene nuclear project
sofia reuters the bulgarian government decided on wednesday to ask parliament to lift a ban on the development of the belene nuclear power plant as it gears up to attract foreign investors to revive the project
chinese state nuclear company cnnc has confirmed it is interested in the project which is on the danube river
energy minister temenuzhka petkova has said the balkan country plans to launch a tender by the end of the year to pick a strategic investor for the plant which is estimated to cost at least billion euros billion pounds
she has invited france s framatome majority controlled by edf to take part
the european investment bank has also said it would look into the project
bulgaria cancelled the project in after failing to find investors
the country also faced of pressure from the united states and the european union to limit its energy dependence on russia which was under contract to build the nuclear plant
bulgaria had to pay more than million euros to russia s rosatom for cancelling the project but also received nuclear parts for two megawatt reactors
as a result the country has to decide what to do with the equipment
sofia says it has already spent billion levs billion on belene which has a licensed site and equipment
but the government does not want to commit more public money extend state guarantees for a possible loan or sign any electricity supply deals for the plant
if there is no interest at the market there are two options for the project the sale of the equipment which can not be done under favourable conditions or the installation of one of the reactors at the kozloduy plant deputy prime minister tomislav donchev told a news conference
bulgaria already has two megawatt nuclear reactors at its kozloduy plant which at present provide about percent of the country s electricity
critics of the belene project say that the investment does not justify the benefits and that the project as been a source of corrupt practices for decades
martin vladimirov an analyst with the centre for the study of the democracy said belene was type of a zombie project that can not die because powerful lobbies are looking to cash in on lucrative procurement orders
