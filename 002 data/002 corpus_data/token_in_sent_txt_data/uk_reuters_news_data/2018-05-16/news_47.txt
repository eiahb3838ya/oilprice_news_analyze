updates to add graphics no change to text by ruma paul and oleg vukmanovic may reuters bangladesh has terminated talks with commodity trader trafigura to install a small floating liquefied natural gas lng import terminal due to delays in agreeing terms while rival trader gunvor advances with a separate project
once considered an energy backwater bangladesh s lng demand is set to hit million tonnes annually by after importing its first cargo last month and as traders target southeast asia s booming gas markets to boost sales
commodity traders trafigura vitol and gunvor were all pursuing lng import projects in bangladesh and smaller peer aot energy has provisionally agreed to supply the country with million tonnes annually for years
trafigura which also aims to build floating lng import terminals in pakistan and britain delayed agreeing terms to supply fertiliser producer chittagong urea fertilizer via a floating import facility on the karnaphuli river an official at a energy firm said
we are not going ahead with trafigura we can t wait for long for their response a director at energy firm petrobangla s lng division told reuters
trafigura declined to comment
by contrast rival trader gunvor is moving forward with plans to set up a floating storage and regasification unit fsru barge a stone s throw from trafigura s proposed project officials and industry sources said
gunvor partnered with belgium shipping firm exmar on its bangladesh venture which will supply the karnaphuli fertilizer company
exmar announced on monday it executed a charter with gunvor for its fsru barge for bangladesh
the barge built by china s wison offshore and marine is due to arrive in bangladesh in the this year and start operations after its full commissioning exmar said
a draft of a deal between gunvor and state officials was vetted by the law ministry and the government s purchase committee officials said
trader vitol meanwhile is pushing to develop a fsru alongside the ageing sangu gas platform in the bay of bengal after beating international oil companies including exxon mobil to the contract
a provisional deal under which aot energy will supply bangladesh with lng for years is also moving closer to reality
in march a senior petrobangla official travelled to switzerland to verify aot energy s financial strength after senior executives left the trading firm amid a shrinking credit line and losses in some trading operations
as a result of that meeting petrbangla is working on a final draft of a deal with aot officials there said
bangladesh secured more competitive lng pricing with aot compared to its contract with qatar officials said
under its million tonnes per annum deal with qatar bangladesh agreed to pay percent of the average price of brent oil plus a constant of per mmbtu
bangladesh also has a lng import deal with oman trading international for million tonnes annually
that lng will be priced at percent of the average price of brent plus a per mmbtu constant
