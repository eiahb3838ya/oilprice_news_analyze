update 1-eu leaders struggle to save iran economic ties from us sanctions
sofia reuters european union leaders agreed on wednesday to try to keep the iran nuclear deal alive and maintain their reviving economic cooperation with tehran after president donald trump withdrew from the pact
but the eu leaders did not make any quick decisions during their first meeting on the matter since trump quit the accord earlier this month highlighting how clout in international trade and finance limits the europeans scope for action
that was quickly brought home by the french energy giant total which joined other european companies in signaling on wednesday they could exit iran
as long as iran respects the provisions of the deal the eu will also respect it said donald tusk president of the european council and chairman of the leaders gathering in the bulgarian capital sofia
the leaders of britain france and germany briefed their peers
the three countries were eu signatories of the deal that gave iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear program but which trump dismissed as the worst deal the head of the bloc s executive juncker of the european commission has also presented options the leaders have to shield european investments in iran and the slowly reviving economic cooperation which many eu states hope to benefit from
an eu source said after the talks the leaders agreed to start work to protect european companies negatively affected by the options include allowing the european investment bank to invest there and coordinating credit lines from eu states
foreign ministers of germany france and britain met their iranian counterpart in brussels on tuesday and tasked their experts to come up with measures for a meeting of their deputies in vienna next week
but a senior eu official admitted there was no solution and that it would take some time for the bloc to come up with what would be a complex mix of national and joint steps
the eu s top energy and climate official commissioner miguel arias canete is heading to iran on may for talks on energy cooperation a symbolic gesture from the eu that it wants to stay engaged despite the withdrawal
in his criticism of the accord which the other signatories russia and china also want to uphold trump has said it did not go far enough in restraining iran s ability to develop nuclear weapons while not addressing its missile program and involvement in various conflicts in the middle east
eu leaders agreed on wednesday to keep on looking into these issues but their previous efforts have not convinced trump
as the eu scrambles to salvage an accord they see as a key element of international security and a diplomatic success they also wonder about their ties with washington
tusk s unusually biting criticism of trump on wednesday highlighted the deep split looking at the latest decisions of president trump someone could even think with friends like that who needs enemies reporting by gabriela baczynska editing by william maclean and cynthia osterman
