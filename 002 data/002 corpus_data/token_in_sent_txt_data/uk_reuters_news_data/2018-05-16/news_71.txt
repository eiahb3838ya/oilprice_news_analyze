the views expressed are his own chart by john kemp london may reuters net petroleum imports have fallen to the lowest level in more than half a century as a result of the shale revolution which is profoundly changing the impact higher oil prices have on the economy
since the the united states has been the world s largest producer and consumer of oil which means it has a complicated relationship with oil prices
rising oil prices benefit some businesses and workers at the expense of others and the same has been true about a sharp price fall
until after world war two the country was a net exporter to the rest of the world the first era of energy dominance
but from the late and especially the the united states turned into an increasingly major oil importer
since then the principal effect of a rise in oil prices has been to transfer income from consumers and businesses in the united states to countries in latin america the middle east and africa
rising prices have put pressure on the balance of payments and the dollar s value contributing to an occasionally negative relationship between the price of oil and the exchange rate
but as net imports have declined in the last decade the picture has changed again and the main transfers of income are now occurring within the united states rather than with the rest of the world
the impact of oil prices on the trade deficit and the exchange rate is becoming much less significant than before
instead rising prices are transferring income from net consuming states such as california florida new york and illinois to net producing states including texas oklahoma new mexico and north dakota
rising prices are also transferring income from households motorists the transportation sector manufacturers and retailers to the oil industry and its supply chain
in the broadest sense rising oil prices tend to depress spending by consumers while enhancing investment by the oil industry how rising oil prices will affect the united states barron s may
in the short term rising oil prices have provided a significant boost to the economic expansion as the positive impact on investment has outweighed the negative impact on consumer spending
but that positive scenario may not last if oil prices continue to rise over the next two years
domestic crude production has more than doubled from an average of million barrels per day bpd in to million bpd in february
government policies have also cut import dependence by requiring increases in vehicle fuel economy and mandating the addition of ethanol and biodiesel to the fuel supply
domestic consumption of petroleum products peaked at million bpd in and was averaging million bpd in
the result has been a transformation in petroleum trade with the country becoming an increasingly important exporter of refined products such as diesel and more recently crude oil
the size and suddenness of this shift is one reason why the rise of shale production in the united states qualifies as a genuine energy revolution
net imports of crude oil and petroleum products peaked at more than million bpd in according to the energy information administration
by net imports had fallen to million bpd and they continued to shrink in the first three months of
the united states remains an important net importer of crude roughly million bpd in recent months but has become an important net exporter of refined products million bpd
the balance of payments is now much more insulated from the impact of changing oil prices than during the oil shock
between january and march the trade deficit with the rest of the world worsened by almost billion compared with a year earlier
the components of the deficit worsened by billion but the petroleum deficit actually improved by almost billion international trade in goods and services census bureau may
the rise in oil production has encouraged some policymakers to speak about achieving energy independence or even a second era of energy dominance
the reality is more complicated
increased domestic energy production is clearly beneficial for the economy
but sharp increases or reductions in oil prices can still have profound distributional effects within the united states
since capital and labour do not move without friction between industries and states sudden income redistribution can still have an adverse impact on the overall performance of the economy
the oil slump between and deepened the overall slowdown in business investment and contributed to a soft patch in overall economic growth which initially overshadowed the gains for consumers
the rise in prices since is now contributing to an acceleration of business investment and activity in the oil and gas sector and all along the supply chain helping boost the overall economic expansion
mining which includes oil and gas production was the sector of the economy in gross domestic product by industry fourth quarter and annual bureau of economic analysis april
rising oil prices are one reason the economies of some major states outperformed the rest of the country towards the end of
texas was the state economy in the country in the final three months of gross domestic product by state fourth quarter and annual bureau of economic analysis may
but beyond a certain point rising oil prices will start to weigh on investment and spending by the sector and households retarding overall growth
moreover the united states remains embedded in a dense web of international trading relationships with petroleum producing and consuming countries
higher oil prices tend to improve the opportunities for exports and outward investment in countries in the middle east and other regions
but they also tend to curb export growth to countries notably china india japan and in europe which include some of the country s most important trading partners
