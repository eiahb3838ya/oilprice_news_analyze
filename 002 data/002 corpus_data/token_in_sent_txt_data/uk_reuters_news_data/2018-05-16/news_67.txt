update 5-conocophillips 'not close' to recouping $2 bln from pdvsa -ceo
houston reuters oil producer conocophillips is far from collecting the full value of a billion billion pounds arbitration award against venezuelan state oil company pdvsa conoco s chief executive said on tuesday
conoco has won court orders allowing the company to begin seizing pdvsa assets in efforts to collect on an award by the international chamber of commerce icc over the nationalisation of its projects in venezuela
while conoco started seizing assets this month chief executive officer ryan lance is telegraphing that the company intends to escalate its campaign against pdvsa across the globe as it works to recoup losses
that threatens to further limit revenue at the firm the single largest moneymaker for the opec member
it s not close to the billion today but over time we expect to be able to recover it lance said at conoco s annual shareholder meeting in houston
we re just trying to look where all the assets conoco has filed with courts in the united states hong kong the united kingdom and throughout the caribbean in an attempt to begin the legal process of seizing additional pdvsa assets lance said
conoco on tuesday moved to seize at least two cargoes of crude and fuel near a terminal operated by pdvsa subsidiary citgo petroleum in aruba sources told reuters
in asia pdvsa is with petrochina of cv shipping pte ltd a tanker operator according to cv shipping s website
the joint venture has four tankers each capable of transporting million barrels of oil
in europe pdvsa is a with finland s neste corp of ab nynas petroleum according to pdvsa s website
the joint venture which processes about barrels of crude per day operates two united kingdom refineries
conoco has had early success in asset seizures in some dutch regions of the caribbean due to specific legal statutes though other jurisdictions are expected to take longer lance said
the moves have disrupted fuel deliveries throughout the caribbean much of which depend on pdvsa
aruba s prime minister evelyn told journalists on tuesday that the situation with conoco in the caribbean is worrisome
we re trying to minimize any impact that this might have on the islands in the caribbean lance said
we are concerned about putting them in the middle of this thing between pdvsa and three curacao utilities said on tuesday they were filing suit in a local court to determine the responsibility of the local isla refinery operated by pdvsa to meet fuel supply contracts following conoco s efforts to attach assets there
the utilities which include power and water company aqualectra and fuel distributor curoil said a lack of fuel could have a severe impact on their operations and therefore on the local population
pdvsa which operates isla has stopped sending crude shipments on concern they could be attached
conoco has two other outstanding arbitration awards against pdvsa
