rpt analysis-for big oil, reserve size matters less than ever
adds analysis tag oil and gas reserves life falls below years reserves life lowest in at least years companies focusing more on quality of reserves graphic oil majors reserves life sector by ron bousso london may reuters a decade ago the news that the world s top oil and gas companies had less than years of production left in their reserves might have caused a panicked in their shares
but as consumers try to move away from fossil fuels to cleaner and cheaper energy sources investors and executives say reserve size is no longer the gold standard for measuring the value and health of a company
the cost of developing existing reserves and the amount of carbon those reserves produce has now become more important they say
this is leading to a profound shift in company strategies
the quality of reserves and the commercial viability of reserves has eclipsed the quantity of reserves by far in recent years said adi karev global leader for oil and gas at ey
the sector is emerging from one of its longest and deepest downturns after an oil price slump that started in
the largest oil companies exxon mobil royal dutch shell chevron conocophillips france s total bp equinor formerly statoil and italy s eni have adapted
they saved money by cutting jobs and increasing technology spending and now make more money with oil at a barrel than they did at
but they also cut spending on exploration for new resources and development of new fields
this led to a decline in reserves
an analysis by reuters and guinness asset management of the annual reports of those eight companies shows that the size of their oil and gas reserves when added together fell to billion barrels in
that was the lowest since the same amount in
the reserves of exxon mobil the largest company shrank by percent since the slump began in
shell s reserves fell percent since then despite the billion acquisition of bg group in
bp and chevron s oil and gas reserves increased by a small percent since
eni was the only one to significantly boost its reserves by over percent thanks to the discovery of the giant zohr gas field off the coast of egypt
the cumulative reserve life the number of years a company can sustain its current production levels with existing reserves of the eight companies fell to years in
that was the lowest level in at least years although that drop is also the result of a sharp increase in production
reuters does have access to data going back beyond
exxon s reserves life shrank from years in to in
eni s from to years despite its discoveries
shell slipped from to years over the period
there is clear deterioration in reserves and this will be a problem in time according to jonathan waghorn manager of the energy fund at guinness asset management
but for now year s reserve life should be fine so it is not a materially important component between the with electric vehicles on the ascent and a peak for fuel demand on the horizon the focus on the reserves is shifting to the quality of the reserves rather than the quantity some reserves are more efficient than others eldar saetre chief executive officer of norwegian oil giant equinor told reuters
at some point we see a shrinking oil and gas industry when that will be i do not know but then it is really important that the best barrels come in and that will be increasingly a competitive some companies are already changing strategies to adapt to the new focus
oil prices are not expected to rise sharply in the and governments are seeking to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions
this means firms are adjusting by setting ceilings for the cost of projects often below a barrel
oil reached a a barrel this month the highest since late
crude oil and natural gas have different grades and the cost of pumping them can vary hugely
saudi arabia s oil is easier and therefore cheaper to extract than angola s complex deepwater wells
canada s oil sands have become less attractive due to their high cost of extraction and high carbon intensity
exxon wrote down a large part of its canadian oil reserves in
its largest rival shell has sold most of its canadian assets in recent years
north american shale which has emerged over the past decade can be developed relatively quickly and at low cost in contrast to dollar deepwater projects that take years to develop
the permian basin in texas the heartland of the shale oil boom in recent years saw production costs drop sharply to as low as a barrel
exxon and rival chevron have both acquired large acreage in the permian in recent years
shell is also expanding in shale
the gulf of mexico also has low extraction costs because it has large reservoirs of oil and some infrastructure is already located there such as services companies and onshore bases
statoil and total have bought exploration acreage in the gulf of mexico in recent months
brazil s reserves also have low costs as there are huge reservoirs and also some existing infrastructure
all eight companies are there and several have recently sharply increased their production in the basin
we are now getting to the point that the focus on efficiencies and producing reserves at a low level is what investors expect karev said
