britain's strategy to meet climate change targets not sufficient -lawmakers
london reuters the british government s clean growth strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will not be enough to meet legally binding climate change targets a committee of lawmakers said on wednesday
the strategy launched last year outlines investment in research and innovation to help reduce emissions which lead to global warming
britain has committed to cut emissions by percent by compared to levels and must produce proposals on how to reach its climate targets as part of carbon budgets set every five years
although the amount of electricity generated from energy doubled to a record percent last year from there are signs that investment might have stalled in the past two years the environmental audit committee said in a report
annual clean energy investment in britain is now at its lowest level since threatening the country s ability to meet its carbon budgets from
the report also said that changes to energy policies in has undermined investor confidence and reduced the number of renewable energy projects in development
added to that disruption from the privatisation of the green investment bank which was set up by the government in to spur private investment in green projects but sold to a consortium led by macquarie bank last year and a reduction in european investment bank lending following a vote to leave the eu might also have contributed to the dip in clean energy investment
the government must urgently plug this policy gap and publish its plan to secure the investment required to meet the uk s climate change targets said mary creagh chair of the environmental audit committee
it should provide greater clarity on how it intends to deliver the clean growth strategy by the budget and explore how a sovereign green bond could kickstart its clean growth strategy she added
