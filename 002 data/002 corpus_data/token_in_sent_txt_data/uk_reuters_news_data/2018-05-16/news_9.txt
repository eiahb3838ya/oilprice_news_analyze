portugal environment body oks oil well off alentejo coast
lisbon reuters portugal s environmental agency gave its tacit approval on wednesday to a consortium of galp energia and italy s eni to drill an oil exploration well off the alentejo region s coast a project that environmental activists are trying to block
it would mark the resumption of drilling in portugal after a long hiatus with opponents arguing the risks outweigh the chances of finding any significant quantities of oil
the agency said it had not identified any potentially significant negative effects on the environment from the planned well and would not order a specific study which opponents of the project have been demanding
various local municipalities politicians and activists have filed lawsuits and petitions to try and block oil exploration off the vicentine coast in alentejo which boasts beautiful beaches and a large natural park
several oil companies spudded a few dozen exploration wells in portugal in the century but all were either dry or showed just traces of hydrocarbons
drilling activity petered out in the early although seismic studies have continued
portugal s galp and its partner at the time brazil s petrobras won an exploration licence in for three blocks in the alentejo basin
eni bought petrobras share in the blocks in
the consortium hopes to drill the well in the last quarter of after the government last january extended the exploration period for a year
the expresso newspaper said last month an internal study by the consortium pointed to potential oil reserves of up to billion barrels in the area but the companies would not publicly confirm such estimates saying only they expected to find hydrocarbons based on seismic studies
climate action network can europe last month named portugal the winner of its european fossil fuel subsidies for handing out the drilling licence near its protected biodiversity area and a tourism hotspot and wasting taxpayers money on supporting dirty energy
