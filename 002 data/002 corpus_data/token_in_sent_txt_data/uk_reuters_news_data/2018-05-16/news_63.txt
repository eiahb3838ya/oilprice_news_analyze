interview-mexico's pemex says testing crude for import could start in july
seattle may reuters mexican oil company pemex expects to begin testing light crudes as soon as july for possible import looking to boost margins at its domestic refineries its chief executive said on tuesday
pemex has for decades exported crude oil but has hardly ever imported the commodity preferring to process domestic crudes at its six refineries in mexico
pemex chief executive officer carlos trevino said the company would likely seek imports resembling its proprietary isthmus grade of light crude the production of which has been declining in mexico
we are going to start testing maybe in the third quarter trevino told reuters on the sidelines of a conference in seattle
we are going to be looking for the cheaper mix we may be using the west texas intermediate something from the he said
what i personally expect is that we can find something very similar to isthmus the company one of the largest in latin america has said it was looking for lighter crude grades for its refining network which is currently operating at around percent of its million capacity
trevino reiterated that importing could be a temporary strategy partly because of the oil it has been producing at its new ixachi field in veracruz
it s a lot of gas and very very light crude so we expect to get more oil from that field so maybe that will help us on the mix we are using for our refineries he said
trevino also said pemex s annual crude oil hedging program is set to cover about a third of annual production at a price of per barrel but he declined to elaborate
the company was processing between bpd as of sunday but expects to process an average bpd for the rest of the year
pemex has increased processing levels at its madero refinery and expects to finish the starting up of its minatitlan facility this month trevino said
it may begin maintenance at its cadereyta and tula refineries later this year
we are going to be processing around bpd at the end of the year he added
trevino also said he expects pemex s rate of replacement for its proven oil reserves in to be pretty much the same or a little above the rate it achieved in
