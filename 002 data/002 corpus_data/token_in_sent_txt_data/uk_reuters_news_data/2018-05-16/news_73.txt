update 3-conoco aims to seize oil cargoes near citgo's aruba terminal
adds details on tanker cargoes seized by sailu urribarri and marianna parraga may reuters oil company conocophillips has brought new court actions to seize two cargoes of crude and fuel near a terminal operated by pdvsa subsidiary citgo petroleum in aruba the aruban government confirmed on tuesday
conoco is moving aggressively to enforce a billion arbitration award over the expropriation of two oil projects in venezuela creating unease in the caribbean where many islands depend on fuel produced by pdvsa
the aruba refinery has said that an embargo on two citgo oil cargoes was introduced last night
citgo is claiming the crude as its own and is fighting at court to demonstrate the product is not pdvsa s said prime minister evelyn in a statement
independent of any outcome this is not going to affect aruba she said
the cargoes seized included barrels of crude oil on the grimstad and about barrels of jet fuel gasoline and diesel on the atlantic lily according to a source at the aruba terminal and thomson reuters vessel tracking data
citgo the refining unit of pdvsa has leased the bpd aruba refinery and its terminal from the government since to store venezuelan and other crudes for supplying its refineries
as the refinery remains idled since while a major refurbish project is underway citgo regularly supplies the island with imported fuel
told journalists government officials and the management of the refinery were organizing a contingency plan to avoid a situation similar to curacao and bonaire where inventories were blocked by conoco s legal actions
no fuel shortages have been reported in the caribbean but officials are trying to import from other sources
conoco in recent days seized the bopec oil terminal owned by pdvsa in bonaire and fuel inventories at the isla refinery operated by the venezuelan firm in curacao
both islands are in talks with conoco to free fuel for domestic consumption
what belongs to citgo belongs to pdvsa but a judge has to rule on it said
daren beaudo a conoco spokesman said on tuesday that the company sent representatives to the caribbean this week to meet with local officials and address their concerns over conoco s efforts to enforce the arbitration award by the international chamber of commerce icc
pdvsa did not immediately respond to a request for comment
last week curacao officials said the isla refinery would have to halt refining operations once its available inventories were exhausted
it is pdvsa that has failed to honor our award by ignoring the judgement of the icc tribunal and other local court orders beaudo said in a statement
conoco chief executive ryan lance on tuesday said the firm is far from recovering all of the billion icc award
he said legal actions have been brought in hong kong and london to have the ruling recognized following a similar move last month in a new york court
