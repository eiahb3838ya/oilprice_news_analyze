update 1-opec sees oil rally towards $80 as short-term spike, not supply-driven
reuters opec sees oil s rally towards a barrel as a spike driven by geopolitics rather than any supply shortage four opec delegates said a sign the group is not rushing yet to rethink its agreement
the view of top exporter saudi arabia is that any brief jump in oil prices is not sufficient grounds for producers to boost output an opec source familiar with the kingdom s thinking said
for such a decision to occur the rally would need to be driven by data pointing to a supply impact the source said
the four opec delegates said the latest rise in prices stemmed more from concern about sanctions on iran and tension in the middle east rather than a suddenly tighter balance between oil supply and demand
prices are high just because of the tensions one of the opec delegates who declined to be identified said
since last year oil has been supported by a deal by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries plus russia and other to cut output
prices have risen about percent since the accord began in january
global benchmark brent crude on tuesday hit the highest since november before easing below on wednesday and settling at a barrel
prices could rally further before declining according to some in opec
it may exceed and then go down one of the sources said
in any case the extent of the rally has yet to cause any real concern
not yet said another delegate asked whether oil at was too high
president donald trump last month accused opec of artificially boosting prices putting pressure on producers to cool the market and in turn drawing a rebuke from some opec members
opec and its allies are cutting production by about million barrels per day almost percent of world supply until the end of
oil ministers meet on june to review the policy
the producers original goal was to reduce oil inventories to the average
while this has largely been achieved ministers have said other metrics should be considered such as oil industry investment suggesting they are in no hurry yet to wind down supply cuts
nonetheless delegates pointed to growing concern about a decline in venezuelan output due to economic crisis which officials had downplayed when inventories were higher
opec has on the supply cut due in part to lower venezuelan supply
opec has no official target price for oil
saudi arabia has emerged over the past year as opec s leading supporter of measures to boost prices however a change from riyadh s previous more moderate stance
the kingdom keen to fund economic reforms would be happy to see crude rise to or even industry sources told reuters last month
iran once a keen opec price hawk now wants lower prices than saudi arabia and has said exporters should aim for crude around to contain shale oil growth
when oil prices rise due to geopolitical concern and not due to demand and supply and fundamentals it can not be reasonable a source familiar with iranian thinking said of the current rally
