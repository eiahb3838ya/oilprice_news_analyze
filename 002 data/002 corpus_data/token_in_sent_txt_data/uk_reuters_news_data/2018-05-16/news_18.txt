bunge cuts biodiesel output in german refinery
hamburg reuters agribusiness group bunge said on wednesday it was reducing biodiesel output at a german refinery the latest in a series of production cuts in germany following a surge of cheap imports of the green fuel into europe
bunge expects to initially cut output at its mannheim biodiesel plant by percent in the second quarter of a bunge spokeswoman said
the plant has capacity to produce tonnes of biodiesel annually
afterwards we will review production periodically and adjust as necessary the spokeswoman said
the production cut is another sign of problems in europe s biofuel industry after the eu in march removed duties on biodiesel imports argentine and indonesian producers following the end of legal proceedings at the european court of justice
the eu s removal of duties on biodiesel from argentina and indonesia created a surge in eu imports forcing european producers to cut production in coming months
eu producers say biodiesel from argentina and indonesia gets unfair state support enabling it to be sold at low prices in europe
agribusiness group archer daniels midland co said in march it would suspend production at a major biodiesel plant in germany because of increasing cheap imports
in april german renewable fuel producer natural energy west said it was reducing biodiesel output by percent because of surging imports from argentina and indonesia
