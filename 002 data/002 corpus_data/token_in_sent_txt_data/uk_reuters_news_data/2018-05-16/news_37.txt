iran agrees to build new refinery for sri lanka -govt spokesman
colombo may reuters iran has agreed to build a new oil refinery for sri lanka in addition to upgrading its ageing barrel per day bpd refinery sri lankan cabinet spokesman rajitha senaratne said on wednesday
iranian officials pledged the new refinery when sri lanka president maithripala sirisena made an official visit to tehran over the weekend the first leader to go to iran since president donald trump reimposed economic sanctions
they even agreed to help sri lanka to build a new refinery senaratne told reuters when asked if sri lanka sought assistance to refurbish its current refinery
we only spoke about the concepts and they promised to send a team for further talks senaratne did not elaborate how the sri lankan government would deal with iranian financial transactions in the face of sanctions
sri lanka has a single bpd oil refinery in colombo suburb sapugaskanda built by iran in to refine iranian light crude
however when toughened sanctions were imposed on tehran in to curb its nuclear ambitions ceylon petroleum corporation cpc was forced to look for other light crudes
the existing refinery accounts for percent of sri lanka s fuel requirement but the head of cpc last week said that upgrading may not be the solution because sri lanka needs a refinery capable of handling all types of crude
iran s offer comes as chinese middle east and russian companies are in preliminary discussions to build a bpd refinery for cpc
two chinese companies have jointly bid for a bpd refinery with annual output of about million tonnes a year in the southern town of hambantota where china controls a sea port and plans an industrial zone
sri lanka is still in talks about the hambantota refinery though the government has blocked a proposal by the chinese companies to sell fuel locally
sri lanka has also discussed another bpd refinery in partnership with indian oil corp but there has been no progress on that plan
