update 3-france's total to quit iran gas project if no sanctions waiver
paris reuters total will pull out of a gas project in iran if it can not secure a waiver from sanctions the french energy company said on wednesday
companies are starting to take matters into their own hands as european and some other governments struggle to save an international nuclear deal with iran after the united states withdrew and said it would reinstate sanctions on tehran
determined to keep the accord alive european leaders need to find a way to assure companies that their investments are beyond washington s reach
they also want to persuade tehran the deal which lifted earlier sanctions on the islamic republic in exchange for it curbing its nuclear ambitions is worth sticking to
total signed a contract in to develop phase of iran s south pars field with an initial investment of billion million a contract tehran repeatedly hailed as a symbol of the accord s success
total will not continue the south pars project and will have to unwind all related operations before november unless total is granted a specific project waiver by authorities with the support of the french and european authorities the french oil and gas major said in a statement
total s announcement comes after german insurer allianz and danish oil product tanker operator maersk tankers said they were winding down their businesses in iran
joe kaeser the ceo of germany s siemens told cnn his company would not be able to do any new business with tehran
iran has said it may start enriching uranium again if it can no longer see any economic benefit to the deal
total said any waiver would need to include protection from secondary sanctions that washington might impose on companies that continue to do business with iran
these might include the loss of financing in dollars by banks the loss of shareholders and the inability to continue its operations it said
france germany and britain are leading a european effort to safeguard europe s economic interests but have few options that pose any threat to the united states
it would be suicide to do any new business or funding for iran or companies without explicit guarantees from the government
they have us by the throat because so much business is conducted and cleared in dollars one european investment banker said
the fines are in the multibillions these days so it s just not worth the risk for a small piece of business and maybe pleasing a european an official in the french finance ministry said precise requests were being lodged with the authorities including for total and that the company s decision was not a surprise
a european diplomat was more blunt we have a situation where there is a will to impose sanctions on europeans and a resentment towards european companies who are now being accused of supporting a terrorist state
with that in mind it s a logical total said it had so far spent less than million euros million on the project and withdrawing would not impact the company s production growth targets
iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said the french firm would not pay a penalty if it pulled out of the project
italy s eni which last june signed a provisional agreement with tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies said after washington s decision to quit the nuclear deal last week that it had no plans for new projects in iran
in an unintended twist president donald trump s decision to threaten european companies that continue to invest in iran may open the door to chinese rivals
industry sources told reuters this week that china s cnpc which holds a percent stake in the south pars project was ready to take over total s majority stake in the project if it pulled out
