update 3-rouhani says iran to continue oil exports and resist u.s. economic war
reuters iran will continue to export oil despite sanctions which are part of a psychological war doomed to failure iranian president hassan rouhani said on monday
by reimposing sanctions on opec s third biggest crude producer washington wants to force tehran to drop its ballistic missile programs further curb its nuclear work and limit its support for proxy militias from syria to lebanon and yemen
we will not yield to this pressure which is part of the psychological war launched against iran rouhani said in a speech in the city of khoy broadcast live on state television
they have failed to stop our oil exports
we will keep exporting it
your regional policies have failed and you blame iran for that failure from afghanistan to yemen and syria he added to chants of death to america
rouhani said washington lacked the necessary international support for its sanctions and noted that it had granted temporary waivers to eight major buyers of iranian oil
america is isolated now
iran is supported by many countries
except for the zionist regime israel and some countries in the region no other country backs america s pressure on iran he said
the european union france germany britain russia and china participants with the united states in the deal that lifted sanctions on iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program have been trying to find ways to circumvent the limitations
in particular the eu has been trying to establish a special purpose vehicle spv for trade with iran
but this has not stopped foreign businesses ranging from oil companies and trading houses to firms leaving iran for fear of incurring penalties
iran has threatened to exit the deal if its economic benefits are not preserved but foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi told a news conference that it remained hopeful that the europeans can save the deal
the spv was conceived as a clearing house that could be used to help match iranian oil and gas exports against purchases of eu goods circumventing the sanctions which are based on the global use of the dollar for oil trade
the eu wanted to have the spv set up by this month but no country has offered to host it six diplomats told reuters last week
we expect eu to implement the spv as soon as possible qasemi said
iran adheres to its commitments as long as other signatories honor iran s deputy oil minister amirhossein zamaninia said france might host the spv the fars news agency reported on monday
the french foreign ministry declined to comment
the finance ministry has said that all options are on the table for the spv and that no decisions had been taken
washington has warned that european banks and firms who engage in the spv will be at risk from the reimposed sanctions
