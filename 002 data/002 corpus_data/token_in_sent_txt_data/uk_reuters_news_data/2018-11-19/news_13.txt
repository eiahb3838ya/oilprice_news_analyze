the unexpected resurgence in iranian oil imports due to the waivers has helped push spot prices for middle east crude and condensate to their lowest in more than a year

iran is also trying not to sell it cheaper
we won t import iran oil until perhaps after the sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter

started in to counter sanctions on iranian oil japan s sovereign insurance scheme covers any shortfalls from protection indemnity p i insurance for ships carrying crude from iran to japan
the japanese government has declined to give information on the volumes of iranian imports that would be allowed under the exemption period
some sources said the sanctions waiver may allow japan to buy around barrels per day bpd of iranian oil
that marks a significant reduction for buyers that took about bpd of iranian oil in
