refile-uae fully complying with u.s. sanctions on iran -official
dubai reuters the united arab emirates is fully complying with sanctions imposed this month by the united states on iran even though it will mean a further drop in trade with tehran a uae economy ministry official told reuters on monday
abu dhabi the political capital of the uae federation has taken a hawkish stand on tehran although dubai the country s business hub has traditionally been a major trading partner with iran
washington announced on a series of sanctions targeting iran s banks shipping sector national airline and individuals after president donald trump pulled the united states out of an international nuclear deal with tehran
we are implementing the sanctions abdullah undersecretary for foreign trade and industry said in an interview in dubai
the uae is enforcing the sanction regime as it is published by the united states said adding that the relevant authorities would ensure compliance
said the uae s trade with iran is expected to decline this year and next year due to the sanctions after falling to billion in from a peak of billion in
most trade consists of via dubai to iran which lies across the gulf
the sanctions are part of a wider effort by the trump administration to diminish iranian influence in the middle east
the uae is among allies in the gulf region that staunchly oppose iranian foreign policy and swiftly backed washington s decision
it is also a member of a coalition that is opposing the houthi group in yemen s civil war
compliance will mean uae companies do not face difficulties in the united states and the uae government will look to boost trade with other markets such as africa and asia to offset the impact of the sanctions on its own economy said repeating an existing government policy to diversify trade
trump s administration has threatened those who continue to do iran business with the prospect of losing access to the market although it has given temporary exemptions to eight importing countries to keep buying iranian oil
the european union france germany and britain which are trying to save the nuclear deal have said they regret the decision and will seek to protect european companies doing legitimate business with tehran
