update 3-saudi king urges action against iran, backs yemen peace
riyadh reuters saudi arabia s king salman urged the international community on monday to halt iran s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and reiterated the kingdom s support for efforts to end the war in yemen
the king s annual remarks to the shura council a top governmental advisory body were his first public comments since the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul on which caused a global outcry
king salman who did not mention the khashoggi affair condemned the actions of iran its rival for influence in the region including in the conflicts in syria iraq and yemen
the iranian regime has always intervened in the internal affairs of other countries sponsored terrorism created chaos and devastation in many countries in the region the monarch said
the international community has to work to put an end to the iranian nuclear programme and stop its activities that threaten security and the king said riyadh supported efforts to end the conflict in yemen where a coalition has been battling houthi rebels for nearly four years to restore the government
our standing by yemen was not an option but a duty to support the yemeni people in confronting the aggression of militias he said
the houthis said on monday they were halting drone and missile attacks on saudi arabia the united arab emirates and their yemeni allies and indicated readiness for a broader ceasefire if the coalition wants peace
riyadh has come under growing international criticism for its conduct of the yemen war which has brought the country to the brink of famine and killed many civilians in air strikes
the reputation of saudi arabia the world s top oil exporter has been further battered by khashoggi s murder
the king had largely stepped back from active political life and handed extensive authority to his son and heir apparent crown prince mohammed bin salman but is now trying to defuse the crisis caused by the murder and shore up the crown prince
prince mohammed the kingdom s de facto ruler will participate in the summit in argentina at the end of the month as part of a foreign trip al arabiya television quoted the country s energy minister as saying on monday
in his speech king salman said riyadh would continue working with opec and oil producers to maintain stability in global energy markets
he reaffirmed saudi support for a palestinian state with east jerusalem as its capital a position thrown into question last year when the crown prince appeared to back a nascent peace plan that aligns with israel on key issues
later on monday the king travelled to the northern tabuk region resuming a domestic tour in the latest public outreach apparently intended to show support for his chosen heir
last week after offering numerous contradictory explanations for khashoggi s disappearance riyadh said he had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to convince him to return to saudi arabia failed
the public prosecutor said it would seek the death penalty for five suspects in the case
turkish president tayyip erdogan has said the order for the killing of khashoggi came from the highest level of the saudi leadership but probably not from king salman putting the spotlight instead on the crown prince
president donald trump has suggested ultimate responsibility lies with the prince as de facto ruler
his administration has imposed economic and travel restrictions on a few individuals for alleged involvement including a top aide to prince on monday the king signalled that the crown prince remains empowered to pursue ambitious economic reforms praising a comprehensive developmental transformation underway
he directed his son sitting in the hall to focus on preparing the new generation for future jobs
king salman also praised the saudi judiciary and prosecution service for performing the duties they were entrusted with without elaborating
in addition to the khashoggi case the public prosecutor has participated in an campaign ordered by prince mohammed last year in which scores of princes ministers and businessmen were arrested and the state said it recovered billion in stolen assets
