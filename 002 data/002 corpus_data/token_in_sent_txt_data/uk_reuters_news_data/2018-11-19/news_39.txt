london nov reuters most of northern europe will experience temperatures from december to february while there will be warmer wetter and windier conditions in the south the weather company said on monday
november has been another in a long string of months across much of europe although the last days of the month should be considerably colder especially across northeastern europe as cold continental easterly flow will set up said todd crawford chief meteorologist with the weather company
the pattern change that is driving this colder weather is a bit of foreshadowing for the winter as a whole as there are indications that this sort of blocking may be more of a player this year for the first time in many winters he added
