norway's wealth fund should divest from rwe -green groups
oslo reuters green groups have urged norway s trillion wealth fund to sell its small stake in german power firm rwe saying the company is a heavy polluter due to its plants
greenpeace said in a report published on tuesday that it was disgraceful that the world s largest sovereign wealth fund was still invested in rwe
rwe is germany s largest power producer and operates a number of power plants
the report entitled last gasp the coal companies making europe sick was by greenpeace the sandbag climate and other environmentalists
it used a european atmospheric model to estimate how coal power plant emissions impact pollution levels in the air over europe and found rwe to be the worst offender
rwe said it was unable to comment specifically on the report as it had not seen it
however it said that all its power stations fully complied with the emission limits established by law and the authorities
the legislator s intention is to keep human health from being jeopardized with the limits having the greatest protective effect on senior citizens and children
we constantly work on further reducing our specific emissions rwe said in an emailed response to reuters request for comment
in this context account should be taken of the fact that the emissions of our power plants above all nitrous oxides only account for a very small portion of the emissions in the power stations surroundings
norway s wealth fund which is mandated to divest from companies that derive more than percent of their revenues or activities from coal had a percent stake in rwe as of the end of worth million according to the fund s own data
this new analysis should be a clear call for the norwegian government pension fund and other major rwe shareholders to exit the company martin norman head of greenpeace nordic s sustainable finance campaign told reuters
the wealth fund declined to comment
since it was mandated in to avoid companies heavily reliant on coal the wealth fund has divested from companies mostly coal miners but also utilities using coal in their energy mix
it has kept investments in companies that have a credible plan to reduce their share of revenues from coal increase revenues from renewable energy
it was not clear whether rwe derives more than percent of its activities from coal
the wealth fund s ceo yngve slyngstad said in an interview with reuters last month that it was generally very difficult to get good data from power producers on this
rwe said in its emailed response that it had a set a roadmap to sharply cut carbon dioxide emissions from lignite in
the roadmap reveals that emissions will be cut by up to percent by as early as
it is regrettable that such facts have apparently not been considered in the report rwe said
rwe also said that after its asset swap transaction with german peer is completed it would become europe s renewables player
it said renewables would account for roughly percent of its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation ebitda and that percent of its power generation portfolio would produce electricity with low or absolutely no carbon emissions
