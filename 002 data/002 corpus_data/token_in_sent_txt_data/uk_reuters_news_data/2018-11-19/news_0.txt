the slovak government subsidises mining at the country s only coal company privately owned hornonitrianske bane prievidza hbp paying around million euros million a year which helps maintain thousands of jobs
the company produced million tonnes of brown coal last year supplying the novaky power plant in central slovakia
the facility is operated by slovenske elektrarne a utility by the state italy s enel and czech energy group eph
slovenske elektrarne said this year that extending the life of the novaky plant beyond would require significant investment

closing the mines has long been contentious as they employ around people directly and indirectly
slovakia s car industry is booming though potentially giving retrained workers the chance to secure another job
we will soon unveil an action plan and announce the year as the end of subsidies for the coal mines ziga told reporters on the sidelines of an energy conference in bratislava
