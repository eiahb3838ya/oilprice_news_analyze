despite climate pledges, china struggles to break coal habit
xuzhou china reuters in a former mining district in eastern china authorities have shut dozens of pits and invested billions of yuan to resculpt the broken landscape creating gardens forest walks and wetland parks as well as a small museum dedicated to coal
there were many villages specialising in running coal mines and when the mines were shut down we lost around of our income we were under huge economic pressure said meng qinqxi a senior communist party official in mazhuang a village on the outskirts of the heavy industrial city of xuzhou
this problem is not ours alone but a national policy and no one can resist xuzhou in the yangtze river delta manufacturing hub of jiangsu shut its coal pits a decade ago after years of mining one of many districts to stop producing the filthiest of fossil fuels in line with central government directives
but despite an unprecedented surge of investment in alternative energies together with caps on coal use and the establishment of zones throughout the country china s overall consumption and production are again rising
when president donald trump said he was pulling the united states out of the paris climate accord last year china reaffirmed its commitments to tackle the problem of coal by far the biggest source of its carbon emissions
the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc said in a landmark report this month that unprecedented changes were needed to keep global temperature rises to within degrees celsius including profound cuts in burning coal
china has made efforts to cut the share of coal in total energy use with the figure expected to drop to percent by down more than percentage points in a decade
it has also already met a target to cut the amount of carbon dioxide it emits per unit of growth
but the absolute volumes of both coal and remain by far the world s highest and are still set to rise
though some studies have suggested total emissions peaked at gigatonnes in well ahead of its official target of around environmental group greenpeace says they could reach a new high this year or next
coal production has also risen percent in the first of this year to billion tonnes
falling coal demand after as the economy slowed lumbered china s massive coal sector with a huge supply glut and crippling debts
giant miners such as china shenhua energy sought to transition into alternative energies amid forecasts of a structural decline in coal use
but fortunes have recovered rapidly since when state efforts to shed excess capacity coincided with a revival in demand
shenhua s profits nearly doubled in while net earnings at rival yanzhou coal surged more than percent compared with the previous year
china embarked on an energy transformation in terms of cutting coal and developing renewables but we are now facing difficulties on both fronts said li shuo senior climate advisor with greenpeace
big regions such as inner mongolia and shanxi have been under pressure to cap capacity and the state promised to shut million tonnes of annual production between and
it also banned the import and use of coal
but despite closing uneconomical pits official annual production capability rose to billion tonnes by the end of june up from billion tonnes a year earlier the national energy administration nea said this month
another million tonnes were under construction
closures have been offset by rises in output elsewhere
though all collieries in xuzhou have closed the city s main mining firm continues to produce large volumes of coal coal chemicals and power running projects elsewhere in china as well as bangladesh and pakistan
the xuzhou mining group produced million tonnes of coal last year up percent on the year
and while provinces such as hebei and shandong have set targets to cut coal use and convert heating systems to cleaner natural gas others are still approving new power plants
power has remained the cheapest and most readily available option for many local governments with many already struggling to find enough natural gas to supply local houses with heat
china s mainly thermal power capacity rose gigawatts gw from the end of to the end of august this year more than half of all new domestic capacity over the period and almost enough to power australia nea data showed
according to the china electricity council china added gw of power capacity in alone down gigawatts compared with but still more than the country s entire nuclear reactor fleet
beijing s decarbonisation plans have been hit by grid bottlenecks and subsidy backlogs that have impeded efforts to maximise solar and wind generation
solar capacity grew by a record gw in but additions are capped at gw this year
they have also been hurt by a slowdown in the construction of nuclear reactors one of the few alternative power sources that can provide the reliable baseload generation role currently played by traditional plants
with renewables ramping up so quickly it has given the illusion of decarbonisation but china is falling into the same trap that germany has fallen into deploying lots of renewables that have to be backed up with lots of power plants said li ning nuclear scientist and dean of the college of energy at xiamen university
with no new commercial reactors approved in nearly three years local authorities have had little choice but to turn to more cheaper and more reliable coal to provide the baseload
china pledged to launch another six to eight reactor projects this year but li said it was unlikely it would get around to making the required approvals until next year
if nuclear can t keep up then it is coal he said
