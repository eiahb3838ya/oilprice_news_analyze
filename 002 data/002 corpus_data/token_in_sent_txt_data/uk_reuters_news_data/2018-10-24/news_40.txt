shares in the group hit a low following the statement which said an unplanned plant shutdown in the had also hurt earnings

the possible profit decline in automotive related products might more than be included in its share price decline baader analyst christian obst said in a note to clients
voestalpine which makes around one third of group sales from the auto industry said the car market in europe had been distorted by a new exhaust emission test procedure introduced on and related uncertainties
chief executive wolfgang eder warned last week that after three boom years the auto industry must adjust to the fact that demand will no longer grow quite as strongly
german premium carmaker daimler issued its second earnings warning since june last week partly blaming new emissions standards
