update 3-turkey won't allow greek interference in east med activities -minister
reuters turkey warned greece on wednesday to stay out of its activities in the eastern mediterranean heralding a potential showdown with cyprus over hydrocarbons research in a region thought to be rich in natural gas
turkish defence minister hulusi akar said ankara would not tolerate further greek harassment of turkish vessels after complaining last week that a greek frigate had hassled a turkish exploration ship west of cyprus
greece which has a defence protection pact with close ally cyprus denied the charge
attempts to tap hydrocarbons in the eastern mediterranean along with a dispute over greece s maritime borders have revived tensions between athens and ankara nato allies who are separated by the aegean sea
turkey and the internationally recognised greek cypriot government in cyprus have overlapping claims of jurisdiction for offshore oil and gas research in the eastern mediterranean
both sides plan exploratory drills this year
turkish officials earlier this month said a drill would take place in october
our warships are providing the necessary protection in the region
we will never tolerate new harassment akar told turkey s state anadolu news agency
we have taken all kinds of measures
i want everyone to know that we will not tolerate a fait accompli of any sort on this cyprus which has no diplomatic relations with turkey accused ankara of stirring up tensions
we are not going to go along with this artificial climate of tension which is trying to give an impression that there is a dispute cypriot government spokesman prodromos prodromou said
there is no dispute in the seas of breakaway north cyprus which is supported by turkey says any offshore wealth also belongs to them as partners in the establishment of the cyprus republic in
greek cypriots who run the island s internationally recognised government say any future benefits of gas finds will eventually be shared by all cypriots
the island was split in after a turkish invasion triggered by a brief coup
countless peacemaking endeavours have failed and offshore wealth has increasingly been the elephant in the room of peace negotiations even though greek cypriots say that matter is not up for discussion
