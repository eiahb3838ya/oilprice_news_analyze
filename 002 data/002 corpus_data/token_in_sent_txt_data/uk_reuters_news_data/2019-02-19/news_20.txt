british start-up breeds high performance bugs for animal feed
london reuters after centuries of selective breeding of animals and plants to maximize yields in agriculture bugs are getting the same treatment as demand for insect protein grows
british beta bugs is breeding high performance strains of black soldier fly for the insect feed sector and is selecting traits like growth rate protein content fat composition and even temperature tolerance according to clients needs
most animal feed is made from soy which is blamed by some for deforestation as farmers try to meet increasing global demand for the crop
this has led to the search for more sustainable sources of protein
there are insect farms around europe around the uk even elsewhere in the world which are using food waste and waste streams to rear insects such as the black soldier fly which they can then feed to fish chickens and we re looking at it from the genetic side
how do we make the best fly and the best bug possible for use in these farms founder and managing director of beta bugs thomas farrugia told reuters
the company breeds certain strains of fly resulting in highly optimized insects
the feed is made from fly maggots
you can cram decades worth of genetic progress that has been made in every other animal into a few years for insects said farrugia
beta bugs says it wants to stimulate the growth of a new and environmentally beneficial industry by bringing real benefits directly to farms
