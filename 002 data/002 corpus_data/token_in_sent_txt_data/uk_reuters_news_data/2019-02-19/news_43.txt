'basic needs before infrastructure': fashioning a fairer senegal
dakar feb reuters for fashion designer sophie zinga working to create a fairer senegal should be a priority for its next leader and if he can turn the country into a magnet for the creative arts too then all the better
the new zinga believes macky sall s outgoing government has not done enough to promote her industry and others like it and blames a skills shortage among local tailors for failing to sell any of her designs for the first two years after launching her own label in
i think dakar could position itself as a premier destination in all of the creative sectors she said
so on sunday she ll be voting for sall s main rival newcomer ousmane sonko who short to prominence in after denouncing corruption
we are not saying he is the best candidate she said
but
i think its a message to macky sall even for him to help us develop this country and develop it through education through health care basic needs before we go into big reporting by christophe van der perre editing by john stonestreet
