lab-grown steak could be worse for climate than flatulent cattle - scientists
barcelona feb thomson reuters foundation scientists and companies working to grow meat from animal cells will need to minimise energy use and avoid fossil fuels if claims that cultured meat is better for the climate than real meat are to hold true researchers said
cultured meat production with high energy inputs could spur global warming more in the than some types of beef cattle farming if the world shunned a path said a study published on tuesday by the oxford martin school
lead author john lynch a researcher at the university of oxford said reducing beef consumption would help curb climate change as methane emitted by cattle is a potent gas
but how best to replace conventional meat remained unclear
we have to dig into the details a bit more to know if the substitutes would be as beneficial as claimed he told the thomson reuters foundation
it just comes down to how much energy demand would be to produce a kilogramme of lynch said companies promising to bring clean meat to the mass market many of them based in the united states and israel had yet to release information on their planned production processes
the website of one firm memphis meats which produced the world s first meatball in followed by poultry in says its meat cultivated at scale would use significantly less land water energy and food inputs
our process will produce less waste and dramatically fewer greenhouse gas emissions
we believe that the planet will be the ultimate beneficiary of our product it adds without giving details of how that would be achieved
memphis meats has received investment from business tycoons bill gates and richard branson as well as multinational corporations cargill and tyson foods
david welch director of science and technology at the good food institute a nonprofit that supports companies producing clean meat said it would likely be another five to years before cultured meat products were commercially available to consumers
development work was still being carried out in labs with production facilities yet to be set up he added
the oxford martin school study said research on greener ways of producing cultured meat was a priority at this nascent stage
its study used four hypothetical cultured meat production methods concluding the most would not warm the planet more than farming beef in the long term even without decarbonisation of the global energy system
if the real clean meat production processes are like that one then there is no problem said lynch
livestock are responsible for about percent of global greenhouse gas emissions according to the united nations food and agriculture organization
the good food institute plans this year to carry out an study of the environmental effects of cultured meat production with companies to deepen understanding of the risks and benefits including for land water and the climate
the oxford research highlighted a huge difference in the amount of time for which different greenhouse gases influence the climate
methane released from cattle manure and flatulence is more dangerous in the but fades fast
per tonne emitted methane has a much larger warming impact than carbon dioxide however it only remains in the atmosphere for about years whereas carbon dioxide persists and accumulates for millennia said study raymond pierrehumbert a physics professor at the university of oxford
as a result the researchers found over a period production of cultured meat could hike global warming more if the process depended heavily on energy
another important factor was land use they said
for example clearing forest land for could greatly increase the carbon footprint of beef production while growing meat in urban laboratories could free up land for storing carbon in vegetation or other ways
a separate paper from think tank chatham house said on tuesday cultured meat had the potential to contribute to the goals of the european union but policy makers would need to promote clear regulation and invest public funds in research development and commercialisation
