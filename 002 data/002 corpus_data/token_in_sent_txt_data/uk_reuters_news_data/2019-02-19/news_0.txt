peru launches 'sustained' crack-down on illegal mining in amazon
lima feb reuters peru on tuesday launched a new sustained effort to uproot illegal gold mining in one of the amazon s most biodiverse corners sending police and military officers to the region after deforestation from wildcat mining hit a new high last year
the government of president martin vizcarra said it was suspending civil liberties and tasking the armed forces with restoring the rule of law in districts rife with illegal mining in madre de dios or mother of god a rainforest region known for its high biodiversity forests and indigenous tribes that shun contact with outsiders
the state of emergency will be in place for days the defense ministry added in a statement
if successful the operation would mark the first time peru has been able to stop an illegal industry responsible for releasing tonnes of mercury into the environment as well as supporting sex trafficking and child labor in mining camps
the crackdown might also impact the production and shipment of gold from peru the world s producer as illegal ore often makes its way into the legal supply chain through middlemen and shell companies
previous in madre de dios have spawned contraband smuggling into bolivia
high gold prices during the global financial crisis fueled an illegal gold rush in madre de dios that has continued to expand
it s been growing for better part of a decade said luis fernandez a wake forest university ecologist who has been studying the issue since
in every town there are little shops that buy gold from miners that emit levels of mercury from power plants fernandez said
we re just starting to learn what the impacts will be on the wildcat miners in madre de dios are often tipped off about government plans to destroy illegal mining camps in the jungle allowing them to hide expensive machinery and flee
they then regroup once security forces leave the region
environmentalists say criminal groups that finance the mining are now better organized and more violent than ever
in deforestation from wildcat mining in southern peru where madre de dios is located peaked at hectares acres topping the previous high of hectares in according to a january report by monitoring of the andean amazon project maap which uses satellite images to track deforestation for the ngo amazon conservation
