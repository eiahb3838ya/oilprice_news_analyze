meet the sea squirt, sucking up plastic particles from the sea
eilat israel reuters a rubbery sea creature with an irritating habit of clinging to ships and invading beaches could help measure plastic pollution as it can filter tiny particles from the ocean and store them in its soft tissue
israeli researchers have found that ascidians round animals also known as sea squirts can thrive in dirty industrial areas and pristine waters alike allowing them to detect and analyse waste and its impact in various regions
a staggering amount of plastic flows into the ocean each year
the united nations says it is as if a garbage truck full of plastic was dumped into the water every minute a rate some estimates show could lead to oceans carrying more plastic than fish in years
but the impact of the waste particularly tiny pieces called microplastic is still not fully understood
sea squirts just sit in one place all their life and filter the water like a pump said gal vered of tel aviv university and who the researchers findings in the journal marine pollution bulletin
they can really give us a picture of what the whole reef the whole ecosystem felt during its as a bonus sea squirts are related in evolutionary terms to human beings
so studying them and the plastic inside them could be more insightful than looking at creatures like fish or clams
although we don t look alike at all we have similar systems said noa shenkar of tel aviv university s zoology department and museum of natural history
plastic never disappears
over time it breaks down into microplastics ranging from the size of a grain of rice on down
they mix with tiny plastic beads found in products like cosmetics and cleaners that were flushed away
these are eaten by wildlife filling their bellies exposing them to chemical additives and potentially entering the food chain said vered
vered searched piers and rocks in the red sea resort of eilat eventually finding a cluster of sea squirts on a brick
back in her lab a gentle push on one squirt s belly saw the creature let loose the eponymous squirt of water
invisible to the naked eye are the microplastics perhaps once part of a bag or bottle and that were found at all the sites they tested along israel s coasts
we as humans invented a material that can last for hundreds thousands of years and then we use it as a product
it s quite a paradox she said
