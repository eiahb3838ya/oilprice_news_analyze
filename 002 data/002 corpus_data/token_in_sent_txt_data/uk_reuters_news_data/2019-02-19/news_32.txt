bp to ramp up azeri shah deniz gas output, sees flat acg oil production
baku reuters bp plans to ramp up production at azerbaijan s shah deniz gas field and keep output flat at the acg oilfields this year a senior regional official at the british oil major said
a consortium said last week that it produced on average barrels per day of oil at acg last year a total of million tonnes almost unchanged from volumes
natural gas production from the shah deniz offshore field was billion cubic metres bcm and condensate output came to million tonnes up from bcm of gas and million tonnes of condensate in
we expect flat oil production from acg and a rise in gas production at shah deniz in as we will continue to ramp up production on shah deniz throughout this year and in the next few years bakhtiyar aslanbayli bp s vice president for azerbaijan georgia and turkey told reuters
he said the giant acg oilfields which have so far produced billion barrels of oil had the potential to yield another billion barrels
bp and azerbaijan in extended to their agreement to develop the acg fields a deal dubbed by the azeri government as the contract of the century when first signed in
the arrangement was initially due to run until
aslanbayli said a final investment decision regarding exploration and production on the east and central azeri field envisaged by the extended contract would be made in the first half of this year
aslanbayli said the consortium planned two maintenance shutdowns of platforms at the central azeri and west chirag oilfields this year for a couple of weeks each but both events were envisaged in production forecasts
he said the first gas from the second stage of azerbaijan s giant shah deniz field would be delivered to markets in europe on time in
we are quite confident that we will be able to deliver gas from shah deniz ii to europe next year as it was planned he said
the shah deniz i field has been pumping gas since while output from shah deniz ii is expected to reach bcm of natural gas per year with bcm earmarked for europe and bcm for turkey
aslanbayli said the capacity of pipelines along the southern gas corridor running from azerbaijan to europe could be expanded if and when additional volumes of gas become available
that could be new sources of supply from azerbaijan from other fields he said
he called the gas field promising and said bp planned to drill the first exploration well there this year
if everything is as promising as we expect the will actually have huge gas resources which could be definitely comparable to shah deniz he said
he added that the company would drill two exploration wells in shallow waters off the absheron peninsula and conduct testing exploration drilling on the gobustan onshore oilfield later this year
