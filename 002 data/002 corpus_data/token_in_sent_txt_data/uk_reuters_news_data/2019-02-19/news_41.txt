refile-environmentalists seek tougher eu curbs on balkan coal power plants
sarajevo reuters environmentalists urged eu policy makers on tuesday to take a tougher stance on air pollution from coal power plants in the western balkans blaming the fumes for deaths across europe each year
the plants with gigawatts gw capacity emitted the same amount of sulfur dioxide in as plants with times more capacity in the rest of the european union five environmentalist groups said in a report
lignite the most polluting coal is widely available in the region providing a cheap energy resource and the major source of energy for kosovo serbia bosnia macedonia and montenegro
the countries are members of the energy community which had a commitment to implement eu rules to curb pollution by
but investments in new power plants or technology to cut emissions have largely been delayed the report said
air pollution knows no borders and is still an invisible killer in europe said vlatka matkovic puljic senior health and energy officer at heal and the report s lead author
it is high time that eu step up efforts to clean up the air and decarbonise the power sector she said
the report said the west balkan power plants caused pollution across the eu and beyond that caused healthcare costs of up to billion euros billion a year
the region plans to add gw of new coal plant capacity in the next decade mainly financed by chinese banks the report said adding that most plants would not meet the eu s pollution control rules
governments in the region say they need to expand coal power generation to meet rising demand and ensure energy security and say that new coal plants would emit less greenhouse gases
the report called for stricter rules to be imposed on the energy community and said the european commission should make meeting those regulations a requirement for joining the eu
for now the countries in the energy community do not face any penalties if targets are not met
rather than investing in yet more outdated coal power plants western balkan leaders need to increase the share of sustainable forms of renewable energy said ioana ciuta energy coordinator at cee bankwatch one of the five groups behind the report
