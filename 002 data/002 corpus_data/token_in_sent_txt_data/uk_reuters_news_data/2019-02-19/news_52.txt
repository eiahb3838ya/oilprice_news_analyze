update 2-chinese traders freeze australian coal orders amid 40-day customs delays - sources
reuters chinese coal traders have stopped ordering australian coal as clearing times through china s customs have doubled to at least days according to major buyers in china and international coal merchants resulting in a sharp fall in australian prices
the traders and a broker said only cargoes from australia the biggest supplier of the fuel to the world s top consumer were affected
we have stopped ordering coal from australia because it is unknown how long the restriction will last said a manager at a trading company who usually buys around tonnes of australian coal every month
customs clearance typically takes five to days
now it can be as much as days said the manager asking not to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media
the world s biggest coking coal exporter bhp group played down any suggestion the customs delays had any connection to recent diplomatic tensions
i don t believe for one moment this is linked to some of the higher level issues of relationships between china and the rest of the world bhp chief executive andrew mackenzie said speaking during a conference call
he said the delays were not targeted against australia and reflected china s effort to balance domestic production versus imports
international traders confirmed the delays
yes the chinese ports are holding up all thermal shipments ex australia for days my clients are only buying spot indonesian coal said an australian coal trader who asked not to be named due to company policy
a coal broker at china s mining group minmetals said he had asked clients to put australian imports on hold
the delays have been a large contributor to slump in australian coal prices
spot cargo prices for thermal coal exports from australia s newcastle terminal have fallen by more than a quarter from their peaks to below per barrel amid ample supply and tepid demand especially from china
it was not clear why china had stepped up checks on australian imports but tension between beijing and canberra has grown in recent months over issues of cyber security and china s influence in pacific island nations
china s general administration of customs did not respond to a request for comment
there was no immediate response from the foreign ministry to a faxed request for comment
authorities at some ports notified importers verbally this month that australian thermal coal but also coking coal would take longer than usual to clear the manager said
a coal trader and a purchasing manager at a coke plant received similar notifications
none of the buyers were aware of the reason
australian newcastle coal price china has curbed coal imports in the past to support domestic coal miners and reduce consumption to tackle air pollution
it restricted indonesian coal imports in citing high impurities and low energy efficiency
this time round the restrictions seem targeted at australia
chinese demand for indonesian coal remains strong said a merchant specializing in supply from the southeast asian country
reuters reported in january that dozens of ships carrying coal and iron ore mostly from australia were waiting to unload outside ports due to possible customs delays
the thermal coal futures on china s zhengzhou commodity exchange hit yuan a tonne on monday just shy of the peak of yuan although the contract closed down percent yuan a tonne
traders in china and also on international markets said demand for indonesian and also russian coal was rising to make up for the shortfall in australian supply
refinitiv ship tracking data showed coal shipments departing from australia s newcastle port to china fell percent last month compared with december to million tonnes
as of monday shipments scheduled to leave in february were million tonnes
