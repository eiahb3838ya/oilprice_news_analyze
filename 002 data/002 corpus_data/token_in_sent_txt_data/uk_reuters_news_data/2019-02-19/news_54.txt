update 2-australia's oil search banks on 2020 sign-off for major expansion
melbourne reuters australia s oil search is confident its partners exxonmobil corp and total sa will be ready to sign off on two big projects in that together will double liquefied natural gas lng exports from papua new guinea
oil search had first hoped the projects to fuel an expansion of exxon mobil s png lng plant would be approved in but talks with the government took longer than expected after an earthquake hit the country a year ago
it was a very tough year in papua new guinea for a range of reasons and it started with the earthquake oil search chief executive peter botten said
the quake killed more than people in the rugged highlands region of one of the world s poorest countries destroyed homes roads and runways and knocked out gas and oil facilities
it also stoked antagonism against the png lng project as the country s take from the development has been much lower than anticipated and the government has been slow to pay out royalties to local communities
some people even blamed oil and gas operations for triggering the quake
in that context we were doing a lot of negotiations on major projects and those sensitivities i think have been really well addressed botten told reuters after the company reported its annual results
total is set to sign an agreement with the government by early april on its papua lng project and exxon mobil is expected to follow soon after on terms for an expansion of its png lng plant and development of a new gas field p nyang botten said
total s elk and antelope fields new gas from png lng fields and p nyang are set to feed gas into three new processing units at png lng roughly doubling its output to million tonnes a year at a cost of around billion according to analysts
i m very confident that a final investment decision is very achievable botten said
oil search which has a percent stake in the png lng project posted a percent rise in annual profit boosted by higher prices for its lng and oil which offset a loss of output after the earthquake
net profit for the year ended rose to million from million a year earlier but fell short of analysts forecasts around million according to refinitiv data
oil search raised its full year dividend to cents from cents in
oil search s shares fell percent in a slightly firmer broader market
production is expected to return to levels in and unit production costs are forecast to fall percent on the back of higher production it said
