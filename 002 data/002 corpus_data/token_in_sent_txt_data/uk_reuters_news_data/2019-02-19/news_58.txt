rpt-indian state to move planned saudi aramco refinery after farmers  protest
repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text by rajendra jadhav mumbai feb reuters opposition from farmers has prompted india s western state of maharashtra to move the location for what would be the country s biggest oil refinery chief minister devendra fadnavis said
oil companies and saudi aramco have teamed up to build the billion refinery which is aimed at giving india steady fuel supplies while meeting saudi arabia s need to secure regular buyers for its oil
but thousands of farmers are refusing to surrender land fearing it could damage a region famed for its alphonso mangoes vast cashew plantations and fishing hamlets that boast bountiful catches of seafood
after their protests land acquisition has been stopped for the refinery at the proposed site at nanar a village in ratnagiri district some km miles south of mumbai fadnavis said on monday
the refinery will be built at a place where local population won t oppose the project he said in a press conference without identifying a new location
fadnavis a member of prime minister narendra modi s bharatiya janata party bjp made the announcement after forging an alliance with regional party shiv sena for the upcoming general election
the location of refinery was one of the contentious issues between the parties with shiv sena opposing the refinery
the announcement comes as saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman is due to arrive in india on tuesday and is expected to announce investments in energy and infrastructure during the visit
the ratnagiri refinery petrochemicals ltd rrpcl which is running the project says the million bpd refinery and an integrated petrochemical site with a capacity of million tonnes per year will help create direct and indirect employment for up to people with jobs that pay better than agriculture or fishing
rrpcl a joint venture between indian oil corp ioc hindustan petroleum and bharat petroleum has said suggestions the refinery would damage the environment were baseless
the company is hopeful that the state government will provide sufficient land for the project on the western coast anil nagwekar a spokesman for the rrpcl told reuters
land acquisition has always been a contentious issue in rural india where a majority of the population depends on farming for its livelihood
in for example india s tata motors had to shelve plans for a car factory in an eastern state after facing widespread protests from farmers
