corrected-republican backlash against trump epa pick fueled by 'biofuel reset'
york reuters epa acting administrator andrew wheeler rejected a proposal from his staff that would have reduced the ambition of the nation s biofuel policy over the next three years arguing the targeted range it included for annual ethanol consumption was too low according to two sources familiar with the matter
the decision made in december as part of the epa s effort to reset targets set by congress in closer to market reality has become a source of concern among the oil industry s republican legislative backers some of whom have threatened to withhold support for wheeler s confirmation as permanent epa head over his views on ethanol
the issue represents the latest flashpoint in the ongoing clash between big oil and big corn over the nation s biofuel policy which has complicated president donald trump s relationship with the two rival constituencies that helped sweep him to the white house in
under the renewable fuel standard oil refiners must blend billions of gallons of biofuels into their gasoline and diesel each year or buy credits from those that do
the corn industry is constantly pushing for targets to go up to ensure a robust market for growers while the oil industry wants them to decline because biofuels compete with petroleum and compliance costs them money
wheeler rejected a staff proposal presented in december that suggested the amount of ethanol that must be blended into the nation s fuel could be cut from the current level of billion gallons annually to as low as billion over the final three years of the rfs program ending in a figure that had been sought by the oil industry according to two of the sources
epa staff made the proposal in the form of a range of billion to billion the two sources said
wheeler who has been running the agency on an interim basis since his predecessor scott pruitt resigned in july dismissed the proposal saying the billion gallons at the bottom of the range was too low and would guarantee outrage from lawmakers one of the sources briefed on the matter said
a second source familiar with the matter said wheeler had rejected the billion number because it was not clear if agency staff had considered the potential impact of a published epa proposal to lift a summer ban on sales of blends of gasoline called which could boost the market for the fuel
asked about the exchange the epa s assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation bill wehrum last week said we ve talked to wheeler about what we should do in the reset but no final decisions have been he added the work on the reset continued
epa spokesman michael abboud said on friday epa is still developing options regarding a reset proposal and no final decisions have been five republican senators from oil states led by ted cruz of texas sent a letter to wheeler dated asking him about his biofuels policies and saying their support for his confirmation could hinge on his responses
trump nominated wheeler in january but he still faces a senate vote likely to take place at the end of february
two sources told reuters the senators were particularly concerned about wheeler s rejection of the initial staff proposal on biofuel volume targets
officials from the senators offices did not respond to requests for comment explaining their concerns
the senators were also concerned that wheeler had signaled in several recent meetings the agency could issue fewer exemptions to the nation s biofuel laws to small refineries than under pruitt according to the sources
pruitt s expanded use of the waivers which are intended for small refining operations under financial strain angered farmers and their legislative backers by exempting some billion gallons of ethanol from the mandates
but it also saved the oil industry hundreds of millions of dollars by driving down the cost of compliance credits
one justification wheeler could use for providing fewer waivers is that the lower credit prices have reduced the financial burden on refiners
but in recent weeks refiners like valero energy corp and hollyfrontier have been buying more of them than usual three brokers told reuters a sign that they expect a rebound
in their letter to wheeler the senators asked him if he would continue providing waivers fully in accordance with the statute and case the senators have also been worried by wheeler s meetings with biofuel trade groups and senators according to one of the sources briefed by the senators staff
a reuters analysis of wheeler s public schedule shows he has met regularly with representatives of both sides of the debate but has held several more meetings with corn backers than refining industry supporters since taking over in july
epa spokesman michael abboud has said that wheeler is happy to meet with those who actually request this version of the story corrects title for epa official bill wehrum to epa assistant administrator for the office of air and radiation in paragraph additional reporting by chris prentice editing by richard valdmanis and susan thomas
