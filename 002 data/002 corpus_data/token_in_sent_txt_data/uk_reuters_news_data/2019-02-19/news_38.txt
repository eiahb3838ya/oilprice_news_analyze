despite sanctions, iran's oil exports rise in early 2019-sources
london reuters iran s exports of crude oil were higher than expected in january and are at least holding steady this month according to tanker data and industry sources as some customers have increased purchases due to waivers from sanctions
shipments are averaging million barrels per day bpd in february refinitiv eikon data showed and a source at a company that tracks iranian exports said
they were between and million bpd in january higher than first thought
a high rate of iranian shipments would weigh on oil prices and work against a global push to cut supply in led by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
opec member iran negotiated an exemption from the pact
we think people are taking more ahead of the deadline said the industry source who tracks iranian exports referring to the scheduled end of sanctions waivers in may
increased exports from the islamic republic might prompt renewed efforts to clamp down on flows
however this would run the risk of driving up oil prices as washington is also seeking to curtail exports from another foe venezuela
iran s exports have become more opaque since sanctions on the country s oil sector took effect in november
while most agree they have dropped steeply views on flows can differ by as much as several hundred thousand barrels per day enough to affect prices
the february shipments are up from january s million bpd according to refinitiv
the industry source estimated january exports at million bpd close to february s level
in any case the january figures are higher than initial estimates
some had predicted iranian crude exports would stay below million bpd last month a similar rate to that in december
a source at a second company that tracks iranian exports said shipments in the first days of february were above million bpd and on a rising trend higher than the source expected
washington gave waivers to eight buyers including china india japan and south korea which were all purchasing iranian crude in february according to refinitiv
the rise in shipments raises the prospect of less generous waivers should washington renew such exemptions when those in place expire
the special representative for iran said last month there would be a much deeper reduction in iranian exports
shipments have dropped steeply from at least million bpd in april the month before president donald trump withdrew the united states from a nuclear deal with iran and reimposed sanctions
tehran has vowed to keep exporting oil despite efforts to reduce its shipments to zero
