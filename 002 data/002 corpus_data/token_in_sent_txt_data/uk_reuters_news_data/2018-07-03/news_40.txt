jera beefs up into asian trading giant with edf's lng business
reuters japan s jera has bulked up into one of asia s biggest energy traders with its second acquisition of a key team from france s edf trading its lng business a deal aimed at making the utility more savvy and nimble as well as gaining better access to european markets
the signing of the deal which follows the purchase of edf trading s coal business last year brings a further infusion of the french company s more aggressive trading style into a traditional power firm
and together they plan to put together a large trading operation
there are no other utilities in japan that trade both coal and lng yuji kakimi president of jera a venture between tokyo electric power and the chubu electric power told reuters in an interview
altogether we re a team whereas other japanese utilities have just a few he said
that number for jera trading a unit based in singapore represents an increase of about
that includes people from edft staff in tokyo while the rest will be a mix of current jera employees and new hires
trader numbers will be a few dozen a company official said
competitors say the combination of jera the world s biggest importer of lng and a leading buyer of thermal coal with edf s highly regarded coal and gas teams could herald big changes for the industry
they have plentiful cash they have global positions to allow them to move fast and they have the personnel to act said a senior trader with a major commodity merchant declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to media
the question is whether japan s conservative utility culture can or wants to keep western traders on their books he added
addressing the concern that the two disparate business cultures might not work well kakimi acknowledged there are differences in about how much risk we take in various but he said he had no plans to change the way edft traders did business and that jera trading would have a lot of autonomy
he added the two firms have been doing business for years and shared the same purpose ensuring their parent firms fossil fuel plants had cheap fuel
jera trading is held by jera with edf trading holding the rest and will handle spot trades
supply deals would remain under the parent firms in japan
the deal is likely to be finalised by early
kakimi also said jera trading could in the future look at collaborating with edft s team for liquefied petroleum gas though he added no concrete discussions were taking place

the market is also moving away from its established model dominated by japan of receiving the fuel under fixed volumes and prices towards one in which cargoes are bought and sold at short notice in the spot market
trade data shows spot market volumes this year have already exceeded those of all of fivefold and they will likely double between and
in particular jera is seeking to boost spot market and expand its access to europe a huge pipeline gas market that consumes million tonnes annually and where excess lng could be sold
the consumption of lng is changing greatly and the lng market is gradually becoming more commoditised and so our main objective is become a firm that can deftly respond to those changes and key to that is access to europe kakimi said
the deal allows jera to share edft s access to lng terminals in europe that connect to six gas hubs in great britain france the netherlands belgium and spain
edft s coal trading team has already proven its earnings worth kakimi said adding that jera trading has been buying coal at least several percentage points cheaper than japan s average import price and jera has been making steady profits from trading
we have cultivated a financial trading capability via coal trading and we can do it for lng too he said
he also said contracts will likely slide to around percent of jera s lng contracts by around compared with about percent now
