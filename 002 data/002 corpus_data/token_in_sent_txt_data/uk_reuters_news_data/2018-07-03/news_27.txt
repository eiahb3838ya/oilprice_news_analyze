greenpeace crashes superman-shaped drone into french nuclear plant
paris reuters greenpeace crashed a drone into a french nuclear plant on tuesday to demonstrate its vulnerability to outside attacks the environmental group said
greenpeace said it had flown the drone piloted by one of its activists into the zone around utility edf s bugey nuclear plant near lyon and then crashed it against the wall of the plant s pool building
this action again highlights the extreme vulnerability of this type of buildings which contain the highest amount of radioactivity in nuclear plants greenpeace said
france generates percent of its electricity from nuclear power in nuclear plants operated by edf
edf said that two drones had flown over the bugey site of which one had been intercepted by french police
the presence of these drones had no impact on the security of the installations edf said adding that it will file a police complaint
the drone stunt follows a series of staged by greenpeace activists into french nuclear plants which greenpeace says are vulnerable to outside attack especially the pools
these pools can hold the equivalent of several reactor cores stored in concrete pools outside the highly reinforced reactor building
greenpeace says the buildings have not been designed to withstand outside attacks and are the most vulnerable part of french nuclear plants
pools must be turned into bunkers in order to make nuclear plants safer said greenpeace france s chief nuclear campaigner yannick rousselet
edf said the pool buildings are robust and designed to withstand natural disasters and accidents
greenpeace s security breaches have sparked a parliament investigation into nuclear security which is due to present its report on thursday
in october greenpeace activists broke through two security barriers and launched fireworks over edf s cattenom nuclear plant
in february a french court gave several greenpeace activists suspended jail sentences while ordering the group to pay a fine and euros in damages to edf
