the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london july reuters traffic volumes are levelling off in a sign the previous stimulus from cheap gasoline prices is fading as pump prices rise
the volume of traffic on roads was down by almost percent in april compared with the same month a year earlier after seasonal adjustments according to statistics released on monday
traffic volumes declined for the first time since the first quarter of according to the federal highway administration traffic volume trends fhwa july
volumes in any one month can be distorted by the timing of public holidays the distribution of working days and weekends and unusual weather patterns
but the rate of growth in traffic volumes has been slowing consistently since early coinciding with the rise in gasoline prices after accelerating during coinciding with the previous oil price slump
traffic volume growth has been correlated with the rise and fall in retail gasoline prices over at least the past years among other factors
cheap gasoline provided a significant stimulus to driving during the latter part of and throughout but the impact has faded as average pump prices have climbed back towards per gallon
the slowdown in traffic volume growth is consistent with separate data showing a levelling off in the quantity of gasoline consumed in after rapid growth in
the quantity of gasoline supplied to domestic consumers during the first four months of rose by just million barrels or percent compared with the same month a year earlier petroleum supply monthly eia june
eia forecasts gasoline consumption will grow by just barrels per day bpd in and bpd in after rising by just bpd in but bpd in and bpd in
by contrast distillate consumption is predicted to rise by bpd in and another bpd in energy outlook eia june
besides the impact on miles driven oil prices influence gasoline consumption through motorists choices about new vehicles purchased and the retirement of older vehicles from the fleet
during the price slump consumers switched to purchasing larger vehicles with lower fuel economy reversing the earlier trend towards smaller cars and more efficient engines in the process boosting gasoline consumption
now prices are climbing fuel economy is set to become more important for vehicle buyers again and there is likely to be a shift back towards smaller more engines restraining further consumption growth
over the last seven decades there has been a clear link between oil prices and fuel consumption growth rates which has been confirmed during the most recent cycle
oil consumption is normally led by gasoline during the first phase of each cyclical upswing until distillates become the primary driver in the second phase
during the first phase of the current cyclical recovery the rise in oil consumption was led by gasoline consumption by private motorists but that impact is now fading as gasoline prices climb
further consumption growth increasingly relies on the distillate fuels used in freight transport as well as the industrial sector and on oil and gas drilling sites
notwithstanding strong demand for distillates rising oil prices are already starting to restrict overall consumption growth principally through their impact on gasoline sales
as a result eia forecasts petroleum consumption will increase by just bpd in and bpd in after rising by bpd in bpd in and bpd in
rising oil prices are already helping to restrain consumption growth and rebalance the oil market and any further escalation will accelerate the effect
