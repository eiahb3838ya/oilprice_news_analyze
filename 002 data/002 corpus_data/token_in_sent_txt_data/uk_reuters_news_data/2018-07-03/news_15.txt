german engineering group warns of drop in new wind power projects
frankfurt reuters a drop in the number of new german wind power projects coming on stream in and the early could make it harder to achieve economies of scale and hit investment according to the country s vdma mechanical engineering group
that in turn could jeopardize germany s target of producing percent of power from renewable sources by which is expected to require gigawatts gw of total offshore wind capacity four times the current number vdma said
policymakers have recently shifted the industry away from fixed tariffs towards auctions for new building permits hitting the profitability of wind power companies
vdma believes the transition may have been too drastic leading to a slowdown in new projects already this year
the will have a serious dent in for onshore and a complete stalling of offshore projects in and while other european countries have a steady order pipeline said matthias zelinger head of vdma s power systems unit naming the netherlands denmark and britain as more supportive of their wind industries
this could erode the competitiveness of germany as a reference market for component manufacturers he said in an interview adding competition was shaping up in china and the united states
the unit groups a few dozen companies involved in supplying industries including leading names in wind siemens gamesa nordex and senvion mhi vestas and general electric
while two thirds of the unit s turnover comes from exports zelinger said it was important as for the car industry for the technology to thrive near where the equipment is produced
industry figures show gw of capacity were added in the onshore german wind industry last year while that figure could fall to gw in and gw in
offshore wind construction in germany s north and baltic seas last year came in at gw while from this year only gw are under construction up to
permits after that are optional and for more capacity to emerge policymakers must build grids and phase out old thermal plants vdma said
in the short term zelinger said the government should award megawatts mw more onshore wind capacity in and add gw to offshore auction volumes and consider a price floor for carbon pollution rights
