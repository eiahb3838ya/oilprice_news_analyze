corrected-galp to start drilling exploration well offshore portugal
lisbon reuters portuguese oil company galp energia is set to start drilling the country s first deep water offshore exploration well but with only modest hopes of success its exploration and production director said on monday
the project being developed by a consortium of galp and italy s eni off the alentejo region s vicentine coast known for its beaches and large natural park has led to protests by environmental activists and local municipalities
thore kristiansen told reuters on the fringes of a petroleum engineering event in lisbon the seismic data shots made the project look interesting enough so that we at least have to try even if turns out dry
he said the partners were calibrating the project to meet various conditions set by the portuguese environmental agency in may but did not expect any delays
the agency has deliberated that drilling has to be carried out at some point between september and january
but this is frontier drilling
nobody has done it before and there is a high likelihood that we will not find anything he said adding that the geological formation could be similar to the structures along the eastern coast of canada
we have applied the same models for what we are doing in portugal
but the reality is that we don t know he said
the company which has most of its best assets in brazil s large offshore oil fields plans to boost output by percent by to barrels of oil equivalent per day and hopes to increase its natural gas output after by bringing onstream the giant mamba area in mozambique
partners in the mamba project headed by operator eni expect to submit their operation and development plan to the government very very soon kristiansen said projecting the final investment decision on the project next year
in angola kristiansen expects to bring onstream the kaombo norte offshore project in august while a second floating production unit should start production next year
the two should compensate for recent declines in output from mature angolan fields
asked about galp s potential interest in the likely sale of a large stake in brazil s offshore santos basin by petrobras as part of the dispute kristiansen said he could not disclose any concrete plans
but he also said galp would study all possibilities for further development and growth in brazil including the transfer of rights licenses
