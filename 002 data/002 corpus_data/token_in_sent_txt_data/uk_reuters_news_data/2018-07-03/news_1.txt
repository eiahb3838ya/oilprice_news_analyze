update 1-venezuela says it will receive $250 mln from china to boost oil output
adds details of statement comment by finance minister caracas july reuters venezuela will receive million from the china development bank to boost oil production the south american country s finance ministry said in a statement on tuesday
further details on the terms of the deal were not immediately available
venezuelan state oil company pdvsa did not respond to a request for comment
the south american country previously accepted a billion loan from china which became venezuela s principal financier over the last decade but has recently cooled on venezuela amid its economic meltdown and sharply declining oil production
we have clinched an authorization for direct investment from the china development bank to increase pdvsa s production of more than million and we are already moving forward specific financing as part of the special billion credit that the chinese government has given to venezuela for direct investment in production the statement quoted finance minister simon zerpa as saying
venezuela s oil production has sunk to a roughly low due to a mix of underinvestment theft a brain drain and lack of equipment helping push up global oil prices and piling misery on venezuela s economy
over a decade china plowed more than billion into venezuela s coffers through agreements that helped beijing secure energy supplies for its economy while bolstering an ally in latin america
but the flow of cash halted nearly three years ago when venezuela asked for a change of payment terms amid falling oil prices and declining crude output that pushed its economy into a hyperinflationary collapse
