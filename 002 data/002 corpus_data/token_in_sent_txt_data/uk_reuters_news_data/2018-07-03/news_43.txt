traders said that disruptions to libyan supplies were pushing up prices on tuesday outweighing a rise in june in supply from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec
opec s june output was million barrels per day bpd a reuters survey showed on monday up bpd from may
the june total is the highest since january
libya s national oil corporation noc declared force majeure on loadings from zueitina and hariga ports on monday resulting in total production losses of bpd due to the closure of eastern fields and ports
traders have also been watching oil production which has surged by percent over the last two years to million barrels per day bpd absorbing at least some of the recent disruptions
overall however analysts said opec s production policy as well as unplanned supply disruptions were currently the main price drivers
in the the level of opec production deployment of spare capacity by saudi arabia iraq uae kuwait and by russia and involuntary disruptions in libya venezuela iran are more important drivers of crude prices goldman sachs said in a note published late on monday
what has become a concern at least for producers is a slowdown in demand which may end years of consecutive records

petroleum demand growth slowed significantly to bpd in april compared with a growth of more than bpd in barclays bank said adding that this was mostly due to higher fuel prices
in asia the world s biggest oil consumption region seaborne oil imports have been falling since may as higher costs turned off consumers and the escalating trade dispute between the united states and china starts to impact the economy
there are signs that growth in china has slowed in recent months particularly infrastructure spending by local governments
i would assume that infrastructure investment is quite energy intensive so perhaps that had a effect to oil demand said frederic neumann of asian economic research at hsbc in hong kong
at this stage however it appears more that growth in asia is softening rather than decelerating sharply he added
