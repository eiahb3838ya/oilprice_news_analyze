u.s. drivers value fuel economy over brand as pump prices rise - poll
detroit reuters consumers put a high value on fuel economy when buying a new vehicle according to a opinion poll as automakers lobby the administration of president donald trump for relief from mileage requirements enacted by his predecessor
in a poll taken may to june percent of respondents said mileage was most important to them when buying a new vehicle after cost and safety but before warranty brand design and features like navigation
this is roughly the same set of priorities that adults set in a similar poll taken in july
among respondents who identified as trump voters percent said they wanted automakers to focus on improving fuel efficiency a higher share than respondents who identified as democrats or hillary clinton voters
the trump administration has signaled it could act soon to freeze emissions standards from through
the state of california and other states have said they will fight such an action leaving automakers to confront two separate emissions standards within the market
gasoline prices have risen about percent since trump took office mainly due to a pact by organization of the petroleum exporting countries and its allies to curtail oil output to help reduce an oversupply of crude
they agreed last month to boost output
but trump who has accused opec of manipulating oil prices wants group leader saudi arabia to pump even more crude
gasoline prices which could create a political headache for trump ahead of november elections are a visible cost of living indicator especially during the summer vacation season
a record million people in the are expected to travel more than miles for the of july holiday weekend
the average price of a gallon of regular gasoline was on july the highest level for the july period in four years according to aaa the motoring and travel group
but fuel economy is a challenging issue for automakers
trade groups representing major automakers competing in the united states have asked the trump administration for more leeway to meet obama administration vehicle fuel economy targets arguing the rules are costly and not in sync with consumer demand
those rules require automakers to slash the carbon emissions and roughly double the average fuel efficiency of their light vehicles by compared with
automakers are also worried that state mandates to sell more electric and hybrid vehicles will hurt profits because those vehicles are in a market that is shifting toward sport utility vehicles suvs and trucks
one reason is that sport utility vehicles on average are percent more fuel efficient than suvs of a decade ago and are now close to the fuel economy levels of a sedan according to an analysis by cox automotive which tracks market data and purchase trends
a new suv averages miles per gallon
a new car averaged miles per gallon
