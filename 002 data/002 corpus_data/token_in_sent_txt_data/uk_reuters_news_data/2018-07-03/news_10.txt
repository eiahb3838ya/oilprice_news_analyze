update 2-venezuela's declining crude exports squeeze india's refiners
adds context details on exports by marianna parraga july reuters venezuela s crude shipments to india its third largest export market fell percent in the first half of the year according to internal documents from pdvsa adding to supply troubles for indian refiners as they are increasingly pressed to diversify oil imports
venezuela s production decline to a low and export woes stemming from mismanagement lack of investment and payment delays are affecting almost all of the s customers
but the impact on india is notable and comes as its refiners are now preparing for a drastic reduction to zero of oil imports from iran
last week pdvsa officials met with executives from india s reliance industries and russia s rosneft which owns a majority stake in nayara energy to discuss trade issues the company said
the talks focused on how to remedy export delays according to a person familiar with the matter
venezuela sent almost barrels per day bpd of heavy crude to india in the first half of the year a percent drop versus the bpd shipped in the same period of according to pdvsa trade documents
the decline is the second steepest after the united states which has suffered a drop of about percent in crude imports from venezuela this year the documents seen by reuters show
if crude supplies from iran and venezuela two of india s top five oil suppliers can not be secured in coming months some of the nation s refiners would have to rely almost entirely on sourcing the heavy barrels they need from iraq according to analysts
indian refiners are very worried about supply from iran but also from venezuela said robert campbell from consultancy energy aspects
saudi arabia is expected to boost supply to india in the short term but those barrels would not match the quality of the missing venezuelan crude he added
the lack of heavy barrels is not a problem only in the atlantic basin but in asia as well he added
pdvsa and nayara did not reply to requests for comment
india s reliance declined to comment
india is the world s fourth largest refiner after the united states china and russia
while chinese and russian firms resell a large portion of the venezuelan crude and fuel they receive to monetize agreements indian refiners need the barrels they get through crude supply contracts with pdvsa
venezuela s crude output is declining faster than expected amid insufficient investment attempts to seize its overseas assets over payment disputes and skilled workers leaving its oil industry due to low salaries and an extended corruption probe within pdvsa
the country s oil production averaged million bpd in the first five months of according to figures reported to opec its lowest annual level since
the fall which is putting pressure on global supply and contributing to growing oil prices has also taken a toll on exports
pdvsa last month requested customers not send tankers to its main port of jose to alleviate congestion
but vessels have continued arriving mainly for chinese indian and clients according to thomson reuters vessel tracking data
the tanker bottleneck has worsened since may when conocophillips started legal actions to seize pdvsa s assets to satisfy a arbitration award blocking the firm from using its caribbean terminals
in june pdvsa shipped to india bpd after servicing some vessels that had waited for up to a month to load
the venezuelan firm plans to deliver some bpd in july according to reuters and pdvsa data
the unstable crude supply from venezuela to india in recent months has mainly benefited iraq india s largest crude source and united arab emirates which in may replaced venezuela as india s fourth biggest crude supplier
