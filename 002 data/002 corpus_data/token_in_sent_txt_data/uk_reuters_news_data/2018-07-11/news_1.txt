mexico's new government to focus on boosting fuel output at home
mexico city reuters mexico s next energy agenda will prioritize increasing gasoline and diesel production and later decide on possible changes to the industry reform championed by the outgoing government according to a top aide to andres manuel lopez obrador
rocio nahle tapped by lopez obrador to be energy minister told local outlet aristegui noticias on wednesday that the country s next government will address the energy imbalance in which mexico produces less fuel at home and turns to imports to meet national demand
lopez obrador won a landslide victory in the july election and will take office in december
we will be assessing if any legislative changes to the oil opening are necessary said nahle adding that the transition team would not immediately propose changes to the existing laws
the comments by nahle who also won a senate seat in the election are in line with lopez obrador s pledge last weekend to end mexico s massive fuel imports over the first three years of his term
so far this year mexico has imported an average of about barrels per day bpd of gasoline and another bpd of diesel almost all of it from the united states as gasoline output at the country s six refineries owned and operated by pemex has halved since the first year of outgoing president enrique pena nieto s term
domestic gasoline output barely meets a quarter of national demand from the country s legions of motorists
during the election campaign lopez obrador was sharply critical of the pena nieto s policy to allow foreign and private oil companies to operate fields on their own for the first time in decades ending pemex s monopoly
the overhaul was designed to reverse a oil output slide and has already resulted in competitive auctions that have awarded more than exploration and production contracts deals lopez obrador has repeatedly promised to review for signs of corruption
nahle said the next government will also begin construction of at least one new oil refinery which she expects to be operating by the halfway point of lopez obrador s term
so far this year pemex s existing refineries are producing an average of bpd of gasoline and about bpd of diesel according to company data
