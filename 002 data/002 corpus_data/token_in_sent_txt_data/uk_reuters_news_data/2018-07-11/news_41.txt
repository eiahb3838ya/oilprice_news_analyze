rosatom looks to nuclear newcomers to cement dominance
russian state firm is leader in global nuclear industry big rivals areva and westinghouse have lost ground rosatom pitches deals to suit nations new to nuclear china may pose biggest challenge in coming years by geert de clercq paris july reuters rosatom is in talks with jordan to revive a deal to build a nuclear plant in the kingdom according to the deputy ceo of the russian company which is looking to add another nuclear newcomer nation to its customer list
the firm is the clear leader in the global nuclear industry after two of its biggest rivals areva and westinghouse hit financial troubles and it has a track record of building plants in countries without any nuclear tradition
russia signed an intergovernmental agreement with the middle eastern country in to build a billion facility but there has been little progress since and in recent weeks there have been local media reports that jordanian authorities have scrapped the deal
kirill komarov deputy ceo of russian state nuclear firm rosatom told reuters that talks were still ongoing to resolve technical and financing issues without elaborating
the jordan deal was definitely not scrapped
maybe we need some more time with our jordanian colleagues komarov said
he added jordan was a difficult place for nuclear as a large part of the country was desert and a reactor needs lots of water for cooling
he said that one of the options being considered was to build a smaller reactor than originally envisaged a small modular reactor rather than a conventional one
industry experts say the main snag for the tender won by rosatom was disagreements between jordan and the russian company over how the project should be financed
a senior source in the jordan atomic energy commission told reuters the original project had been put on hold and now both parties were exploring the feasibility of constructing a small modular reactor
eight years ago france s areva was also in the running in jordan but it has since had a government bailout
renamed framatome it is now part of utility edf
the other big western reactor builder firm westinghouse has been in bankruptcy for more than a year limiting is ability to pursue foreign contracts
with chinese and south korean vendors lacking much experience with building reactors abroad that has left the field open for rosatom
the russian firm has an order book worth billion and contracts to build nuclear reactors in nine countries over the next decade including belarus bangladesh china india turkey finland hungary egypt and iran
framatome has one contract in its order book for a nuclear plant in hinkley point britain
westinghouse not a single one
the biggest challenge to rosatom s business could come from china in coming years according to industry experts
china has the ambition to become a top nuclear vendor through its companies even if it has little experience in building reactors abroad
with a deal to fund edf s project hinkley point project in britain and later build its own reactors there china has a foot in the door in a top european energy market and it has signed cooperation agreements in several countries without nuclear
china has the ability and the appetite to export nuclear said george borovas head of nuclear at law firm shearman sterling
i expect them to become very competitive in the global contracts rosatom has won most major global contracts over the past decade
in turkey a country with huge energy needs rosatom won a billion contract eight years ago to build own and operate four reactors in akkuyu on the mediterranean coast
concrete on unit was poured in april and komarov said rosatom has already invested billion
but it is still looking for a partner to take a stake of up to percent
komarov said rosatom is looking for a partner who can bring financing but also some industrial skills construction skills and an understanding of turkish energy markets
he said rosatom has held talks with several firms in turkey and the middle east and that rosatom is still targeting startup for the centenary of the turkish republic
industry experts say rosatom s key advantage is the range of options it can provide
unlike westinghouse and areva rosatom has the experience and financial clout to not only sell reactors but also to build the entire power plant around it
areva following its bailout was split up in fuel group orano and reactor builder framatome leaving rosatom as the world s only integrated nuclear firm with a shopping model from uranium enrichment to nuclear waste handling
rosatom s flexibility to offer different contracting methods and scenarios to suit the particular and financial capabilities of each country is a very smart way of approaching this industry said industry lawyer borovas
