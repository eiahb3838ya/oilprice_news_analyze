i kept it on my table
i will soon sign earlier ramaphosa told a business conference in abuja that south africa saw huge benefits from the continental free trade deal and that a draft agreement relating to the movement of people was being reviewed

both countries have been hit hard in recent years by low commodity prices that slowed growth cut government revenues and weakened their currencies

the continental zone which encompasses billion people was initially joined by countries in march

economists point to the continent s low level of trade as one of the reasons for africa s enduring poverty and lack of a strong manufacturing base
african union officials said countries that have signed the agreement will need to submit a schedule of tariffs by december adding that they expect trade to double over the next four years once tariffs are reduced
