austria to decide about future air defence jets by year-end
vienna reuters austria plans to decide by which fighter jets to use for its air defence in the future the defence minister said on wednesday
mario kunasek a member of the freedom party which entered government with chancellor sebastian kurz s conservatives in december decided in february to the previous government s decision to end a billion eurofighter jet programme early
a commission tasked with examining options for austria s air defence has delivered its report and on that basis a decision will be taken kunasek said on orf radio
it will still take some time to discuss details kunasek said
he said this included the financing of the purchase
my inhouse experts tell me that we need a decision by the end of the year he said when asked when to expect a decision
kunasek s social democratic predecessor hans peter doskozil launched an unprecedented legal battle against airbus and the eurofighter consortium in accusing them of fraud and wilful deception in connection with a eurofighter order
he then announced that austria would end its eurofighter jet programme early and replace the aircraft with a cheaper alternative fleet of aircraft
the consortium which includes airbus britain s bae systems and italy s leonardo have denied the accusations
but kunasek said in february that he did not feel bound by his predecessor s decision and on wednesday did not give a preference for a manufacturer in a possible signal that airbus still stood a chance
the commission has previously said it has received new price information for swedish and american jets which will be taken into account
