uk welcomes trump-putin meeting, says it must address russian "malign activity"
brussels july reuters british prime minister theresa may will on wednesday welcome a summit between president donald trump and his russian counterpart vladimir putin but say that it must be used to cut the risk of confrontation and address russian malign activity
trump is due to meet putin on monday a meeting which has raised eyebrows among western allies because it comes days after the leader attended a nato summit aimed at bolstering europe s defences against what it calls russian aggression
may s spokesman speaking to reporters ahead of a dinner for nato leaders on wednesday said the prime minister was planning to highlight cyber attacks and the use of a nerve agent on british soil
i welcome president trump s forthcoming meeting with president putin open channels of communication between the and russia are key to managing the risks of confrontation she planned to say according to the spokesman
her endorsement of the meeting attempts to cut off awkward questions about trump s commitment to nato an organisation he has openly and repeatedly criticised which has dogged the ongoing nato summit and threatened to undermine trump s visit to london later this week
earlier on wednesday trump called for nato leaders to increase their defence spending to percent of their country s economic output double the group s goal of percent which only a handful of members currently meet anyway
britain s official stance on russia has been engage but beware but direct diplomatic relations have effectively frozen since london blamed moscow for the use of a nerve agent in an attempted murder of a russian former spy living in england
russia has denied any involvement in the incident and rejects western claims that it has orchestrated high profile cyber attacks
at the nato dinner may will look to leverage the presence of fellow western leaders by urging that engagement with russia must come from a position of strength underpinned by a strong transatlantic alliance
as we engage russia we must do so from a position of unity and strength holding out hope for a better future but also clear and unwavering on where russia needs to change its behaviour for this to become a reality she planned to say
and as long as russia persists in its efforts to undermine our interests and values we must continue to deter and counter reporting by william james editing by catherine evans
