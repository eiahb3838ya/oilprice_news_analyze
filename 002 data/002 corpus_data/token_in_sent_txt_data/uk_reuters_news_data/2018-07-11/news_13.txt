update 9-trump calls germany "captive" of russia; demands higher defence spending
brussels reuters president donald trump accused germany on wednesday of being a captive of russia due to its energy reliance before a nato summit where he pressed allies to more than double defence spending
having lambasted nato members for failing to reach a target of spending percent of national income on defence trump told fellow leaders in brussels he would prefer a goal of percent similar to levels officials said
that would represent a massive upheaval of budgetary priorities in europe where germany and many others have pledged only to reach percent by or later and it was not clear what allies would spend the money on
at the end of the first session of a summit nato jens stoltenberg said the aim first was to reach percent but moments later trump tweeted that allies were undercutting the united states on trade and needed to immediately up spending
the exchange was part of an uncomfortable day as anxious western allies were subjected to the president s america first approach
his comment that germany was controlled by russia earned a rebuke from berlin
we are not prisoners neither of russia nor of the united states germany s foreign minister heiko maas told reporters
but trump was also at times enthusiastic and affable exchanging embraces and handshakes with fellow leaders posing for photographs in front of a nato military band and mingling at a summit dinner in a brussels museum
unlike a fraught group of seven summit in canada in june trump did not block a final leaders statement which paved the way for macedonia to start nato membership talks and a modernisation of the alliance to better deter moscow
earlier trump strode into nato s new headquarters and into the north atlantic council chamber to shake hands with leaders but only after publicly railing against germany one of nato s top european powers at a breakfast meeting with stoltenberg
trump told stoltenberg germany was wrong to support an baltic sea pipeline to import even more russian gas while being slow to meet targets for nato spending
we re supposed to be guarding against russia and germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to russia trump said in the presence of reporters
we re protecting germany we re protecting france we re protecting all of these countries
and then numerous of the countries go out and make a pipeline deal with russia where they re paying billions of dollars into the coffers of russia he said
i think that s very trump appeared to substantially overstate german reliance on russian energy and to imply berlin was funding a pipeline that chancellor angela merkel says is a commercial venture
she hit back by contrasting her own experience of growing up in east germany with the sovereign united germany now playing a major role in nato
trump and merkel later held businesslike talks on the sidelines
trump said he had a very very good relationship with merkel who described the two as good partners
a source close to french president emmanuel macron said trump had voiced his personal attachment to europe and gave rather positive and constructive messages to his allies
there is no between america and europe the source said after macron and trump held friendly talks
but with tensions in the alliance smouldering over trump s trade tariffs on european steel his earlier comments fuelled concerns about the role in keeping the peace that has reigned since world war two
belgian prime minister charles michel called for fair play and more respect for multilateralism
baltic leaders fearful of any repeat of russia s annexation of crimea called for unity while slovak president andre kiska said his country was one of the good guys because it was increasing defence spending
those comments underscored the risks to trump s strategy by dividing allies between those who spend more on defence and those who do not such as belgium spain italy and luxembourg but who contribute with troops to nato missions
nato s stoltenberg later told reporters that trump who will meet russian president vladimir putin on monday had used very direct language but that nato spending was rising strongly
the nato chief was also frank about the impact of trump s stance at a broader level
there are disagreements on trade
this is serious
my task is to try to minimise the negative impact on nato he said
so far it hasn t impacted on nato that much
i can not guarantee that that will not be the case in the future
