trump, merkel meet at nato after he slams germany
brussels july reuters president donald trump held talks with german chancellor angela merkel on the sidelines of a nato summit in brussels on wednesday hours after he fiercely criticised german policy on defence spending and gas imports from russia
the tone of their remarks when they jointly addressed reporters afterward appeared businesslike after trump had said germany s reliance on russian energy left it in the control of moscow and merkel later referred to her youth in east germany to insist berlin was now fully sovereign
we re having a great meeting

we have a very very good relationship with the chancellor
we have a tremendous relationship with germany he added saying he had raised his concerns about a new gas pipeline planned from russia to germany
merkel said she had discussed migration and trade with trump and looked forward to further exchanges as the united states remained a partner of germany
