update 2-opec sees lower 2019 demand for its oil, points to return of surplus
london reuters opec on wednesday forecast world demand for its crude will decline next year as growth in consumption slows and rivals pump more pointing to the return of an oil market surplus despite an pact to restrain supplies
giving its first forecasts in a monthly report the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said the world would need million barrels per day bpd of crude from its members next year down bpd from this year
the drop in demand for opec crude means there will be less strain on producers such as saudi arabia in making up for supply losses such as falling venezuelan and libyan output and an imminent drop in iranian exports as sanctions return
following the robust growth seen this year oil market developments are expected to slightly moderate in with the world economy and global oil demand forecasts to grow slightly less opec said in the report
oil topped a barrel this year for the first time since boosted by output cuts and involuntary supply losses
president donald trump has been urging saudi arabia and opec to raise output to cool prices
opec and a group of countries agreed on june to return to percent compliance with oil output cuts that began in january after months of underproduction by venezuela and others pushed adherence above percent
the strong pace of oil demand that helped opec balance the market is expected to wane next year
opec expects world oil demand to grow by million bpd down from million bpd in and said any upside could be accommodated
if the world economy performs better than expected leading to higher growth in crude oil demand opec will continue to have sufficient supply to support oil market stability opec said
oil prices maintained an earlier decline on wednesday after the release of the opec report trading around a barrel
in june opec oil output rose by bpd to million bpd largely due to higher saudi production the report said citing figures opec collects from secondary sources
this means compliance with the original deal has slipped to percent according to a reuters calculation meaning members are still cutting more than promised
opec s june output is bpd more than opec expects the demand for its oil to average next year suggesting a small surplus in the market should opec keep pumping the same amount and other things remain equal
still a drop in iranian exports could easily push the balance back to deficit
iranian news agency mehr citing figures from the state oil company said oil exports would drop by bpd with the restart of sanctions
and the higher prices that have followed the deal have prompted growth in rival supply and a surge of shale
opec expects supply to expand by million bpd next year far more than the expansion in world demand
next year s supply growth will be led by the united states with brazil and canada also contributing
but opec sees shale supply additions slowing in the second half of and into as bottlenecks persist
some of the planned pipeline capacity increases have been delayed and as a result the takeaway capacity issue could remain a major constraint until next winter opec said
