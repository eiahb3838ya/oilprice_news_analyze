u.s. csb continues metallurgical analysis in husky superior blast
houston july reuters the chemical safety board is analyzing metal blasted away from a unit at husky energy inc s superior wisconsin refinery as part of an probe of an april explosion the agency s acting executive said on wednesday
the shrapnel blown away from the fluidic catalytic cracking unit at the refinery tore through other refinery units including a tank containing hot asphalt which poured out in a wave of flame across the refinery said kristen kulinowski the board s interim executive
the risk of further explosions forced most of superior s residents to evacuate for hours
the metallurgical analysis is proceeding slowly kulinowski said
it s a painstaking process as much of the metal is covered with asphalt she said
the superior refinery has remained shut since the explosion
like the national transportation safety board the csb has no regulatory or enforcement authority but recommends changes in industry practices and regulations based on its investigations
