update 1-trump changes tone in merkel meeting after earlier slamming germany
updates with more quotes brussels july reuters president donald trump said he had a great meeting with german chancellor angela merkel on the sidelines of a nato summit on wednesday hours after he fiercely criticised german policy on defence spending and gas imports from russia
the tone of their remarks contrasted with an earlier breakfast between trump and nato chief jens stoltenberg when the republican president said germany s reliance on russian energy left it in the control of moscow and merkel later referred to her youth in east germany to insist berlin was now fully sovereign
we re having a great meeting
we re discussing military expenditure talking about trade trump told reporters who were allowed in to the meeting room
we have a very very good relationship with the chancellor
we have a tremendous relationship with germany he added saying he had raised his concerns about a new gas pipeline planned from russia to germany
trump played up the success of the bilateral meeting and the potential to resolve issues
i believe that our trade will increase and lots of other things will increase but we ll see what merkel speaking through an interpreter said the meeting was an opportunity to have an exchange about economic developments and also the future of our trade merkel said it was very important to have such exchanges like the meeting she and trump were having because after all we are partners
we are good partners and we wish to continue to cooperate in the reporting by jeff mason writing by alastair macdonald and robin emmott editing by bartunek
