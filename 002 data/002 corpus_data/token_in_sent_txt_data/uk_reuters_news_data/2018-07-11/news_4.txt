update 2-epa's acting head vows to carry out trump's regulation cuts
washington reuters the environmental protection agency s acting chief said on wednesday he would push to cut regulations on industry and speed up decisions on permits echoing the policies of former head scott pruitt who stepped down last week
andrew wheeler a longtime washington insider took the reins on monday after pruitt a former attorney general from oklahoma resigned over more than a dozen ethics controversies
unlike pruitt wheeler has been known to shun the spotlight
but some environmentalists say his experience means he can carry out trump s policy of slashing regulations more effectively
wheeler said president donald trump talked to him last week and asked him to provide regulatory relief to industry while protecting air and water quality
i think we can do all three of those things at the same time wheeler said in his first address to epa staff
environmentalists have complained that the epa under trump has worked to reverse obama era limits on pollution
wheeler worked at the epa in the and later in the senate under senator jim inhofe a skeptic of mainstream climate science before moving to the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant
he said that he was not at all ashamed of more recent lobbying for the coal company murray energy corp the focus of criticism by environmentalists
his top issue in work for murray was the miners protection act shoring up pension and healthcare benefits for united mine worker retirees said wheeler whose grandfather was a coal miner during the great depression
robert murray the company s chief executive has pressured the trump administration to ease regulations on mining
wheeler also lobbied for energy interests including utility xcel energy inc bears head lng
he also consulted for biofuels industry group growth energy agricultural merchant and biofuels producer archer daniels midland and international paper according to his public financial disclosures
the epa will prioritize cleaning up industrial superfund sites and financing investments in water infrastructure wheeler said continuing pruitt s goal of bringing the agency back to wheeler also pledged to speed up permitting setting a goal of issuing decisions on all permits before the agency in six months
he said this would ease uncertainty for small businesses
left unmentioned was pruitt s final move at the agency to undo rules on refurbished trucks known as gliders which environmentalists say generate as much as times the pollution of modern engines
like pruitt wheeler believes the epa in the previous administration of barack obama overstepped federal clean air law by issuing rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions
wheeler who had been confirmed by the senate to serve as pruitt s deputy will deal with issues including replacing the clean power plan requirements of biofuels mixed into gasoline and diesel and whether the epa chief has a role in promoting exports
on monday after pressure from industry for regulatory certainty the epa sent a rule to reduce greenhouse emissions from power plants to the white house s office of management and budget for review
it is expected to be more industry friendly than the clean power plan
the epa will open the rule to public comment after the omb reviews it
it is not yet known if trump will nominate wheeler to replace pruitt permanently if he does the senate would again have to confirm him
