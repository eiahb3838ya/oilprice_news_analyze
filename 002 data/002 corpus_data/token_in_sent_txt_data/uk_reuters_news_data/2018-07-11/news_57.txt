melbourne reuters the float of viva energy led by global energy trader vitol has been priced at the bottom of an indicated range valuing the australian oil refiner and marketer at a billion billion pounds two fund managers said on wednesday
the viva energy initial public offering australia s biggest in nearly four years follows a strong pick up in ipos in the first half of this year that marked the busiest period for australian issuers since early
viva s ipo was priced at a a share the sources said on condition of anonymity as the details were not public
institutions had been asked to bid within a and a
the company declined to comment
it is likely to announce on thursday the pricing and how much stake the partnership will retain in viva upon listing
the shares will debut on the australian stock exchange on friday
viva energy was built from royal dutch shell s former refinery in geelong near melbourne and a network of about petrol stations in australia that vitol bought in a billion deal in
vitol and its unnamed partners have since spent over a billion improving the business including buying shell s jet fuel operations in australia and are now looking to cash in
fund managers who took part in the viva ipo run by bank of america merrill lynch deutsche bank and ubs said it was reasonably priced and appeared to have received good demand
it s a good company
the industry dynamics are favourable and it s run by a capable management team said an analyst with a fund manager
ahead of the ipo launch last month institutional investors had committed to buy about a billion worth of viva shares which at a apiece would be half the stock on offer
however some fund managers said while the viva ipo was more attractive than other recent floats by private vendors such as spotless they did not see much growth in the business or preferred viva s rival caltex australia
it s kind of
for that there are better opportunities elsewhere said john grace portfolio manager at ausbil dexia
at a a share viva would be priced at times forecast net profit for the year to june just a slight discount to caltex that is trading on a forward earnings multiple of according to thomson reuters data
one factor that fund managers preferred in caltex was that it owned its petrol station sites unlike viva energy
vitol spun off viva s sites into a listed property trust viva energy reit last year reaping the benefit for itself
shareholders in caltex stand to gain similar benefits if caltex were to spin off its sites into a property trust
