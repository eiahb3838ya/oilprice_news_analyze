focus-u.s.-china trade row helped basf land $10 bln guangdong chemicals coup -sources
beijing reuters germany s basf managed to wrap up a preliminary deal to build china s first wholly chemicals complex quite quickly aided in part by trade tensions between beijing and washington sources with knowledge of the matter said
the proposed complex worth some billion in investment to will be located in guangdong china s most populous province which had been worried about the impact of a decision to heavily penalize telecom firm zte corp also based there
fears that a trade war would hurt investment prospects for the province made local government officials that much more receptive to overtures by basf a global giant with art technology separate people briefed on matter also said
basf s announcement part of billion worth of bilateral deals unveiled as german chancellor angela merkel met chinese premier li keqiang in berlin this week is conspicuous for its timing trade and chemical industry experts said
in reaching out to europe china is showing it is open for business as the trade row with washington deepens
basf s coup while still a rare example of a foreign player prising open the chinese government s tight control over its energy and chemical industries also follows measures by beijing to lift some caps on foreign ownership in the auto and banking sectors
now that we have this trade war that was kicked off last week beijing is telling washington that it is still doing business and that there are capable companies around the world to do business with said john driscoll director of consultancy jtd energy in singapore
the outcomes of li s visit during which the widow of chinese nobel peace political dissident liu xiaobo left de facto house arrest in china to live in germany signaled a measured warming in what has been a bilateral relationship fraught with spying allegations and commercial mistrust
china this week has also approved a huge new wholly owned shanghai factory for electric car maker tesla inc and a billion joint venture organic diode oled plant to be built by south korea s lg display co ltd
in contrast the trump administration on tuesday raised the stakes in the trade dispute threatening percent tariffs on a list of billion worth of chinese imports prompting beijing to warn it would be forced to retaliate
basf s search for a potential site for its second major project in the world s largest chemical market had been in the works for a while an industry insider with knowledge of the deal said
like other sources the industry insider declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter
the german firm had decided to go it alone rather than working with a partner as it had done previously and chose guangdong as recently as three months ago the person said adding basf had spied a window of opportunity banking on the province s desire for technology
the person also said local governments had become more aware that they can not not own everything and foreign investment could help them build what they wanted
basf s overtures coincided with a crisis for zte slapped with a ban barring suppliers from selling it components after the firm broke an agreement to discipline executives who conspired to evade sanctions on iran and north korea
zte has had to curtail operations and is working to lift the ban
the zte case helped the person said on tuesday without elaborating further
basf s media relations department said the company chose guangdong for its first major investment in south china to tap the region s fast economic growth and declined to comment on whether zte s travails had helped speed up the
amid china s increased openness to foreign investment basf s knowledge of doing business in china meant it could seize the right opportunity at the right time a energy industry executive said
under the agreement basf will explore building an integrated chemicals complex with petrochemicals plants and a steam cracker producing million tonnes per year of ethylene
it is a chance to greatly expand in a chinese chemicals market worth an estimated trillion a year feeding plastics coatings and adhesives to the southern province s consumer electronics and automotive sectors
by contrast rival petrochemical giants have yet to strike wholly owned deals in china which accounts for around percent of the world s chemical production
so far they ve stuck with joint ventures even though china eased restrictions on foreign ownership in the sector in
royal dutch shell started an expanded joint venture petrochemical plant in huizhou in may with china national offshore oil corporation cnooc
exxon mobil late last year signed a joint study memorandum of understanding with the government of huizhou for a similar facility although that agreement allows for the possibility of full ownership
basf plans to do a study of its site by the end of the year followed by a thorough analysis by with construction estimated to start in
the company aims to complete the first plants by
basf s first major foray in china nearly two decades ago was a joint venture with state oil major sinopec to build a billion petrochemical complex in nanjing jiangsu province
