the lawsuits were filed on monday with the district court in newark new jersey and on wednesday after market hours with the district court in manhattan

glencore did not immediately respond after market hours on wednesday to requests for comment
chief executive ivan glasenberg is a defendant in both lawsuits and chief financial officer steven kalmin is a defendant in the new jersey lawsuit

on wednesday glencore said it would cooperate with the justice department and had set up a board committee including chairman and former bp plc chief executive tony hayward to oversee its response
some analysts have said the subpoena might have resulted from glencore s settling of a mining dispute in congo with israeli billionaire dan gertler under sanctions since last year by agreeing to pay royalties in euros
analysts have said congo accounts for about percent of glencore s net present value
