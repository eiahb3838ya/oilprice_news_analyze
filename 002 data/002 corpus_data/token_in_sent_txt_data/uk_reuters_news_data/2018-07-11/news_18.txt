epa scraps detailed plan to force u.s. refiners to blend more biofuels
new york reuters the environmental protection agency ditched a detailed plan that would have forced refiners to blend more biofuels into their gasoline and diesel in to compensate for volumes likely to be exempted under the agency s small refinery hardship waiver program according to newly released epa documents
the plan would have boosted the renewable fuel blending obligation for the refining industry to percent from percent to offset volumes lost under the waiver program which has been expanded sharply under president donald trump s epa and keep overall blended volumes on target
the idea was aimed at assuaging the powerful corn lobby which has accused trump s epa of undermining demand for biofuels like ethanol through the waiver program but was scrapped amid intense protest from the refining industry
what this shows is the epa acknowledges it has the authority and the ability to reallocate the volumes lost under the small refinery exemption program geoff cooper an executive at the renewable fuels association said on wednesday
the epa said the documents reflect the agency s process for administering the renewable fuel standard rfs which is done in conjunction with the departments of energy and agriculture as well as the white house
the move would have likely rallied compliance credit prices that have plunged to lows amid reports of the agency s expansion of the waiver program
under the rfs the epa must set annual requirements for the volume of renewable fuels that oil refiners and other fuel companies must blend with their products
the policy has been a source of contention between powerful corn and oil lobbies in washington
the agency also has the power to exempt smaller refineries from the blending requirements if they can prove that complying with the regulation would cause them financial stress
the epa under director scott pruitt has roughly tripled the number of exemptions granted to small refiners angering midwest farmers and their legislative backers who say he effectively lowered the annual biofuels mandate
exemptions representing some million gallons worth of biofuel were granted for and according to the epa
that includes waivers covering million compliance credits called rins in the epa said
under the scrapped plan the epa would have estimated the number of gallons of gasoline and diesel that would likely be exempted in under the small refinery waiver program and force the larger refineries to make up the difference
the epa projected some billion gallons of gasoline and billion gallons of diesel produced by small refiners would be exempt from the requirements in the documents showed
the documents were published by the epa as part of requirements aimed at providing the public more insight into federal decision making
reuters and other news outlets reported on the epa s volumes proposal but the documents provide new details about the agency s approach
the proposed changes came in a june email from tia sutton of the epa to the white house office of management and budget
pruitt who resigned amid ethics scandals last week had just returned from a midwest tour where he met with farmers angry over his expansion of the exemption program
a day later some legal justification was added to the proposed rule stating this approach is consistent with the text of our regulations which accounts for the amount of gasoline and amount of diesel projected to be produced by exempt small refineries in refiners learned of the changes and made a press to the agency and white house to reverse it
senators ted cruz of texas and pat toomey of pennsylvania both republicans had calls with pruitt a day after reports of the changes circulated according to pruitt s public schedule
on june the epa struck the changes in a new email to the omb office the documents showed
the final proposed rule was published on june
