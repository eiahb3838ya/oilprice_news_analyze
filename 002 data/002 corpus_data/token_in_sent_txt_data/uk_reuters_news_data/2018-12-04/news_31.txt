public anger as air pollution in western balkan cities worsens
sarajevo reuters when winter arrives in the western balkans it is not unusual for dense smog to envelop its cities making it hard to breathe and impairing visibility
but this year pollution levels are among the highest in the world and public anger is on the rise
in recent days the bosnian macedonian and kosovar capitals topped the charts of the world s most polluted cities as the smog intensified due to heavy traffic excessive use of coal poor spatial planning and solid fuel based heating
the air quality index measured by the embassy in sarajevo hit on tuesday a level identified by the world health organization who as hazardous to health and almost ten times the average
in pristina the index registered on monday night and marked air quality in several macedonian towns as very poor
this is all the result of a situation in which political elites treat the city as a construction plot which should be occupied at all costs rather than a place where people live anes podic of sarajevo s eko akcija environmental group said
you can feel how bad the air smells even inside the car or home said a taxi driver mirsad pobric
according to the who pollution costs bosnia the equivalent of more than a fifth of its annual gross domestic product gdp every year around billion in lost work and school days healthcare and fuel costs
macedonia loses an equivalent of percent of gdp a year to pollution the world bank said in a report more than million a year
as a way of bringing more attention to the issue the embassy of sweden has been using red lighting on its facade in central sarajevo to reflect air quality each day
the deeper the red the worse the pollution
according to the who bosnians die of air pollution per citizens a year compared to in sweden
the world bank estimates that in macedonia there are deaths related to air pollution per year
pollution is killing people of bosnia and herzegovina therefore something really needs to be done swedish ambassador anders hagelberg told reuters
as part of efforts to combat the issue sweden has launched a project in bosnia that will bring together experts from its environmental protection agency and local agencies and governments
the aim of the program is to help improve air quality monitoring but also to bring more investment into energy efficiency
macedonia has launched its own program to combat air pollution to which the government allocated million euros million in next year s budget
it aims to halve skopje s air pollution within two years by reducing taxes for central heating restricting traffic and introducing stricter control of industrial emissions
activists say the funds allocated are insufficient and that the government s response is inadequate
