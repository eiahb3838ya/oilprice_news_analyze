internal feud shakes french sugar group tereos as markets plunge
dec reuters french cooperative tereos the world s second largest sugar maker is holding extraordinary elections to its membership council this week which the group hopes will end an internal feud at the group already struggling with an slump
a sharp fall in sugar prices in the european union has triggered a crisis in the industry that has also hit rivals such as suedzucker nordzucker and associated british foods
for tereos the impact of low sugar prices has been particularly harsh due to the company s heavy debt burden and deep exposure to sugar
tereos posted a loss last season and is likely to record another in weighed down by its european sugar activities chief executive alexis duval told reuters
as concern over tereos financial situation grew among its members out of elected members of the council of regions quit over the summer to protest at management strategy
council members are designated by cooperative members to represent them at tereos general assembly
the group said this week s elections to replace them with results expected on wednesday were an opportunity for unity after months of public wrangling
make no mistake the temptation to pit tereos people and regions against each other and the chimera to turn in upon ourselves are deadly poisons for our cooperative francois leroux chairman of tereos supervisory board told cooperative members in a letter last week
tereos held regional meetings in october to answer cooperative members concerns fueled by two anonymous letters about the group s critical financial condition and an internal rebellion by three resigning board members
the company has been under pressure to reduce its billion euro billion debt burden and boost cash as it looks to offset losses from its sugar operations which account for nearly half of revenues with the rest mostly from ethanol starch and sweeteners
tereos has been growing a lot but it was mostly funded by internal cash flows or from debt
because as a cooperative they can not raise equity said maxime puget director at s p global ratings which rates tereos bonds
they have high levels of debt due to previous acquisitions and they have never been able to and that s their tereos said in june it was considering selling a minority stake to help it continue growing abroad and diversifying its activities
it is due to unveil initial details of its capital increase around spring next year
tereos fast expansion notably in brazil where it is the third largest sugar maker has left many of its french sugar beet farmers frustrated because they have received little return from it
we feel we need to change strategy away from internationalisation and expansion at all costs because that s where debt came from benoit mazure a grower in the beauce region south of paris
three former members of tereos supervisory board voiced strong concern about the group s future over the summer asking for more details and transparency
they were expelled from the cooperative for defamation in august a move seen as extreme by many members
in protest the dissidents launched a petition in september they say gathered over votes to request an extraordinary general meeting
reflection about the group s future has been seriously slowed down by this fight said a senior tereos employee who asked not to be named
plus it doesn t make the group very attractive for a capital industry sources told reuters that a representative of tereos supervisory board had approached germany s nordzucker this summer to potentially seek capital through a
tereos denied that the supervisory or the management board had contacted the german company
nordzucker declined to comment
tereos has not contacted potential investors who can participate in this project today
neither directly nor indirectly
because we will have to do some study first and because it is a project for the future
there is no rush duval said
european sugar companies profits have plunged as world sugar prices fell to their lowest in a decade this year amid a surge in supplies partly driven by more output from the eu after it scrapped export and output quotas last year

germany s suedzucker the world s leading sugar maker slashed its earnings forecast on expectations that sugar prices will fail to recover in the
the group however carries less debt and as a publicly listed company has been able to raise cash through equity markets
sources with knowledge of the company say it is unlikely tereos will find a partner or go public until sugar prices rebound significantly
sugar was trading at a tonne on tuesday morning up percent from the low touched in august but still well below the traded at the same time in
with sugar prices at or we would not be in the mess we are today said etienne clabaut one of the tereos supervisory board members who left in july
