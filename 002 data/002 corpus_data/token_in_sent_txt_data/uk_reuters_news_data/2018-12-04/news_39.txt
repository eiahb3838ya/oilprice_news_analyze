special report-wall street cleans up on 'clean' coal subsidies
reuters earlier this year the chief financial officer of global insurance giant arthur gallagher explained to analysts how the company had turned a energy subsidy into a profit machine worth hundreds of millions of dollars to its bottom line
the money came from the clean coal tax credit a provision of the american jobs act of meant to encourage the use of chemically treated coal to cut pollution in the nation s power plants
to capitalise on the subsidy
gallagher arranged investor partnerships to produce vast quantities of refined coal as the fuel is known in the industry for utilities across the nation splitting the benefit of the lucrative government incentive now worth more than pounds per ton
our return on investment is staggering cfo douglas howell told analysts in the march call
oh percent percent percent percent
i mean just because it costs so little to develop clean coal facilities

gallagher s experience reflects a truth about the refined coal tax credit a subsidy that now costs taxpayers about billion a year while coal mining firms utility companies and power consumers can benefit indirectly from the subsidy the big winners are a diverse group of investors ranging from wall street s most powerful banks to insurers meat packers and drug makers who identified the incentive as an easy way to make money
over the past decade these companies have financed the construction of facilities to produce refined coal which are situated next to power plants and typically cost about million to million each to develop
they then sell the resulting coal to utilities below cost but make returns from the subsidy rather than the underlying business according to regulatory documents and interviews

gallagher s howell took credit for designing a business model to maximize profits from the subsidy in his march call with analysts
it is our machine he said
we developed it
we pioneered the company has accumulated about million worth of tax credits mostly from its side business in refined coal howell said on an conference call with investors and analysts
and at current production levels of refined coal he said that may total another million through howell declined to comment for this story

gallagher spokeswoman linda collins minimized the importance of clean coal to the company
refined coal is not a part of our core brokerage and risk management business collins said in an email
refined coal activities however accounted for percent of the company s billion in total revenue during the first nine months of this year according to aj gallagher financial statements
they also made up about a fifth of the company s million in net earnings attributable to controlling interests during that period
while the subsidy has proven a boon for investors it has often failed to achieve the intended reductions of nitrogen oxides or nox the primary contributor to smog and acid rain
utilities that burn refined coal have trailed competitors burning raw coal in lowering nox emissions and of plants burning refined coal have seen nox emission rates rise instead of fall according to a reuters analysis of epa emissions data vetted by industry experts
the refined coal tax subsidy is scheduled to expire in
but lawmakers including republican senator john hoeven of north dakota have introduced legislation to extend it another years
they argue it helps the environment extends the life of the ailing coal industry a centrepiece of the trump administration s energy policy and reduces power prices by giving utilities a cheap subsidized source of coal
this is really an incentive to operate in a way that s more environmentally friendly while keeping power costs low said hoeven whose state sits atop an supply of lignite coal
if the extension goes through those best placed to gain from the subsidy are an eclectic list of refined coal investors including wall street banks goldman sachs group inc jpmorgan chase co inc and capital one financial corp wealth management giant fidelity investments drugmaker mylan nv affiliates of global commodities trader noble group ltd industrial supplier grainger inc pork producer seaboard corp and ethanol plant investor rex american resources corp according to disclosures with the securities and exchange commission state environmental regulators and the tax court
capitalone goldman sachs jpmorgan mylan noble rex american seaboard and grainger declined to comment on refined coal s impact on nox pollution
these and other refined coal investors stand to gain at least billion in tax incentives over the next decade if the law is extended based on the current annual consumption of refined coal and the existing level of the tax credit
as originally drawn in the refined coal tax credit required producers to increase raw coal s market value by percent to qualify for the subsidy
the clause made utilities unwilling to buy the specialized product
prospects for the clean coal business were dim
but in the wake of the financial crisis two senators changed the landscape by deleting the clause a subtle tweak tucked away in the massive billion financial rescue package

gallagher along with utility firms ameren corp and dte energy also had been lobbying on the issue of refined coal according to lobbying disclosure filings though it is unclear if they lobbied specifically on the clause
officials at ameren and dte declined to comment on the lobbying
the policy edit by democrat max baucus of coal mining state montana and republican chuck grassley of iowa made it possible for refined coal producers to receive the subsidy even if they sold their product to utilities below cost
that paved the way for investors to set up operations and to ultimately make billions of dollars building refined coal to its current share of about a fifth of the coal market
baucus said he does not remember the change to the refined coal tax credit
it was a blizzard a deluge of credits was being discussed baucus said
it s very easy to change the code to give credit to companies to spur investment
the code gets crusted with barnacles of credits and then they re removed
it s the natural ebb and flow of grassley declined to comment for this story
the subsidy is now worth more than a ton an amount that covers losses on the discounted pricing and the operations that produce refined coal while often leaving a profit that can amount to tens or hundreds of millions of dollars per year per investor according to disclosures by tax credit investors
because some of the operating expenses of running a refined coal facility are deductible the tax credit s effective value can top a ton
goldman sachs one of the world s most powerful banks is currently generating estimated annual gross tax credits of about million from two missouri power plants alone according data from the energy information administration showing refined coal consumption patterns at the plants
goldman declined to comment
it was virtually impossible to make money producing clean coal for utilities said roger jones senior counsel at mcdermott will emery llp in chicago who has represented refined coal tax investors
but as soon as the credit was there people thought about to engage in this after the tax credit was revised
gallagher led the race to build refined coal facilities constructing them next to power plants that burned the most coal in the country so as to maximize credit volumes
it now has investments in refined coal facilities in the united states along with a percent controlling stake in llc a leading supplier of chemicals used to refine raw coal according to
gallagher sec filings
gallagher s main rival advanced emissions solutions inc holds interests in refined coal facilities with tax credit investors through a joint venture with goldman sachs and nexgen resources affiliates of goldman sachs account for most of those investors sec filings show
goldman sachs in purchased a percent stake in the joint venture a refined coal operator called tinuum group llc formerly known as clean coal solutions for million
advanced emissions owns a percent stake in tinuum whose operations produced and sold about million tons of refined coal during the period that ended sec disclosures show
some partnerships include players even farther afield from the energy business
in one of refined coal s earliest and biggest financial commitments trash collector waste management inc teamed up with jpmorgan chase to invest in the refined coal facility at coal creek station in north dakota
the bank and the trash company invested in a facility that treats coal by preheating it in a process that dries out several million tons of soggy lignite coal each year increasing its energy output
electric cooperative great river energy the owner of the plant agreed to lease its refined coal facility to jpmorgan and waste management for million over years according to a january deal disclosed by the
jpmorgan and waste management declined to comment for this story
another big beneficiary is drug maker mylan
refined coal tax credits were the second biggest component in producing a tax benefit of million in according to mylan s annual report
that tax benefit lifted its consolidated earnings for the year to million from million
power plant owners typically sell their coal at cost to refined coal operations controlled by tax credit investors
once the coal is treated with chemicals or dried out at an refined coal facility the tax credit investors sell the coal back to the power plants at a discount that can be anywhere from cents to per ton a way to ensure utilities get some benefit from the subsidy according to agreements filed with state regulators
coal which has high energy content for power generation costs about a ton
coal plant owners also may structure deals with refined coal producers to collect and licensing fees or to charge rent through leases of their land used for the facilities the disclosures show
last year louisville gas electric and kentucky utilities a unit of ppl corp struck a deal with an affiliate of goldman sachs to burn refined coal at the utility s ghent power station
the utility stands to receive million a year in incentives and would bear no expense for running the refined coal operations according to disclosures with kentucky regulators
for goldman and any other tax credit investors in the deal the gross annual tax credit before refined coal operating expenses and incentives for the utility is million reuters estimates
that estimate is based on ghent s average annual coal consumption of million tons multiplied by the per ton tax credit
goldman declined to comment on the revenue or profit it derives from tax credits
utility companies themselves haven t been in the vanguard of capitalizing on the refined coal subsidy
that s because the original wording of the refined coal tax credit passed in stipulated that the producer of refined coal had to sell it to an unrelated so utilities couldn t invest in clean coal and sell it to themselves
the irs issued new guidance in however that opened the door for affiliates of utilities like dte energy to control or take stakes in refined coal production facilities in recent years
dte has received some million in refined coal tax credits since sec disclosures show
dte declined to comment for this story
in today s thriving clean coal industry
gallagher s early moves to monetize the tax credit seem prescient
months before the subsidy first entered the tax code in the company paid for a percent ownership stake in which at the time was developing chemical treatments designed to reduce coal pollution
a core group of five people at
gallagher was overseeing the move into the business according to the company s disclosures to investors

gallagher was among several investors who paid washington firms to lobby on refined coal according to lobbying disclosure filings
in before congress modified the refined coal tax credit to erase the clause the company paid two law firms winston strawn and steptoe johnson to lobby on refined coal and energy and tax issues respectively
the lobbying disclosure documents do not detail what specific objective the companies had in their lobbying activities
officials from those law firms involved in the lobbying declined to comment
david lowman a partner at hunton andrews kurth llp was lobbying on refined coal on behalf of a different company at the time
he said the refined coal industry successfully pushed to have the market value clause eliminated
in return the industry agreed to double the pollution reduction requirement on mercury and sulphur dioxide to percent from percent
by the end of gallagher had built up a percent stake in for a total investment of million according to company disclosures
now it was ready to launch into developing facilities
the dive into a newly subsidized business was part of the company s strategy to find profits in incentives
dating to the arthur gallagher has sought out opportunities for example in subsidized housing and the synfuel tax credit designed to promote synthetic fuels that can reduce import dependence
gallagher s approach to refined coal however has made it a heavyweight and it has been pivotal in recruiting tax investors to help finance refined coal operations throughout the country
in it negotiated partnerships with fidelity and the subsidiary of france s schneider electric se to produce refined coal for a utility at three south carolina power plants tax court disclosures show
gallagher also has struck deals to put refined coal operations inside the fence of power plants owned by dte and utility ameren corp
net earnings from its clean energy investments are estimated to be million in or times more than what the company reported in
looking ahead the company can carry forward its stockpile of million in credits to reduce its taxes in future years
we will not be paying much if any federal income tax for many years to come cfo howell said this spring during a conference call with investors
