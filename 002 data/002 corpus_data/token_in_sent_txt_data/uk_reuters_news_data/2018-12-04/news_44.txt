opec works on deal to cut output, still needs russia on board
vienna dec reuters opec and its allies are working towards a deal to reduce oil output by at least million barrels per day four sources said adding that russia s resistance to a significant production cut was so far the main stumbling block
opec meets on thursday in vienna followed by talks with allies such as russia on friday amid a drop in crude prices caused by global economic weakness and concerns about an oil glut due largely to a rise in production
the producer group s de facto leader saudi arabia has indicated a need for steep reductions in output from january but has come under pressure from president donald trump to help support the world economy with lower oil prices
possibly complicating any opec decision is the crisis around the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul in october
trump has backed saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman despite calls from many politicians to impose stiff sanctions on riyadh
the sources three from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and one from a producer said the meeting was taking place in a difficult environment and that russia s position would be key in reaching a deal
russia is playing tough one of the opec sources said
russian sources have indicated the country could contribute some bpd to a reduction but middle opec insists moscow cut by bpd
two opec sources said talks were focusing on a cut of percent from october output levels with no exemptions for any member
until those main criteria are met opec could endure a fall in oil prices for a while if it opted to delay a decision on a cut for a month or two one of the sources said
opec can always meet again in february and decide on a cut then
those who were not able or willing to cooperate will be wanting to cut then the source added
qatar said on monday it would quit opec to focus on gas in a swipe at saudi arabia which is trying to show unity in tackling the slide in oil prices
