column-winter is looking a little weird for china's commodities: russell
launceston australia reuters the northern winter usually leads to a demand and price peak for several major commodities in asia but this year is bucking the trend for coal liquefied natural gas lng and iron ore
there doesn t appear to be one single driving narrative causing the break with the usual seasonal patterns rather a variety of unrelated or loosely related factors are at work but with china as a common thread
lng provides the most stark example with the spot asian price actually weakening at a time when it is usually strengthening
it dropped to per million british thermal units mmbtu in the week to the weakest since late july
spot lng has in the past few years exhibited a strong and reliable seasonal pattern in asia rising to a before slackening into summer
the peak so far in has been in summer when lng reached per mmbtu in june above the prior of from
lng has been influenced by a variety of factors with summer prices rising because of demand for cooling amid weather and some supply issues including an outage at malaysia s bintalu project
the winter price surge hasn t happened largely because china the world s lng importer and a major driver of winter demand is not experiencing the same demand surge as it did last year
in chinese demand for lng soared as the country moved sharply to cut back on the use of coal for residential heating over winter amid efforts to mitigate air pollution
however this winter china appears to have prepared more thoroughly building up natural gas inventories and being more cautious in the amount of switching being undertaken
a winter so far in north asia has also limited demand for spot cargoes from major buyers such as japan and south korea
in coal the experienced since the price recovery started in has been absent in part because of the warmer weather but also because of moves in china to restrict imports
the price of thermal coal at australia s newcastle port as assessed by argus media was a tonne in the week ended
while this was up a touch from the low of a tonne the prior week it s still well below the peak of reached in
in common with lng china the world s biggest coal importer appears to be playing a role in keeping the polluting fuel from enjoying a
chinese trading companies said the authorities in beijing have indicated that coal imports are to be wound back for december as part of efforts to keep imports for around the same level as
that will be difficult as imports for the first months of at million tonnes were already within spitting distance of the total of million for the whole of
china s coal utilities have plentiful inventories for winter amid rising domestic production and it s believed the authorities are prioritising the consumption of local supplies
iron ore is another commodity that usually enjoys a strong run in the northern winter albeit usually toward the tail end as chinese steel mills start to ahead of the summer peak demand for steel
this year iron ore peaked in late february with the grade as assessed by argus media reaching a tonne on
but the steelmaking ingredient may have already reached its having hit on and subsequently dropping sharply to a low of on
it has recovered somewhat since then to a tonne on monday but that was most likely because commodities in general got a boost from news of the trade dispute ceasefire between president donald trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping
iron ore is declining in tandem with chinese steel prices which have been suffering because of a poorer demand outlook and still strong production
whether iron ore can stage a late winter rally will likely be dependent on whether the market takes the view that china s infrastructure and construction spending look positive for
overall it appears that without any deliberate policy moves china has disrupted the normal season pattern for some of its major commodity imports
this is perhaps an important reminder that the world s biggest buyer of natural resources can make commodities dance to its tune even without really trying
