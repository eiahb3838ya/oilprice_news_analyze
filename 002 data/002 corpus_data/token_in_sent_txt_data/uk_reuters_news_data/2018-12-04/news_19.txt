update 5-macron makes u-turn on fuel-tax increases in face of "yellow vest" protests
paris reuters france s prime minister on tuesday suspended planned increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent protests the first major by president emmanuel macron s administration in months in office
in announcing the decision prime minister edouard philippe said anyone would have to be deaf or blind not to see or hear the roiling anger on the streets over a policy that macron has defended as critical to combating climate change
the french who have donned yellow vests want taxes to drop and work to pay
that s also what we want
if i didn t manage to explain it if the ruling majority didn t manage to convince the french then something must change said philippe
no tax is worth jeopardising the unity of the along with the delay to the tax increases that were set for january philippe said the time would be used to discuss other measures to help the working poor and squeezed who rely on vehicles to get to work and go shopping
earlier officials had hinted at a possible increase to the minimum wage but philippe made no such commitment
he warned citizens however that they could not expect better public services and lower taxes
if the events of recent days have shown us one thing it s that the french want neither an increase in taxes or new taxes
if the falls then spending must fall because we don t want to pass our debts on to our children
and those debts are already sizeable he said
the measures will cost around billion euros billion but will be offset by corresponding spending cuts a government source said
the yellow vest movement which started on as a protest group named for the jackets all motorists in france carry in their cars began with the aim of highlighting the squeeze on household spending brought about by macron s taxes on fuel
however over the past three weeks the movement has evolved into a wider broadbrush uprising with many criticising the president for pursuing policies they say favour the rich and do nothing to help the poor
despite having no leader and sometimes unclear goals the movement has drawn people of all ages and backgrounds and tapped into a growing malaise over macron s leadership
over the past two days ambulance drivers and students have joined in and launched their own protests
two unions cgt and fo called lorry drivers to start a strike from december while several facebook pages were also urging new rounds of demonstrations for next saturday
after three weeks of rising frustration there was scant indication philippe s measures would placate the yellow vests who themselves are struggling to find a unified position
the french don t want crumbs they want a baguette yellow vest spokesman benjamin cauchy told bfm adding that the movement wanted a cancellation of the taxes
another one christophe chalencon was more blunt we re being taken for idiots he told reuters using a stronger expletive
the timing of the tax is uncomfortable for macron
it comes as governments meet in poland to try to agree measures to avert the most damaging consequences of global warming an issue macron has made a central part of his agenda
his carbon taxes were designed to address the issue
but the scale of the protests against his policies made it almost impossible to plough ahead
while the yellow vest movement was mostly peaceful to begin with the past two weekends have seen outpourings of violence and rioting in paris with extreme and factions joining the demos
on saturday the arc de triomphe national monument was defaced and avenues off the champs elysees were damaged
cars buildings and some cafes were torched
the unrest is estimated to have cost the economy millions with disruption to retailers wholesalers the restaurant and hotel trades
in some areas manufacturing has been hit in the run up to christmas
macron a former investment banker and economy minister came to office in promising to overhaul the economy revitalise growth and draw foreign investment by making the nation a more attractive place to do business
in the process he earned the tag president of the rich for seeming to do more to court big business and ease the tax burden on the wealthy
discontent has steadily risen among workers and others who feel he represents an urban elite
for macron who is sharply down in the polls and struggling to regain the initiative a further risk is how opposition parties leverage the anger and the decision to shift course
ahead of european parliament elections next may support for the under marine le pen and the of melenchon has been rising
macron has cast those elections as a battle between his progressive ideas and what he sees as their promotion of nationalist or agendas
le pen was quick to point out that the postponement of the increases took the decision beyond the european elections
