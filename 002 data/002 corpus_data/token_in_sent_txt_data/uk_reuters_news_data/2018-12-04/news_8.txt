update 5-opec works on deal to cut output, still needs russia on board
vienna reuters opec and its allies are working towards a deal this week to reduce oil output by at least million barrels per day four sources said adding that russia s resistance to a major cut was so far the main stumbling block
opec meets on thursday in vienna followed by talks with allies such as russia on friday amid a drop in crude prices caused by global economic weakness and fears of an oil glut due largely to a rise in production
the producer group s de facto leader saudi arabia has indicated a need for steep reductions in output from january but has come under pressure from president donald trump to help support the world economy with lower oil prices
possibly complicating any opec decision is the crisis around the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul in october
trump has backed saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman despite calls from many politicians to impose stiff sanctions on riyadh
the sources three from the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries and one from a producer said the meetings were taking place in a difficult environment and that russia s position would be key in reaching a deal
russia is playing tough one of the opec sources said
another opec source said the saudis are working hard on the cut
but if russia says no cut then we opec won t the saudi and united arab emirates energy ministers khalid and suhail bin mohammed said on tuesday that an adjustment in global oil output was required but all producers must be on board
the next road to cross is whether all countries are willing to come on board and contribute to that cut falih told bloomberg television
russian sources have indicated moscow could contribute some bpd to a reduction but middle opec insists russia cut by bpd
two sources said talks were focussing on a cut of percent from october output levels with no exemptions for any member
sources also said opec could delay a decision to cut if the main criteria such as russia s involvement were not met even though doing so would mean a further fall in prices
opec can always meet again in february for example and decide on a cut then
those who were not able or willing to cooperate will be wanting to cut then one source said
saudi arabia previously insisted on a need to reduce production
it was unclear whether the apparent shift in position was caused by opec using negotiation tactics to bring russia on board or by pressure from trump to refrain from cutting output
