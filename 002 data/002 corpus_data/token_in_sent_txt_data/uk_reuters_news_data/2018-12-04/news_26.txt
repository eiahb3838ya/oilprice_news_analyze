update 1-french power companies consider legal challenge to price freeze
france freezes power prices in response to protests state council would likely overrule tariff freeze adds detail analyst comment by benjamin mallet and geert de clercq paris dec reuters french independent power vendors association anode is considering making a legal challenge to a government freeze on edf s electricity prices it said on tuesday
the government on tuesday suspended increases to fuel taxes for at least six months in response to weeks of sometimes violent public protests and said it would keep gas and power prices unchanged this winter
anode president fabien chone said the proposed freeze on edf s regulated tariffs threatens the survival of some of its members
these operators all compete against edf which has an percent share of the retail power market
the government should lower power taxes or introduce support measures for anode s members it said
failing that we may have to initiate a legal challenge chone told reuters
anode includes direct energie engie italy s eni and dozens of smaller operators
government attempts to freeze power prices have been challenged systematically by anode in recent years and cancelled by the state council france s highest administrative court with consumers forced to pay fees retroactively
prime minister edouard philippe said that from to march the government would organise a nationwide debate on energy and that power and gas prices would not increase in the meantime
retail services specialist colombus consulting expects french power prices to rise by between percent and percent next year
even at percent it would be the highest increase in years
energy regulator cre has said it would make a proposal to the government in february with a view to introducing new tariffs in early
the government would then have three months to validate the cre proposal which means it could postpone a decision until after the may european parliament elections
many french governments have postponed tariff increases to protect consumers and their own approval ratings but legally the government has no authority to set prices
the tariffs freeze allows the government to buy time but they know they will be overruled and it will come back at them like a boomerang said colombus consulting s nicolas goldberg
unlike power prices which typically move once a year gas prices move every month
