tanzanian president john magufuli has asked his government to proceed with negotiations to set out the commercial and fiscal framework for the lng project equinor a majority energy company formerly known as statoil said
equinor will now proceed with our partner exxonmobil with negotiations for a host government agreement an equinor spokesman said in an email to reuters

we believe the government is best placed to lead the right way forward to deliver the project she added
shell declined to say whether it would join equinor and exxon mobil or would pursue separate talks with the government
