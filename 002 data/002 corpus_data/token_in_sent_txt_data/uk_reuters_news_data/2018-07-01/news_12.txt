update 5-saudi king said will boost oil output if needed - white house
reuters the leader of saudi arabia promised president donald trump that he can raise oil production if needed and the country has million barrels per day of spare capacity the white house said on saturday rowing back on an earlier trump tweet that appeared to suggest the saudis had agreed to boost output by that amount
trump told king salman bin abdulaziz al saud that the oil market could need more supply when the men spoke on friday the white house said
the saudi leader said he was ready to raise output if needed the white house said in a statement
king salman affirmed that the kingdom maintains a two million barrel per day spare capacity which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance read the statement
however a source familiar with saudi arabia s production plans told reuters earlier in the week of the kingdom s intention to increase output by bpd this month
saudi arabia along with other organization of petroleum exporting countries opec and nations including russia had agreed on june to boost production by a combined to million barrels a day so any million would be at least double market expectations
the white house statement undercut a tweet by trump earlier in the day when he wrote that saudi arabia had definitely agreed to produce more oil
just spoke to king salman of saudi arabia and explained to him that because of the turmoil disfunction in iran and venezuela i am asking that saudi arabia increase oil production maybe up to barrels to make up the difference prices to high
he has agreed trump tweeted
in the tweet trump said the extra saudi oil would help offset a decline in supply from iran after the united states pulled out of the iran nuclear deal in may and moved to reimpose oil sanctions
trump was not specific on whether the additional million barrels was a figure but worldwide daily demand is nearing million bpd
saudi state media reported that during the call the saudi king and trump emphasized the need to preserve oil market stability and efforts of countries to compensate for any potential shortage
the statement reported by saudi media did not mention any intention by saudi arabia to raise production by million bpd
saudi oil officials did not comment
the source familiar with the kingdom s plans told reuters last week that riyadh plans to boost output in july to million bpd the highest in its history up from mln in june
saudi arabia has a maximum sustainable capacity of million bpd but it has never tested that level of production
we will be in uncharted territory
while saudi arabia has the capacity in theory it takes time and money to bring these barrels online up to one year said amrita sen of consultancy energy aspects
benchmark brent crude was trading around a barrel on friday and a reuters poll showed prices look to remain strong for the rest of this year due to supply disruptions in countries including libya and venezuela and as the extra oil from opec fails to meet rising demand
saudi energy minister khalid met with secretary of state mike pompeo in washington on thursday to discuss energy security
the trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of iranian oil from november when the united states sanctions against tehran after trump withdrew from the nuclear deal agreed between iran and six major powers against the advice of allies in europe and elsewhere
officials are pressing allies in europe asia and the middle east to adhere to the sanctions once they are with the aim of pressuring iran into negotiating a new agreement
state department officials said this week the united states is prepared to work with countries on a basis to help them reduce imports of iranian oil and suggested some exemptions were possible
iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on saturday accused washington of trying to turn iranians against their government
they bring to bear economic pressure to separate the nation from the system but six presidents before him tried this and had to give up khamenei was quoted as saying on saturday by his website referring to trump
iran s rial currency has lost up to per cent of its value since last month when trump pulled out of the nuclear deal
iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili accused the united states and saudi arabia of trying to push up oil prices and said both countries are acting against the foundation of opec
if this happens it means trump is asking saudi arabia to walk away from opec he told reuters
the market will go up to i am sure as saudi arabia said they will plan an increase for july

this was managed between the two to rob the pocket of rest of the world he said
