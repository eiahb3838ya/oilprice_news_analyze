libya's noc warns of impact of oil port shutdown
tunis july reuters libya s national oil corporation noc said on sunday that a port blockade by eastern authorities could result in losses estimated at barrels per day bpd of crude oil and daily revenue of million
operations at the ports were blocked after the libyan national army lna announced last monday that it would no longer let the noc export from them
the standoff is part of a broader conflict in libya and has raised the prospect of a prolonged output drop from the opec member which had recently been pumping more than one million bpd
two terminals ras lanuf and es sider were shut by fighting involving the lna last month
the noc had said blockades would likely oblige it to declare force majeure at two other terminals hariga and zueitina on sunday but it has yet to do so
the lna also controls a fifth port at brega
however it warned in a statement that if force majeure was declared this would have significant short and long term consequences for noc affiliate companies the national economy and the libyan people
in addition to the crude oil losses the noc said output of natural gas used for local power supplies and oil and gas field operations would fall by million standard cubic feet per day and that more than bpd of condensate would be lost
the power generation at the zueitina and north benghazi power stations will be badly affected the noc said
the corporation is already facing a deficit in the fuel import budget and will not be able to compensate the lost gas due to the shutdown by importing more liquid fuel from to keep power plants operational the noc said it would have to burn valuable condensate resulting in significant negative environmental impact
displacing crude from the abu attifel to zueitina pipeline would require one million barrels of water and additional chemicals and waha oil company pipelines could be corroded by the stoppage the noc said
once stored crude was used refineries at brega sarir and tobruk would be forced to close the statement said
