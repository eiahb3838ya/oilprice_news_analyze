update 2-saudi economy starts to recover, set to accelerate as oil output rises
dubai reuters saudi arabia s economy began to recover in the first quarter of after shrinking for the first time in eight years during official data showed on sunday and the recovery looks set to accelerate in coming months with a rise in oil production
gross domestic product adjusted for inflation grew percent from a year earlier in the first three months of the government s statistics agency said
gdp had dropped from a year earlier in every quarter of as a global agreement among oil exporting countries caused saudi arabia to cut back its crude output
for the whole of gdp shrank percent
the impact of the oil deal faded at the start of after saudi arabia completed the required cuts
this allowed the oil sector which comprises over percent of the economy to grow percent from a year ago in the first quarter a big contrast to its percent decline in the last quarter of
in the next several months saudi oil production is set to expand
global producers agreed last month to boost output by a combined to million barrels per day and as the world s biggest crude exporter riyadh may account for the lion s share of the increase
president donald trump said in a tweet on saturday that saudi arabia s king salman had agreed to boost output by as much as million bpd to offset anticipated losses in production by iran which faces sanctions and venezuela
analysts think such a big jump is very unlikely
but monica malik chief economist at abu dhabi commercial bank said she was conservatively assuming a rise in average saudi output of bpd in the second half of which would be a increase of about percent
supply disruptions elsewhere in the world could cause riyadh to lift output even more malik added predicting overall saudi gdp growth of percent this year led by the oil sector
many businesses in saudi arabia are struggling under the weight of austerity steps designed to cut the government s big budget deficit
a percent tax was imposed at the start of and domestic fuel prices were increased
as a result malik predicted only modest gdp growth of percent this year up from percent in
to some degree we re likely to return to saudi arabia s old model of growth this year with rising oil exports feeding through into the rest of the economy she said
structural reforms to create other sources of growth may have an impact in coming years but don t look like they ll be in time to have an effect this the sector grew just percent from a year ago in the first quarter of only slightly faster than percent in the previous quarter
within that category the private sector which authorities hope will create new jobs to bring down an unemployment rate of nearly percent among saudi citizens inched up just percent faster than percent in last year s fourth quarter
the construction industry shrank percent from a year ago in the first quarter showing builders continued to struggle with state spending curbs and corporate caution that have reduced the number of big new projects in the past few years
the wholesale and retail sectors plus restaurants and hotels shrank percent suggesting saudi consumers curbed their spending because of the new tax
an exodus of hundreds of thousands of foreign workers from saudi arabia due to the weak economy is also hurting consumer demand
