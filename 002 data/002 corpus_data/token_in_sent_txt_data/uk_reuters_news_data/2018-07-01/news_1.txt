update 1-can saudi arabia pump much more oil?
london reuters the leader of saudi arabia has assured president donald trump that the kingdom can raise oil production if needed and the country has million barrels per day of spare capacity that could be deployed to help cool down oil prices to compensate for falling output in venezuela and iran
in a tweet on saturday trump said saudi arabia had agreed to increase output by up to this amount although a subsequent statement from the white house rowed back on this assertion
either way the kingdom opec s biggest member can barely raise output by million bpd to million bpd and even that would be difficult according to industry analysts who forecast a further oil price rally due to a lack of new supply
opec race to balance crude oil supply and demand below are comments from some leading opec analysts pierre andurand hedge fund manager i guess the saudis want to give the confidence to trump to go very hardcore on iran
exports to zero or an attack
it will be interesting to see what the saudis can really do and for how long
it seems that iranian regime change is priority number one for the amrita sen chief oil analyst at energy aspects we will be in unchartered territory
while saudi arabia has the capacity in theory it takes time and money to bring these barrels online possibly up to year
gary ross head of global oil analytics at s p global the saudis do not have million bpd of spare capacity as it would imply production of million bpd
they can likely produce a maximum of million and even that will be running their system at stress levels said ross
he added that with a potential output fall of up to million bpd in iran and further outages in venezuela and libya the world could be short of million bpd of oil output without an increase in saudi output by the end of the year
ole hansen head of commodities research at saxo bank we are seeing another strong signal from the two of the world s three largest producers to cap the price upside in oil
with russia agreeing to this we are seeing political interference in the setting of oil prices on the rise
saudi arabia agreeing to such a request basically raises the risk that opec has played out its role with saudi russia and the are now setting the i do not believe that saudi can increase production to million bpd but they can increase exports by digging into their it does however also increase middle east tensions and with iran controlling the strait of hormuz there is a risk that this could escalate to a point where million bpd would not be in the however a busy night on sunday can be expected with traders and funds getting caught on the long side
not least in wti where we saw a collapse in the gross short last week while the jumped by percent and the ratio hit a giovanni staunovo commodity analyst at ubs while president trump s tweet is very clear on how much oil he intends to see from saudi arabia the saudi press agency statement was more vague no volume increase the statement seems to suggest the kingdom stands ready but first wants to see larger disruptions a saudi production increase would move the kingdom s oil production into unchartered territory and would wipe out completely the kingdom s spare prices are likely to become more volatile over the coming months caught between two narratives oversupply concerns and dwindling spare market tightness reporting by amanda cooper rania el gamal ahmad ghaddar dmitry zhdannikov editing by louise heavens william maclean
