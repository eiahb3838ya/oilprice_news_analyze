update 4-u.s. charges, sanctions iranians for global cyber attacks on behalf of tehran
washington reuters the united states on friday charged and sanctioned nine iranians and an iranian company for attempting to hack into hundreds of universities worldwide dozens of firms and parts of the government including its main energy regulator on behalf of tehran s government
the cyber attacks beginning in at least pilfered more than terabytes of academic data and intellectual property from universities and universities in other countries the department of justice said describing the campaign as one of the largest hacks ever prosecuted
the treasury department said it was placing sanctions on the nine people and the mabna institute a company prosecutors characterized as designed to help iranian research organizations steal information
deputy attorney general rod rosenstein said the nine iranians were considered fugitives who may face extradition in more than countries if they travel outside iran
authorities will aggressively investigate and prosecute hostile actors who attempt to profit from america s ideas by infiltrating our computer systems and stealing intellectual property rosenstein told a news conference
the case will disrupt the defendants hacking operations and deter similar crimes he added
the hackers were not accused of being directly employed by iran s government
they were instead charged with criminal conduct waged primarily through the mabna institute on behalf of the islamic revolutionary guard corps the elite military force assigned to defend iran s shi ite theocracy from internal and external threats
in tehran iran s foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi denounced the move as provocative illegitimate and without any justifiable reason and another sign of the hostility of the ruling circles towards the iranian nation state news agency irna said
the targeting of the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc was a matter of special concern attorney geoffrey berman said because it oversees the interstate regulation of energy and holds details of some of the country s most sensitive hackers targeted email accounts of more than professors worldwide half in the united states and compromised about prosecutors said
hackers also targeted the labor department the united nations and the computer systems of the states hawaii and indiana prosecutors said
friday s actions are part of an effort by senior cyber security officials at the white house and across the government to blame foreign countries for malicious hacks
they were announced a day after president donald trump named john bolton a former ambassador to the united nations who is deeply sceptical of the international nuclear accord with iran as his new national security adviser
trump himself has repeatedly cast doubt on the nuclear deal in which the and other world powers eased sanctions in exchange for tehran putting limits on its nuclear programme
the department of justice on friday privately warned major internet infrastructure companies to expect attacks from iran an executive at one company who received the alert said
the officials said the most likely retaliation would be denial of service attacks on websites which are not destructive but disrupt commerce and communication
britain s national cyber security centre said on twitter the mabna institute was almost certainly responsible for cyber attacks targeting universities around the the sanctions and charges were the fourth time in the past few months the trump administration has blamed a foreign government for major cyber attacks a practice that was rare under the obama administration
last week the administration accused the russian government of cyber attacks stretching back at least two years that targeted the power grid
washington imposed new sanctions on russians and five groups including moscow s intelligence services for meddling in the election and other cyber attacks
friday s indictment in district court in new york said the iranian hackers did extensive background research of university professors before sending them spearphishing emails tailored to academic interests and scholarly publications
the emails purported to be from professors at another university and indicated the sender had read an article written by them prosecutors said
the emails would then direct recipients to click on links to related articles directing them to a malicious internet domain that appeared similar to the victims actual university portal where they would be prompted to enter their login credentials
once accounts were compromised the hackers would steal reams of academic data and intellectual property related to science and technology engineering social sciences and medicine the indictment said
stolen data was obtained to benefit iran s revolutionary guard and sold in iran through the websites megapaper and gigapaper to universities there prosecutors said
hackers targeted and compromised employee email accounts at companies and companies in countries including britain germany and italy prosecutors said
victim companies in the united states included two media and entertainment companies one law firm technology firms and two bank and investment firms among others
unlike the precise targeting of academics companies were subjected to a broad technique known as password spraying that uncovers lists of company email accounts online and then tries to hack into them with common default passwords
once inside the hackers would steal entire email mailboxes
the treasury department also put sanctions on another iranian behzad mesri
sometimes known as skote vahshat mesri was charged in with hacking cable tv network hbo to leak unaired episodes of the fantasy drama game of thrones
mesri is still at large officials said
the obama administration in indicted seven iranians for attacks on dozens of banks and for trying to shut down a new york dam
those hackers were also accused of working on behalf of iran s government
none of the iranians indicted in have been arrested or extradited a justice department spokesman said
