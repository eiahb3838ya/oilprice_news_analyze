the new reports come as the white house seeks to shake off persistent criticism by lawmakers of ethical lapses and wasteful spending by trump s senior officials something that has helped fuel a high rate of turnover
health secretary tom price was forced out and replaced last year after reports emerged of lavish spending on flights
pruitt and zinke are viewed as among trump s most productive cabinet officials and key to the president s policy of expanding energy production and exports by slashing environmental regulations and opening federal lands to drilling and mining
trump has rebuffed recent calls by both democratic and republican lawmakers to fire pruitt saying he is doing a fantastic job and is in coal and energy the government accountability office said the epa violated the financial services and general government appropriations act with pruitt s privacy booth
the law prohibits an agency from obligating more than in federal funds to furnish redecorate or make improvements in the office of a presidential appointee without first notifying appropriations committees in the senate and house of representatives
liz bowman an epa spokeswoman said the agency was addressing gao s concern with regard to congressional notification about this expense and will be sending congress the necessary information this the booth which pruitt had told lawmakers in a hearing was needed to conduct agency business was built in a former storage closet in the administrator s office
the gao had been asked to investigate the matter by democratic lawmakers

the interior department s watchdog said in its report monday that secretary zinke chartered a plane for from las vegas to kalispell montana in june that could have been the flight was linked to a controversial visit zinke made to a national hockey league team owned by a campaign donor
we determined that zinke s use of chartered flights in fiscal year fy generally followed relevant law policy rules and regulations the report said
we found however that a chartered flight he took in june after speaking at the developmental camp for the golden knights a professional hockey team based in las vegas nevada could have been avoided it added
the report said the visit appeared unrelated to zinke s work as interior chief pointing out that a video recording of the speech showed he never mentioned his role at the department and focused mainly on his experience as a navy seal
the hockey team is owned by bill foley a donor to zinke s past congressional campaigns
heather swift an interior department spokeswoman said the report said exactly what was known all along that the chartered aircraft followed relevant law and regulations
she did not comment on the watchdog s finding that the las vegas flight could have been avoided
zinke has also defended his use of noncommercial aircraft as necessary for reaching the remote parts of the country that his department oversees and said past interior secretaries have also relied on them
zinke has also taken heat for other types of spending including the repair of doors in his office that cost thousands of dollars
