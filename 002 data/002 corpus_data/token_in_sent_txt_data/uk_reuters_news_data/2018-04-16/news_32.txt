explainer-why the monsoon is so crucial for india, prime minister modi
mumbai april reuters india s monsoon rains are likely to be percent of their average in its meteorological department said on monday reassuring farmers ahead of summer planting in a country where only half of the farmland is irrigated
what are the categories of monsoon
a normal or average monsoon means rainfall between percent and percent of a average of cm inches in total during the monsoon season from june according to the india meteorological department s imd classification
rainfall below percent of the average would be classified as a drought
during prime minister narendra modi first two years in office in and there were consecutive droughts that led to some criticism here due to the government handling of the issue
rainfall above percent of the average would mean an excessive monsoon which would not be as damaging as a drought but could be potentially harmful for the yields of certain crops
the monsoon season starts with rains on the southern kerala coast around june covering the whole country by the middle of july
why is the monsoon important
the monsoon delivers about percent of india s annual rainfall and determines the yield of key crops such as rice wheat sugarcane and oilseeds such as soybeans
the farm sector accounts for about percent of india s trillion economy but employs more than half of the country s billion people
if monsoon rains lift farm output it can boost demand for consumer goods as it raises incomes of rural people
a stronger economic outlook would lift equities mainly for companies selling products in rural areas including consumer goods automobiles fertilisers and pesticides
india is in crops such as rice and wheat but a drought would require the country to import foodstuffs
in india imported sugar after poor rains sending global prices to record highs and pushing up local inflation
monsoon rains replenish reservoirs and groundwater allowing better irrigation and more hydropower output
higher rainfall can trim demand for subsidised diesel which is used to pump water from wells for irrigation
how does the monsoon affect inflation and central bank policy
food accounts for percent of india s consumer price index which the central bank closely monitors while deciding on monetary policy
a bumper farm output would keep food prices under control
during past droughts the government supported farmers by giving out incentives straining the fiscal deficit
a good monsoon will limit government spending on such measures
how reliable is the monsoon forecast
the imd issues its first forecast typically more than a month ahead of the monsoon s onset
on average its forecast has been accurate only once every five years over the past two decades even after taking into account an error band of plus or minus percentage points
the imd s forecast for the monsoon was its most accurate since
last year there was a difference of only percentage point between the forecast and the actual rainfall
even during normal monsoon years some parts of india face drought while some others suffer from floods
the imd will come out with a second forecast for the monsoon rains in june
why is the monsoon important for prime minister modi ahead of the elections
modi who has promised to double farmers income over five years remains popular nearly four years into his term
farmer unrest however has flared in some states ruled by his party catching regional leaders
a normal monsoon could lead to higher output of crops helping state leaders placate farmers
