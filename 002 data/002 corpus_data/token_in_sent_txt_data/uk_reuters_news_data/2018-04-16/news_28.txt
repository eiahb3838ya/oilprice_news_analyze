column-hedge funds build record bullish position in brent: kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london april reuters hedge funds are holding a bullish position in crude oil and refined fuels but the buying seems to have run out of momentum and is increasingly concentrated only in brent
hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by million barrels in the week to april
the net long position has increased by million barrels over the last four weeks to billion barrels
net length across the petroleum complex is only million below the record of billion set on
but the increasing bullishness is becoming more selective and is almost entirely concentrated in brent according to an analysis of position records published by regulators and exchanges
portfolio managers increased their net long position in brent by million barrels in the week to april and have raised net length by a total of million barrels since
by contrast the net long position in wti was cut by million barrels last week and is down by million barrels since
net positions in gasoline heating oil and european gasoil were cut or essentially unchanged in the most recent week
the result is an increasing divergence between brent and wti and to a lesser extent between brent and refined fuels
portfolio managers now hold a record net long position of million barrels in brent up from million on
hedge fund long positions outnumber shorts in brent by more than up from a ratio of back in january
there are plenty of reasons to be bullish about crude prices including strong growth in oil consumption continued output restrictions by opec disruption in venezuela and the threat of new sanctions on iran
opec members have indicated they want to see a further rise in oil prices to stimulate more upstream investment and may be targeting prices as high as per barrel up from just over currently
the latest position data refers to positions at the end of trading on april before the united states and its allies launched air strikes on syria in the early hours of april
rising political and military tensions across the middle east including in syria and yemen have created a speculative bid for oil prices
nonetheless hedge fund positioning in brent has become exceptionally stretched and is a significant source of downside risk if and when fund managers try to realise some of their profits
