update 2-merkel's tougher russia stance meets resistance in germany
berlin reuters germany s europe minister called on monday for a new policy of easing tensions with russia adding to a chorus of voices pressing chancellor angela merkel to moderate her hardened stance towards the kremlin
the conservative chancellor swung behind britain after the poison attack on a former russian double agent in england last month expelling four diplomats despite uneasiness among a political class that is wary of confrontation with germany s giant eastern neighbour
europe minister michael roth a member of the social democrat party spd said that while the european union needed a united front on russia sanctions should aim to bring moscow to the negotiating table
reflexes are just as dangerous as naively remaining silent over the policies of the current russian leadership he wrote in die welt newspaper
many western countries are pushing for a more assertive stance against moscow over president vladimir putin s backing for syrian president bashar accused of using chemical weapons in the country s civil war
merkel s tone has hardened over the four years since russia s annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula which led to western nations imposing the sanctions on moscow
but with extensive business and energy links to russia germany has been traditionally cautious in its relations with moscow a view reflected on monday by a close merkel ally
annegret secretary general of merkel s christian democrats cdu said she backed actively using the channels of communication that we have with russia adding that s certainly an area where the chancellor can play a decisive tipped as a possible successor to merkel said a debate was underway among the conservatives about whether sanctions made sense although she added that unjust acts committed by russia needed to be penalised
the german committee on eastern european economic relations a business lobby group expressed concern about a new wave of sanctions
these could hit european companies that had supported significant transactions on behalf of blacklisted russian individuals it said adding that the german government and brussels needed to protect eu firms from sanctions
roth whose party is junior partner in merkel s coalition echoed comments from president steinmeier a fellow social democrat that too much is at stake for germany to cast russia as an enemy
opinion in the coalition is not necessarily divided along party lines
foreign minister heiko maas also a social democrat has appeared to shift away from a conciliatory approach to moscow while alexander dobrindt a lawmaker for merkel s bavarian sister party has questioned the effectiveness of the sanctions against russia
the sequence of interventions by roth and steinmeier from the spd and dobrindt and former defence minister zu guttenberg on the right highlight how merkel s diminished authority in her fourth and likely final term in office is limiting her room for manoeuvre
guttenberg himself once tipped as a potential merkel successor before his fall from grace in an academic plagiarism scandal criticised the government for its policy towards intervention in syria in the face of a cynical russia
we make it easy for ourselves letting the others do the dirty work he said of merkel s decision not to participate in missile strikes launched by the united states britain and france on syria last week after its suspected use of chemical weapons
it is good that somebody still acts when someone kills children innocent people he told bild newspaper
