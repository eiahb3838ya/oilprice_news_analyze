shell defends climate strategy in clash with investors
london reuters royal dutch shell defended its ambition to cut carbon emissions on monday urging investors to oppose a shareholder resolution arguing that the oil and gas giant is not doing enough to meet international targets to tackle climate change
the company like many of its peers has faced growing investor pressure to address the need to reduce fossil fuel burning forcing it to seek a delicate balance with a need to secure growing returns from its traditional business
last november shell outlined plans to halve carbon emissions from its operations and sales of its fuels by responding to investor pressure with what is seen as one of the most ambitious goals in the sector
for a graphic on carbon reduction goals click but follow this a climate activist shareholder group put forward a resolution that will be voted on at shell s annual general meeting next month urging it to set more aggressive targets aligned with the paris climate agreement goal of limiting global warming to well below degrees celsius
i don t think a percent reduction of emissions footprint in meets the paris climate agreement mark van baal founder of follow this told reuters
shell uses these ambitions to do business as usual in the next the company should stop exploring for new oil and gas resources and shift to renewable energy van baal said
last year s resolution by follow this on the topic won the support of percent of shareholders but the debate around shell s climate strategy has become central in recent years
shell s management urged shareholders to vote against the resolution at the agm which will be held in the hague on may
we share the objective of follow this for shell to show leadership in the energy transition but at the same time we consider the resolution unnecessary given that we have already outlined an approach that is much and much more progressive shell chief executive officer ben van beurden told reporters in a phone briefing
shell will have to initially catch up with society s carbon reduction goals because shell s current emissions are higher than other businesses but by it plans to be in line with the global targets
we ll be aligned with society s progress but we will not be tied to an approach that potentially moves too quickly or too slowly to this transition van beurden said
van beurden admitted that the transition could have a very significant impact on shell s business in the long run
shell plans to reduce its emissions by increasing the share of gas and biofuels production investing in renewable energy such as solar and offshore wind as well as in technologies to capture carbon and van beurden said
shell plans to invest between billion per year on its energy business by the end of the decade less than a tenth of its planned annual spending but significantly higher than its rivals
