update 1-russia, brazil woes could lead to aluminium supply shortage - hydro ceo
oslo reuters the global aluminium market could face supply shortages because of sanctions on russia and norsk hydro s production cuts in brazil hydro s chief executive told reuters on monday
industries ranging from automakers to producers are worrying over deliveries and sharp price hikes svein richard brandtzaeg said in an interview
over the weekend hydro cut output from the albras aluminium plant in brazil by half as it had previously warned in response to an unresolved dispute at its nearby alunorte alumina refinery which supplies the key raw material
if this lasts long it s possible it will also lead to production cuts at our norwegian smelters which also receive alumina from alunorte brandtzaeg said
this is not positive for the aluminium industry
we ve got customers seeking stable relations and our customers are particularly worried in this situation both by the prices but also by the cost of delivery premiums he added
aluminium prices hit highs on the london metal exchange on monday continuing a spike that began when the united states imposed sanctions on uc rusal the world s producer as well as hydro s own cuts
there is a shortage of alumina and there will also be a shortage of aluminium unless rusal can find new markets quite quickly brandtzaeg said at hydro s headquarters in oslo
rusal could potentially maintain its production by exporting more to asian countries although this could in turn disrupt the regional market balance he added
the metal would remain part of the global balance and we d have to expect more exports from asia into our european markets particularly since china faces restrictions on exports to the brandtzaeg said
president donald trump last month imposed import tariffs of percent on aluminium and percent on steel to protect metal producers from cheap imports
rio tinto s declaration of force majeure on certain customer contracts as a result of the sanctions on rusal also boosted aluminium prices on monday
hydro s cutbacks at albras south america s largest aluminium plant with an annual capacity of tonnes amount to an equivalent of tonnes per year and will last until alunorte is back to full capacity
following heavy rains in february hydro admitted there had been unregulated emissions of water into a river at the alunorte plant but denied it had contaminated the environment
