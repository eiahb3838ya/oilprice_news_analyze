experts fail to find origin of nuclear pollution cloud over europe
oslo reuters international experts have not been able to find what caused a cloud of radioactive pollution that spread over europe last year and prompted fears of a nuclear leak swedish authorities said on monday
monitoring stations recorded high levels of a radioactive isotope in the air over most european cities at the beginning of october
scientists from france said soon afterwards they thought the source was an accident at a nuclear facility in russia or kazakhstan a suggestion dismissed by both countries
a group of experts formed to investigate the incident had now decided there was not enough information to pinpoint the origin sweden s radiation safety authority one of the group s members said on monday
available data does not provide sufficient information to verify that the emissions originate from any of the activities that have been assumed to cause the event the swedish authority said
the authority was referring to ruthenium the radioactive isotope identified by the monitoring stations that does not occur naturally and is the product of splitting atoms in a nuclear reaction
the commission of experts met last week and decided that its member groups from russia sweden france germany britain finland and norway could return to their countries and carry on their research independently said sweden
france s nuclear safety institute irsn said in november that the likely source was an accident at a nuclear fuel treatment site or centre for radioactive medicine
it said its findings ruled out a nuclear reactor
it added there had been no impact on human health or the environment in europe
