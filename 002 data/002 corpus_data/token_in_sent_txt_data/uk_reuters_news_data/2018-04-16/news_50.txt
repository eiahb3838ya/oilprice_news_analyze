tokyo fears trump could link security with trade at summit with abe
tokyo reuters japanese prime minister shinzo abe could find his close ties with donald trump sorely tested at a summit this week in which tokyo fears the leader will to try to link vital security matters with touchy trade topics
it is a fraught time for both sides and comes as trump prepares to meet with north korean leader kim jong un whose government has been openly antagonistic toward japan
abe is struggling with declining popularity because of suspected cronyism scandals
trump whose white house is grappling with scandals and investigations of its own may be hunting for a political win ahead of november midterm congressional elections
japan wants trump to avoid a deal in which pyongyang gives up ballistic missiles that can hit the mainland but keeps missiles that threaten japan
abe also wants trump to bring up japanese citizens kidnapped by pyongyang long ago
at the summit with trump on tuesday and wednesday tokyo is equally eager to avoid being pushed into talks on a free trade agreement aimed not only at market access but at monetary and currency policies
if abe brings up abductions and short and missiles it s obvious that trump will say ok do something on the economic side said a japanese ruling party lawmaker in ties who declined to be identified because the topic and timing are sensitive
trump s ability to give allies policy whiplash was on display last week when he said he d asked aides to talks on the multinational trans pacific partnership tpp that he abandoned last year
afterward he tweeted that the united states would only rejoin if offered substantially better terms and urged a bilateral deal with japan which has hit us hard on trade for years eleven remaining members led by japan signed a agreement in march
tokyo has long hoped washington would return to tpp but is opposed to any major makeover of the pact to help that happen
what trump wants most is a success story and that means bringing japan into bilateral economic talks the lawmaker said
trump s decision to include japan as a target for tariffs on its steel exports while exempting several other countries was widely seen as pressure on japan to agree to a deal
japan will propose a new framework to discuss trade issues with washington as a way to coax it back to tpp the nikkei business daily said on saturday
ongoing talks led by vice president mike pence and japanese deputy prime minister taro aso have produced few results
but such a proposal would face headwinds if trump insists on renegotiating the tpp or tries to push tokyo into a pact
tpp achieved the impossible if they want to rebalance or change it is very delicate and i don t see a realistic possibility of going further in any way said a japanese government source who also declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic
abe who was the first foreign leader to meet trump after his election and has since held two summits both of which included chummy rounds of golf sought this week s meeting after trump stunned tokyo with his willingness meet kim jong un
a senior administration official told reporters in washington that the two countries were cooperating from the top down
we manage frictions as they come
and i think overall the relationship has never been better the official said
japanese officials fear the midterm elections this year and other domestic headaches are making trump especially keen for success both in talks with north korea and on the economic front where he has threatened a trade war with china and pressed south korea into revising a bilateral deal
the midterm elections are foremost in trump s mind katsuyuki kawai a special ruling liberal democratic party ldp adviser for foreign affairs to abe told reuters
this is precisely the time when allies must join together on security matters to face north korea kawai added
abe may find the talks complicated by his efforts to improve ties with russia and china while being likely to join trump in criticising some of beijing s trade practices
abe is expected to meet russian president vladimir putin in may to seek progress in a territorial dispute
on saturday abe expressed support for the resolve of the united states britain and france to halt chemical weapons use but only understanding for their attacks on syria which putin has denounced
given trump s propensity for diplomatic experts advised abe to steer clear of details at the summit
we don t want to turn the whole thing into bargaining between the united states and japan said narushige michishita a former defence official and now a professor at the national graduate institute for policy studies
