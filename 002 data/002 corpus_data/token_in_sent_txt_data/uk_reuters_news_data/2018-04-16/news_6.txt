alberta seeks to cut oil to british columbia in canada pipeline row
vancouver april reuters alberta officials will introduce legislation on monday expected to give the provincial government power to cut oil shipments to neighboring british columbia in an escalation of a row over the stalled expansion of a kinder morgan canada pipeline which the pacific province opposes
the trans mountain expansion issue has pitted ottawa against british columbia
it could turn into a constitutional crisis derail prime minister justin trudeau s energy strategy and dent business confidence
alberta s legislation slated for monday afternoon could make gasoline more expensive in british columbia and comes a day after an emergency summit to unlock the stalemate failed
on sunday trudeau pledged financial aid to the c billion billion project reiterating ottawa has jurisdiction over it and it will be built
but shortly after the summit ended
premier john horgan tweeted i will continue to fight to defend
jobs our economy and environment now and for future horgan campaigned on a pledge to block the expansion which would nearly triple capacity on the existing pipeline from alberta to s coast
trudeau said his government would draft legislation which is unlikely to come for several weeks to reaffirm federal jurisdiction over the issue
the legislation and financial aid have the same aim of making sure that one that this pipeline will be built and two that all of the investors involved know that we take this seriously and they can be confident it will go through said a source close to the government
kinder morgan canada s shares rose in early trading and then dipped to c on the toronto stock exchange down canadian cents
the energy sector as a whole was also slightly down as oil prices slipped
kinder morgan pipeline protesters who have been arrested for civil contempt at the company s burnaby mountain facilities were due to appear in court on monday
more than people including federal green party leader elizabeth may have been arrested since for violating a civil injunction obtained by kinder morgan
we continue to regard the calculus as fraught and believe the failure to resolve legal challenges make the actual construction of the trans mountain expansion difficult even with federal government intervention credit suisse analysts said in a research note on monday
oil producers and the alberta government are desperate for the pipeline to go ahead as rising production has outstripped existing pipeline capacity leading to a widening of the normal differential between western canadian oil prices and the benchmark
