rpt-italy's eni defies sceptics, may up stake in nuclear fusion project
repeats from friday no changes to text by giancarlo navach milan april reuters italian energy group eni is considering stepping up its investment in nuclear fusion potentially doubling down on a technology considered so uncertain that eni remains the only global oil company prepared to place a bet on it
eni and bigger rivals such as shell and bp have been looking at moving into renewable energy as climate change the falling cost of solar and wind power and a shift to electric vehicles raise doubts over demand for oil
eni last month committed million euros million to one of several projects aiming to produce energy by fusing atoms at temperatures as hot as the sun a process seen by doubters as still closer to science fiction than commercial reality
after the move eni s head of development operations and technology roberto casula said it might raise its investment in commonwealth fusion system a firm created by the massachusetts institute of technology mit which is developing the project
after the transition to renewable energy the real breakthrough technologically is nuclear fusion casula said adding the process involved recreating the physics of the sun producing heat but no emissions and very limited nuclear waste
casula estimates it will cost billion to develop a fusion reactor by and says commonwealth fusion system is looking to raise more funds and to draw up an overall investment agreement with a range of financiers
casula and mit declined to give the size of eni s current stake and the eni executive could not say at this stage how much it would be ready to invest
he said eni had signed a deal giving it the right to use the project s intellectual property
the eventual stake we ll have in the company will be decided when there is an overall investment agreement depending also on how much they will raise casula said
the mit project is vying with research teams in france china and britain to develop a reactor that can generate more energy than the enormous amount that fusion consumes and can also safely contain a mass of gases or plasma
italy also recently entered the race though eni is sticking with mit saying the boston project is unique in its aim to produce electricity while others have scientific objectives
all projects are based on a system known as tokamak which uses superconducting magnets to hold the plasma at temperatures of up to million degrees suspending it inside a vacuum chamber without it touching the chamber s walls
to make electricity heat produced by the fusion of hydrogen isotopes is used to spin steam turbines in the conventional way
the iter project is the largest endeavour with a budget of around billion euros
a collaboration between europe the united states china india japan russia and south korea it is more than halfway towards the first test of its plasma by and first fusion by
unlike the mit project the international thermonuclear experimental reactor iter team does not plan to generate electricity saying this will be further in the future and is being supported by governments rather than the private sector
based on our experience with the iter project we feel the mit timeline to a power plant in years is very ambitious if not overly ambitious iter chief scientist tim luce said
but if they succeed we will celebrate their iter director bernard bigot said nuclear fusion research and development were being driven mainly by governments likening it to the early days of space technology and suggesting the time had yet to arrive when private investors would take the lead
in fusion research we are only about in the before anybody got to the moon bigot said
mit and eni are more optimistic
the team which has built a experimental tokamak reactor plans to develop a system of superconducting magnets within three years and build a fusion reactor within eight before finally within years completing a power plant generating electricity
our goal is to do things even faster than that because it is a unique opportunity right now and with climate change we should be aggressive and ambitious said bob mumgaard chief executive of mit project company commonwealth fusion system
he said the mit and iter projects differed mainly in their magnet technologies and that mit s system enabled it to contain plasma in a smaller chamber
in fusion devices the magnetic field is very important and this will allow us to build a device which is one sixtieth the volume of iter mumgaard said adding that mit s reactor would be the size of a basketball court
though research into nuclear fusion dates to the some scientists doubt the technology can become a commercial energy source within mit s timeframe
the ability to make these components work in the desired way in the presence of such intense fields of irradiation is a very big challenge said matteo passoni a nuclear engineer and expert on plasma physics at milan s polytechnic university
for eni though its investment in fusion represents a modest bet on a potentially big discovery a familiar equation to its upstream division when it explores for oil and gas
arriving within years at a commercial reactor is exactly the timeframe we use in upstream casula said
