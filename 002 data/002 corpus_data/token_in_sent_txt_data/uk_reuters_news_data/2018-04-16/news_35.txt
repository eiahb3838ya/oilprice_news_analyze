rpt-canada's trudeau faces election risk after firm's pipeline surprise
repeats april story with no changes to text by david ljunggren ottawa april reuters canada s government got just hours notice that it would be thrust into a political and economic crisis by an ultimatum from a pipeline operator government sources said leaving prime minister justin trudeau scrambling for options in a dispute that could damage his chances
the kinder morgan canada pipeline issue has pitted ottawa against the pacific province of british columbia and could turn into a constitutional crisis derail trudeau s energy strategy and dent business confidence
trudeau broke off a foreign trip to hold an emergency meeting on sunday with the premiers of two provinces locked in a standoff over the pipeline after the company set a may deadline to resolve the impasse or it would walk away
federal officials had been talking to the company since february when british columbia s coalition which includes the green party made clear it would delay the planned expansion of the trans mountain pipeline from alberta s oil sands to the coast
but the government had no idea that kinder morgan canada was about to drop a bombshell
kinder morgan s announcement on sunday was unexpected said a senior government official who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation
we had hours the move by kinder morgan canada which was spun off by its parent last year puts pressure on trudeau to solve the problem without alienating voters in british columbia or presiding over an investment failure ahead of elections
a second federal government source said the prime minister and senior cabinet members had worked behind the scenes for weeks pressing british columbia to change its position
if we re talking of things going awry british columbia knew this was federal jurisdiction said the source
the operator wants to almost triple the capacity of the existing pipeline
ottawa which approved the project in insists it has jurisdiction
british columbia s government elected in disagrees citing the risk of a spill
i do believe we have a mandate to defend the coast provincial premier john horgan told reporters on friday
trudeau won power in partly thanks to extra seats his liberals won in british columbia as well as increased support from environmentalists
cracking down too hard would cost him support in both camps leaving him with a weak minority government in the october elections
tensions over the pipeline meant liberals in british columbia were already nervous about softening support before kinder morgan canada s ultimatum said a liberal party official
the liberals also have to pick up seats in the province of quebec which has a strong green tradition
it wouldn t really take a lot to tip the government into minority territory said pollster nik nanos of nanos research
if you re looking at hard political calculus the prime minister realistically has to tilt in favor of the environment because if he doesn t that will kill him in during sunday s meeting trudeau will lay out the various financial regulatory and legal options said the second government source
it s not a matter of getting angry or being mean or nice about it he will lay out the facts said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity
the federal and alberta governments both say they could take a stake in the pipeline to keep the project alive with alberta s premier saying her province could even buy it outright
kinder morgan canada has said it was open to discussions but did not elaborate
the first government source there was a huge gray zone of possible government help citing the past bailout of the auto industry in federal loan guarantees for a project and ottawa s investment in an offshore energy project
bank deputy chairman frank mckenna a member of alberta s pipeline advisory taskforce said he raised the issue with trudeau in a recent call and that ottawa has to provide deal certainty a backstop
that could be something in the nature of an indemnity agreement or a guarantee against potential losses that would come from political instability and not based on normal construction risk said mckenna a former premier of new brunswick
td bank is kinder morgan canada s biggest lender
at the end of the day this pipeline can t be allowed to fail it would be a huge blow to the leadership of the country and to the image of the with additional reporting by matt scuffham in toronto julie gordon in vancouver
