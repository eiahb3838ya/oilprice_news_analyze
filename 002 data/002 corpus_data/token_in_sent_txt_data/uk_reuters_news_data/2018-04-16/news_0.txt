update 1-alberta readies to cut b.c. fuel shipments in canada pipeline row
recasts adds legislation detail comments from politicians and first nation elder by julie gordon and nicole mordant vancouver april reuters canada s alberta province on monday edged closer to cutting off fuel shipments to neighboring british columbia in an escalation of a row over the stalled c billion billion expansion of the kinder morgan canada trans mountain pipeline
the project has pitted ottawa and alberta against british columbia
and could turn into a constitutional crisis derail prime minister justin trudeau s energy strategy and dent business confidence
kinder morgan said earlier this month it was halting most work on the trans mountain expansion project which was approved by canada in but has been beset by legal tussles
the expansion of the pipeline which extends from alberta to the
coast is desperately needed by alberta which wants to export more of the crude it produces
but it is vehemently opposed by which has pledged new environmental rules and a legal challenge putting construction at risk
seeking to put pressure on its neighbor alberta introduced legislation on monday that gives it the power to control what products flow through export pipelines allowing it to prioritize more valuable crude oil shipments over refined fuels like gasoline
that could hurt which uses alberta s refined fuel
trans mountain is the only pipeline in north america that carries both crude and refined fuel products
we did not start this fight but let there be no doubt we will do whatever it takes to build this pipeline alberta premier rachel notley told reporters

environment minister george heyman said in response that his government was prepared to defend british columbians interests with every legal means on sunday trudeau pledged financial aid and said his government would draft legislation to reaffirm federal jurisdiction over the issue
those measures have the aim of making sure that one that this pipeline will be built and two that all of the investors involved know that we take this seriously and they can be confident it will go through said a source close to the government on monday
kinder morgan canada s shares closed up canadian cents at c on the toronto stock exchange
under the new legislation alberta can ask companies exporting energy products to seek a license allowing the government to impose restrictions on transport by pipeline rail and truck
the province will only enforce the new rules if deemed necessary and any move may be tied to the outcome of a planned may decision by kinder morgan on whether construction will go ahead notley said
aboriginal and municipal leaders held a news conference in the
port city of vancouver to reiterate their opposition to the project which they say poses a grave environmental risk
they can call in the canadian army ok i ll stand in front said amy george a first nation elder
i m going to stand up for my grandchildren for my waters for my land and for my canadian dollars additional reporting by andrea hopkins in ottawa editing by david gregorio and rosalba
