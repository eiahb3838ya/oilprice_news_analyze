both neighbouring south american countries said the saturday incident had occurred within their territorial waters
a border dispute has heated up in recent years as irving exxon has discovered more than billion barrels of oil and gas off guyana s shores
guyana foreign affairs minister carl greenidge said he could not for the moment say whether the two ships owned by norway s petroleum and hired by exxon would resume their seismic survey or if they would return to the area where the incident occurred citing the ongoing talks with exxon
when asked if guyanese authorities would provide the vessels with protection if they continue exploration he said guyana is committed to resolving territorial disputes by peaceful we will therefore first try to explore and exhaust diplomatic channels greenidge said in an emailed response to questions from reuters
guyana is a small state of less than a million persons compared with venezuela s population of earlier on monday exxon declined to say when the survey would restart referring questions to pgs
bard stenberg a pgs senior vice president declined to comment on any resumption of the work or if the company has sought to have guyana provide protection for its vessels

a couple hours later we learnt that the venezuelan navy had withdrawn from the area he added
critics of venezuela s socialist president nicolas maduro say he has rekindled tensions with its eastern neighbour over the essequibo region a sparsely populated area making up of guyana s territory that is also claimed by venezuela to distract from a severe economic crisis in the nation
venezuela is home to the world s largest crude reserves but production is hovering near its lowest levels in years due to underinvestment hyperinflation and mismanagement under military control of the company

venezuela freed the vessel a week later
