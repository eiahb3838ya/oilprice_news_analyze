update 3-iranian president presents budget, says u.s. sanctions to hit growth
dubai reuters iran s president hassan rouhani on tuesday presented a billion state budget with increased spending on lower income groups saying sanctions would affect people s lives and economic growth but not bring the government to its knees
president donald trump pulled the united states out of a multilateral nuclear deal with iran in may and reimposed sanctions on it including on its vital oil industry
america s goal is to bring iran s islamic system to its knees and it will fail in this but sanctions will no doubt affect people s lives and the country s development and economic growth rouhani told parliament in a speech carried live on state television
he gave the value of the nominally balanced draft budget excluding the spending of state enterprises at about trillion rials for the next iranian year which starts on march
that figure is up from about trillion rials he had proposed for this year but the new budget is effectively worth about half of this year s because of the weakening of iran s currency
under the unofficial exchange rate used on the free market the budget is worth about billion
rouhani said state employees and pensioners would get a percent pay rise next year and the budget included billion at a subsidized rate less than half of the market to provide cheap basic goods such as food and medicine up from billion in this year s budget
officials have said the budget is designed to provide for the basic needs of groups including state employees and pensioners and to support production and employment
it also seeks to relaunch thousands of stalled state projects with the help of private investors
the draft budget has to be passed by parliament and approved by a clerical body that vets legislation before it becomes law
rouhani called for trimming the state sector and curbing the government s dependence on oil income which is forecast at trillion rials in the proposed budget
officials have said the budget calculations were based on a forecast crude price of per barrel and exports of to million barrels per day down from a peak of almost million bpd in
if the private sector was active in the country and if the budget did not rely heavily on oil the impact of sanctions would have been much less rouhani said
a separate draft budget for state companies institutions and banks allocates them a total of billion
rouhani s speech was interrupted by parliament members who iranian news agencies said were mostly from the southwestern khuzestan province and were protesting over shortages of drinking water in their region
