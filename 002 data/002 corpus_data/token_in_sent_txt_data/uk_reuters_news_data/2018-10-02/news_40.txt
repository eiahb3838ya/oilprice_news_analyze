rpt-bill allowing u.s. to sue opec drawing renewed interest
repeats story with no changes to headline or text by stephanie kelly and rania el gamal new oct reuters with oil prices hitting fresh highs proposals to allow the united states to sue opec nations are getting a fresh look in congress though they were once considered a longshot to becoming law
a senate subcommittee on wednesday will hear testimony on the no oil producing and exporting cartels act or nopec which would revoke the sovereign immunity that has long shielded opec members from legal action
the bill would change antitrust law to allow opec producers to be sued for collusion it would make it illegal to restrain oil or gas production or set those prices removing sovereign immunity that courts have ruled exists under current law
past leaders have opposed the nopec bill but the possibility of its success may have increased due to president donald trump s frequent criticism of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and as some predict that brent crude the international benchmark could reach a barrel before long
opec is a pet peeve for him said joe mcmonigle senior energy policy analyst at hedgeye potomac research
everybody thinks he could easily support saudi arabia is lobbying the government to prevent the bill s passage sources familiar with the matter said
business groups and oil companies also oppose the bill citing the possibility of retaliation from other countries
opec controls output from member nations by setting production targets
prices are up percent following the cartel s decision to cut output at the end of hitting a barrel on monday and lawmakers have trained their ire on the group saying it is again harming consumers and represents interference in free markets
wednesday s hearing before the senate subcommittee on antitrust competition policy and consumer rights could give insight into the executive branch s stance mcmonigle said
one of the witnesses will be makan delrahim assistant attorney general for the justice department s antitrust division who has written in support of such legislation
a version of nopec passed both houses of congress in but was shelved after president george bush said he would veto the legislation
chances of passage this year are slim as the house of representatives is scheduled to be in session only days the rest of this year leaving little time for anything but legislation like keeping the government funded
saudi arabia the world s top oil exporter is worried that nopec could turn into another justice against sponsors of terrorism act jasta law which allows victims of the attacks in the united states to sue riyadh the sources said
the jasta law is seen as key to why saudi aramco was hesitant in publicly listing its shares on markets in an ipo that has since been shelved
with close to trillion in investments in the united states riyadh has a lot to lose if nopec becomes law
saudi energy minister khalid raised concerns about it with officials including energy secretary rick perry during private meetings in recent months two sources told reuters on condition of anonymity
earlier this year the chamber of commerce and american petroleum institute told congress they opposed the bill saying surging energy output had mitigated opec s influence
since the renewed sanctions on iran this may other nations including saudi arabia have agreed to increase production
however that has not yet stopped oil s upward climb
