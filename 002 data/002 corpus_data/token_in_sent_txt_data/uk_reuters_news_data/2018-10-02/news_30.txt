about million tonnes of lng traded last year projects approved by seen adding million tonnes shell s approval gives credence to new wave of project approvals by sabina zawadzki london oct reuters the launch of a massive liquefied natural gas lng export project in canada has finally fired the starting gun on a wave of plan approvals around the world needed to avoid a supply crunch after
royal dutch shell said it would export lng from western canada by after approving a billion project hot on the heels of qatar s commitment last week to expand its facilities
the two announcements adding million tonnes a year mtpa to the million tonnes traded in are just the start of project approvals known as final investment decisions fids that have been waiting in company drawers while lng prices recovered from a slump
we believe could be the busiest year of lng fids ever wood mackenzie s director of north america gas dulles wang said
despite a slump in global lng prices between and many had long worried there would be a global supply gap at some point after due to broadly demand and the lack of new export projects to produce corresponding supply
several projects that had been touted for years such as shell s lng canada venture were put on the backburner
lng prices began climbing last winter and have since broadly stayed at highs seasonally driven by china s shift to gas away from coal
if you look at the demand curve and the supply coming on stream there are simply not enough projects that are being sanctioned or under development to meet demand by shell s chief financial officer jessica uhl told reporters on tuesday
shell s vote of confidence in these new market conditions now gives credence that projects with capacities of around mtpa will be approved by the end of next year as planned with most expected to be running by

qatar petroleum said it would build a fourth mega train or production facility with capacity of mtpa to bring its supply to mtpa by early more than twice china s consumption today and enough to feed china s demand that year
other large project approvals on the horizon include novatek s arctic project with mtpa capacity after the russian gas company s yamal export facility started operations smoothly and quickly at the end of last year
two projects are planned in mozambique backed by different commercial models exxon mobil s like lng canada does not make use of offtake agreements to finance it
the other is more conventional operated by anadarko
a host of approvals are also anticipated including from tellurian for the driftwood project in the first quarter of next year which is seen as a potential industry disruptor because of its lng supply pricing models
