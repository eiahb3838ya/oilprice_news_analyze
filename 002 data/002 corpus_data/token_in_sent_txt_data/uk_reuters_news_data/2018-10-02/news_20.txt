poland's power from coal seen down at 50 pct by 2040-govt official
london reuters half of poland s electricity generation will come from coal by though coal production should remain at current levels as energy demand is expected to increase a senior government official said on tuesday
poland and germany are jointly responsible for over half of the eu s carbon dioxide emissions from coal
currently around percent of poland s power production is provided by plant generation
it aims to cut that to half by with renewables and nuclear providing much of the rest and generation providing
earlier this year poland said it planned to lower the share of coal in its energy production to percent in and around percent in
we would like to keep the level of hard coal production at the level it is today
some mines will be decommissioned but demand for energy will grow
all transition in the sector will be in cooperation with the european commission piotr naimski who is responsible for strategic energy infrastructure told reuters at the bloomberg nef future of energy summit
under a plan to restructure the coal industry some of the oldest and most polluting power units could be decommissioned and replaced with bigger cleaner and more efficient units he said
poland is considering whether to open new fields of lignite an intermediate between bituminous coal and peat alongside new power units which would take around years or build a nuclear plant which would cost and take around the same
we are considering which way to go
existing lignite fields should last until the early naimski said
poland will host this year s climate talks in the mining city of katowice where the implementation of a global pact to keep global warming in check will be worked out
the pact called the paris agreement was agreed in and seeks to wean the world economy off fossil fuels in the second half of the century
president donald trump pulled the united states out of the pact last year saying it favored other countries
research by climate analytics earlier this year said the european union as a whole must shelve plans for additional coal capacity and shut down plants completely by to keep its carbon emissions in check
but poland also has plans for renewable energy
it wants to have gigawatts gw of offshore wind installed in the
it already has gw of onshore wind
at the same time it is trying to reduce its reliance on russian gas through the baltic pipe project a billion cubic meter per year pipeline which will supply natural gas from norway to the danish and polish markets
construction of the pipeline is due to start in and gas supply should start in when poland s gas contracts with russia s gazprom are scheduled to end
poland also plans to expand its liquefied natural gas lng terminal by and expand its transmission grid
we will get better security of supply and diversification of gas sources and routes
we get percent of our gas from russia now so we are looking for lng and gas from the norwegian shelf naimski said
