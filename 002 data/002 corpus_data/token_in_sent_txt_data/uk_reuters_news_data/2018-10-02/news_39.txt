analysis-too much oil? texas boom outpaces supply, transport networks
midland texas reuters the west texas drillers that drove the shale revolution have overwhelmed the region s infrastructure with oil production up costs depressing regional oil prices and slowing the pace of growth
the government continues to forecast the country s oil output rising to fresh record
but competition for limited resources in texas is making it harder for shale producers to turn a profit and encouraging some to invest elsewhere
texas is home to the permian basin the largest oil field and the centre of the country s shale industry
in the past three years production from the permian has risen a whopping million barrels per day bpd to million bpd
all that oil means pipelines from the shale patch are full so producers are paying more to transport oil on trucks and rail cars
shortages of labour water and even the fuel used in fracking are driving up production costs
at the same time permian producers are getting less for their oil which in august traded as much as a barrel below the crude benchmark
sellers have to offer the discount to compensate for the higher transport costs
we re our own worst enemy said ross craft chief executive of approach resources a small west texas oil producer which last year averaged about barrels of oil equivalent daily output
we can drill bring these wells on so quickly that we basically outpace the market
it is going to take a little bit of time he said for the infrastructure to catch up to producers
approach resources is leaving some wells uncompleted
that means the firm drills the wells but does not fracture the rock to produce the oil
other shale producers are also leaving the oil in the ground waiting for higher prices to make the drilling more profitable
the number of uncompleted wells in the permian jumped by percent to in august compared with a year earlier according to energy department data
for the rest of the united states uncompleted wells are up percent from the same period a year ago
some companies are reducing the scope of their operations in the permian
conocophillips and carrizo oil gas each moved a permian drilling rig to another oilfield and conoco idled a second the companies have said
noble energy also has cut back on its well completions and said it is moving some drilling resources to colorado
global drilling partners a drilling contractor based in the woodlands near houston was set to drill seven wells with a permian operator this july but that has dropped to two wells starting in december due to lack of pipeline takeaway said john hopkins a managing partner at the company
there will be a shift out of west texas temporarily until they can solve their midstream problems he said
companies are looking to boost their drilling in other fields in texas colorado and oklahoma he said
suppliers including sand and rail companies say they are hedging their bets by expanding elsewhere
the price discount on permian oil has hurt the share price of shale producers such as parsley energy which operates only in the permian
parsley delivered an eight in profits in the second quarter versus a year earlier and boosted output by percent over the same period
but investors have dumped the stock on concern that plans to increase output by another percent by spending percent more will deliver diminishing returns
parsley s shares are down about percent since the company reported results on
spending plans in by independent producers have risen a combined percent over to billion according to investment firm cowen co
the in august produced a record million bpd and continued investment in the permian should see the country s total output to hit an average of million bpd in
but rising costs and bottlenecks have already slowed the pace of growth
consultancy wood mackenzie estimates permian oil production in will be barrels per day bpd less than it could be because of transport constraints
permian output will be million bpd next year wood mackenzie estimates but could have been million bpd if more pipeline space were available
we ve had a more significant increase in costs this year than we would have assumed timothy dove chief executive of pioneer natural resources one of the largest permian oil producers said in august
smaller producers without contracts to use pipelines are getting hurt most because they are forced to use trucks and railcars
shipping oil by truck to gulf coast refinery and export hubs costs to a barrel compared to to a barrel by rail and less than a barrel by pipeline according to market sources
the shift is leading to traffic jams on highways and rail crossings in parts of the permian shale fields
it also means fuel for supply vehicles and fracking equipment can be in short supply locally
truck traffic is unlike anything we ve ever seen said james walter of colgate energy a based oil producer who adds his company has agreements to transport all of its crude and gas production via pipelines
rail capacity is unlikely to increase because oil producers are reluctant to sign up to contracts to lease rail cars
they would prefer to wait for the new pipelines to be built
planned pipelines out of the permian will add about million bpd of oil capacity by late estimates wood mackenzie
rail firms are reluctant to buy new oil railcars without contracts
we do think it s a situation union pacific executive vice president beth whited said in july
so we will not invest to support sand suppliers have moved quickly to alleviate one supply shortage by opening new operations
some sand mines have popped up in the permian in the past year creating a billion industry almost overnight consultancy rystad energy estimates
these mines sell sand for about a ton saving producers nearly a ton compared with sand shipped in from other states
just as elsewhere in the permian however the increase in activity is inflating costs
preferred sands which has a sand mine in monahans texas is paying workers there about percent more it does in other markets said chief executive michael o neill prompting the firm to open its next sand mine in oklahoma instead
