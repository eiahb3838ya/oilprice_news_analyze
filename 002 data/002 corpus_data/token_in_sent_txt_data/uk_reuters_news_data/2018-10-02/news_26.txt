pakistan seeks to build oil refinery near gwadar port - minister
reuters pakistan wants to build an oil refinery near the port of gwadar to reduce petroleum product imports a planning official said on tuesday as the government hosted a saudi delegation reported to be considering funding the project
pakistan is also during the saudi visit expected to seek financial assistance from its ally to avoid another bailout by the international monetary fund amid a foreign currency crisis fueled by a widening current accounts deficit
the government of new prime minister imran khan wants to turn the gwadar port into an oil city to reduce dependence on imported refined fuel khusro bakhtyar minister for planning development and reforms told reporters
the saudis were reported by pakistani newspapers dawn and the news to be considering investing in what local media say would be a refinery project
bakhtyar mentioned neither the projected cost nor any confirmed saudi investment
last month pakistan invited saudi arabia to invest in projects related to the belt and road infrastructure corridor of which the gwadar port is the crown jewel of some billion in projects in pakistan
an oil city concept has been developed for gwadar bakhtyar said saying the country can reduce its billion petroleum import bill if it imports cheaper crude oil to refine instead of more expensive finished products
if we set up a refinery and complete pakistan s requirement through our refinery this oil import bill can be cut by half
and god willing we will do khan made riyadh his first foreign trip since he swept to power in elections in july but there was no confirmation that the saudi government might offer an economic lifeline
pakistan has seen foreign reserves dwindle to about billion barely enough to meet its external debt through the end of the year and the rupee has lost more than percent of its value since december
local media have reported that islamabad is hoping for a deal for saudi oil to help shore up foreign reserves and possibly even a bridge loan of around billion but officials on both sides have not commented on any requests
