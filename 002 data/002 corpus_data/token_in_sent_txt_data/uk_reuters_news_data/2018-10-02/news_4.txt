update 3-iraq names new president and premier, ending deadlock
sulaimaniya iraq reuters iraq s parliament on tuesday elected as president kurdish politician barham salih who immediately named shi ite adel abdul mahdi prime ending months of deadlock after an inconclusive national election in may
the presidency traditionally occupied by a kurd is a largely ceremonial position but the vote for salih was a key step towards forming a new government which politicians have failed to do since the election
under iraq s constitution salih a engineer who has held office in both the iraqi federal and kurdish regional governments had days to invite the nominee of the largest parliamentary bloc to form a government
he chose to do so less than two hours after his election
since saddam hussein was toppled in a invasion power has been shared among iraq s three largest components
the most powerful post that of prime minister has traditionally been held by a shi ite arab the speaker of parliament by a sunni arab and the presidency by a kurd
a former vice president oil minister and finance minister abdul mahdi now has days to form a cabinet and present it to parliament for approval
he faces the daunting tasks of rebuilding much of the country after four years of war with islamic state militants healing its ethnic and sectarian tensions and balancing foreign relations with iraq s two major allies iran and its the united states
abdul mahdi is a trained economist who left iraq in for exile in france where he worked for and edited magazines in french and arabic
he is the son of a respected shi ite cleric who was a minister in the era of iraq s monarchy overthrown in
he will become the first elected prime minister in iraq not to hail from the shi ite islamist dawa party
abdul mahdi was nominated by two rival blocs one led by shi ite cleric moqtada and outgoing prime minister haider and the other by militia leader hadi and former premier nuri
both blocs claim to hold a parliamentary majority but the dispute has been rendered irrelevant by their choice of the same man to be premier
the nomination of mr adel abdul mahdi came after an agreement between the binaa bloc and the islah bloc to nominate him via consensus and not a majority bloc in order to get past the issue of which is the majority bloc said ahmed a spokesman for the binaa bloc led by amiri and maliki
ameri and maliki are iran s two most prominent allies in iraq
abadi was seen as the preferred candidate of the united states while sadr portrays himself as a nationalist who rejects both american and iranian influence
the rival claims to a parliamentary majority and uncertainty over the composition of the new government had raised tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services high unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after the war with islamic state
sadr s bloc welcomed abdul mahdi s nomination
the cleric earlier on tuesday tweeted that iraq is bigger than the biggest bloc a likely reference to the compromise
abadi issued a statement congratulating abdul mahdi and wishing him success
abdul mahdi s nomination represents the best choice to pleasing all the shi ite players who were about to reach a point of conflict and no return said political analyst ahmed younis
all the shiite blocs reached the conclusion that their divisions could lead to an ite conflict which would weaken their position in iraqi he said
now with abdul mahdi there are no winners and losers everyone is if the nomination of abdul mahdi diffused shi ite tensions salih s election fuelled kurdish ones
the presidency was fiercely contested between iraqi kurdistan s two main parties the patriotic union of kurdistan puk which nominated salih and its traditional rival the kurdistan democratic party kdp
salih s election raises concerns of destabilisation in the kurdistan region because of escalating tensions between the kdp and puk who fought a civil war in the
the kdp and puk were unable to iron out differences and agree on one candidate as they have traditionally done
they competed in a parliamentary election in their region in northern iraq on sunday
allegations of fraud have created tensions
results have not been announced
i promise to safeguard iraq s unity and safety salih said as he was sworn in affirming his commitment to the country s unity a year after kurds overwhelmingly backed a failed independence bid
he was the preferred candidate of most lawmakers because of his perceived softer stance on the thorny issue of kurdish independence
his opponent had served as the longtime chief of staff to former kurdistan region president and kdp leader masoud barzani who ushered in the referendum on independence last year
barzani had struck alliances with several heads of major political blocs in parliament but they were unable to whip the votes for his candidate
salih s election marked the first time in modern iraqi politics that one of the three top posts was selected without a backroom deal
even though the heads of political blocs wanted to reach a backroom deal rather than leave it up to a vote they couldn t control their own mps said renad mansour a research fellow at chatham house
mps voted for the candidate they thought was most qualified and was most in favour of a united reporting by ahmed rasheed and raya jalabi writing by ahmed aboulenein editing by andrew roche and leslie adler
