feature-with drones and lasers, costa rica seeks to track its forests
san jose oct thomson reuters foundation costa rica has long monitored its forests and the carbon they hold but it hopes to soon have a cheaper and more effective way to do it by drone
deep forest a project backed by environmental group fundecor manufacturer intel and san aerial robotixs aims to give scientists a better idea of what is happening in the country s forest canopy and allow more frequent monitoring
there are many ways of taking these metrics but none with this level of resolution said felipe carazo the executive director of fundecor a organization that works on sustainable forest management
here the advantage is the precision in a scheme that is carazo said at a congress of sustainability ecology and evolution in san jose
the project will use a drone to fly over remote areas of forest using a laser to scan the forest
the effort still in an experimental phase will scan three forests near the costa rican city of guapiles this year said its backers who are financially supporting the test
they say the method could scale up to help many countries monitor their forests more accurately a step both towards reducing emissions from forest loss and tapping into the market for carbon credits from forest protection
it could help the region to fulfill the commitments we signed in the paris agreement said timothy scott intel s governmental affairs manager
the project is not the first to use advanced technology to monitor costa rica s forests
the iraz√∫ project a forest satellite monitoring system also will track forests using a satellite launched in april
around the world drones are being used increasingly to gauge the health of forests monitor illegal deforestation and even replant forests from the air
for ruperto quesada a researcher at the center for research in forest innovation at the technological institute of costa rica tec the technologies simply reinforce monitoring of forests that has gone on for more than years in costa rica
in the end the important thing in a country like ours is to guarantee the existence of forest he said
that in itself guarantees the absorption of carbon controls soil erosion conserves biodiversity and provides other ecosystem services
in part because of its monitoring systems costa rica is the only country in latin america to substantially reverse its rate of deforestation
the area of the country covered in forest has risen from a quarter in to more than half in according to united nations data
costa rica s decades of forest monitoring data make it easier to develop algorithms to analyse drone footage and judge what is changing in the forest carazo said
but making the drone scanning technology work has been anything but simple project backers said not least because the drone needs to capture and store large amounts of data as it flies
simply flying the device at first took a big share of available processor time and when the processor was overwhelmed the drone fell scott said
the pilot could not control intel then set about increasing the capacity of the processor so that the pilot could both control the drone and at the same time scan the forest
the drones used in the project also will use a laser called lidar hd to analyse an area of forest that until now was difficult for researchers to access treetops
the lidar hd system has previously been used from airplanes or helicopters both expensive ways to gather data carazo said
putting the technology on a drone can help make the process cheaper and more frequent he said
we have been monitoring forests for more than years quesada said
the new technology will be used to reinforce not replace that work he said
