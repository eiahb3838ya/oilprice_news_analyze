venezuelan oil port repairs delayed, crude exports fall -sources
oct reuters repairs to a dock at venezuela s main oil export port will take at least another month to complete following a tanker collision more than a month ago further restraining the opec member nation s crude exports according to sources and shipping data
a minor incident in late august forced oil company pdvsa to shut the jose port s south dock one of three used to ship heavy and upgraded oil to customers including russia s rosneft and chevron corp and to receive diluents needed for the exports
jose port typically handles about percent of venezuela s total crude exports which in september declined percent compared with the previous month to million barrels per day bpd according to refinitiv eikon data
oil exports are the financial backbone of venezuela s economy which is struggling to overcome hyperinflation a recession and scarcity of basic goods
pdvsa had estimated the berth would reopen by the end of september but needed parts have not been obtained as pdvsa continues facing problems to pay foreign providers due to financial sanctions imposed by the united states sources close to its operations said
pdvsa s crews completed the removal of the damaged fences last week but replacements have not arrived in the country
the fences were bought but funds to pay the provider were retained due to the sanctions
a new deal to buy them through a third party will take at least another month one of the people familiar with the matter said
pdvsa was not immediately available for comment
president donald trump s administration last year imposed financial sanctions on venezuela and pdvsa affecting their ability to make transfers in dollars and complete payments through the banking system
pdvsa has neither resumed shipments from most of its caribbean terminals which remain frozen after producer conocophillips legal actions earlier this year to satisfy a billion arbitration award according to the data
conoco and pdvsa in august struck a payment agreement but the venezuelan oil firm has yet to complete a million installment due by the end of november to unlock its caribbean operations
venezuela s crude output fell again in august to million bpd according to official figures putting its annual average at million bpd the lowest in over six decades
economic measures recently announced by president nicolas maduro s government including a steep salary increase have fallen short for venezuela to regain access to sufficient foreign credit and reverse the downturn
