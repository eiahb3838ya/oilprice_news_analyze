expanding ethanol sales would have limited u.s. market impact -analysts
chicago reuters the trump administration s plan to allow sales of corn ethanol would have limited impact on the depressed ethanol market with record supplies and prices for the fuel hovering near the lowest in a decade analysts said
president donald trump announced the decision last week ahead of a campaign trip to iowa the top producer of corn and ethanol
with elections looming trump aimed to give a boost to corn producers in the farm belt who helped secure his narrow election victory
he said his administration would allow a waiver for sales of which was banned from june to and has about percent more ethanol than the most common gasoline formulation
the cheaper variety is not allowed in some states during the summer because its higher alcohol content can make it evaporate more quickly in warmer temperatures increasing smog
oil refiners are opposed to the move and have vowed to sue arguing that only congress can lift the ban
even if the plan moves forward by next summer and hundreds of mostly small and rural gasoline station chains install new dispensers to sell overall sales likely would increase only slightly
there are more than stations with pumps that can dispense according to the renewable fuels association trade group
that is a small portion of the estimated stations in the country according to the national association of convenience stores
rfa said the number of stations offering could double to around by late to early or percent of the total
analysts said large oil refiners were unlikely to build new infrastructure for
major fuel sellers including bp exxon mobile corp royal dutch shell plc and valero energy did not respond to requests for comment
mark lytle a vice president at pipeline and terminal operator pro petroleum said his company would consider adding ethanol tank storage if fueling stations start demanding more of the biofuel
but due to the uncertainty regarding challenges to the measure expansions in the were unlikely
lytle said it can cost to add fuel pumps tanks and other equipment investments that could take about six years to pay off with sales of
there s a lot of capital investment that s required lytle said
it s simply return on investment can i sell enough to pay for my project ethanol makers are desperate for any demand boost
supplies last week swelled to million barrels just below a record from march
the market has been under pressure since china formerly the top importer of ethanol imposed tariffs on shipments as part of the trade spat
morgan analyst ann duignan said infrastructure to dispense is insufficient
the likely impact on ethanol and corn demand in the foreseeable future is immaterial in our view she said in a note
casey s general stores inc said in a statement that it would expand offerings to as many as of its stores over the next few years
the sheetz inc gas station chain will add pumps at each of the to new stores it builds annually during the coming years said michael lorenz vice president of petroleum supply at sheetz
sheetz already offers at of its locations in the eastern united states
ethanol prices of per gallon were cents cheaper than gasoline on monday
sheetz sells at about cents less than regular gasoline
the consumer is sensitive to price when it comes to gasoline
they appreciate being offered at a lower price lorenz said
