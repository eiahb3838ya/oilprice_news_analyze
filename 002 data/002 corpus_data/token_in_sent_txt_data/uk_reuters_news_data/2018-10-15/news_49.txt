feature-crowdfunded solar panels aim to supercharge business in africa
kisii kenya oct thomson reuters foundation like many farmers in densely populated kisii county in western kenya james and janet torori long depended on bananas maize and a single dairy cow for food and income
like everyone else around here we have relied on two crops to support our family and it has not been easy earning a decent income considering that what we have been producing is what everyone else produces james torori said
but over the last year they ve found another promising source of cash using green electricity from a local solar to power a hatchery and raise chicks for sale
as part of the kuka poa smart poultry in swahili project they now earn about a month more than they once did said the couple from kebaracho village
solar power sufficient to run businesses as well as lights could help many more rural people across east africa earn a better living say officials at powerhive a microgrid power company that provided the kuka poa panels
but installing clean power requires cash and for that the company is turning to a partnership with the sun exchange a south solar energy financier
the sun exchange runs an online marketplace for solar cells where investors can buy solar equipment that is then leased to rural communities to help them run businesses
as the businesses make a profit investors get a rental income over years and poor communities get access to clean energy without the big upfront costs often associated with installing renewable energy said abe cambridge the sun exchange s ceo
investors can use anything from credit cards to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to buy solar cells with transactions managed via blockchain he said
with cryptocurrencies the market is large and you access the whole world since you are using the internet
and the investor can put in as little as which may not be possible in traditional markets cambridge explained
since it was founded in the company has raised about via the model to fund five projects in south africa generating a total of kilowatts of power
it has sold over solar cells to more than buyers in countries cambridge said
one project powers the cape town offices of southsouthnorth a south environmental group
what is fantastic about the sun exchange model is that it benefits us as the recipient of power and it benefits the people buying the solar cells and it s also a win for the environment said carl wesselink of southsouth north
the sun exchange s model of financing solar he said could help drive wider installation of solar panels and be the catalyst required for realising our distributed energy revolution
cambridge said the sun exchange s new partnership with powerhive which has operated in kenya since would aim to fund about solar projects and then hopefully grow from there
he said he hopes to raise enough cash to generate up to kilowatts of new clean power over the next five years
chris honor powerhive s ceo said his aim is to connect about new households to power by the end of
the combined attraction of earning an income and helping some of the million people living without electricity in africa should draw investors particularly those who want to be part of the energy revolution he said
he said his company has put in place in kenya have so far powered things such as hatcheries and welding shops commercial uses of energy rather than power for lights and charging mobile phones
according to william brent of power for all an organisation that promotes broader access to clean electricity crowdsourcing has become central in financing energy projects in africa and asia raising millions of dollars
in the past three years crowdsourcing has become an important tool for many companies to raise capital to connect people to electricity for the first time he said
several platforms are now offering crowdfunding for clean energy and that will continue to grow and to explore new and innovative financing models he predicted
such methods of raising funds are particularly important when many investors are still learning to fully embrace the energy systems of the future he said
