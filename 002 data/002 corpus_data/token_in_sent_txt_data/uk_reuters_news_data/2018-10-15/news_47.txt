update 1-germans to pay slightly lower levy for renewable energy in 2019
frankfurt reuters germany will cut a green energy surcharge on consumers electricity bills by percent next year but savings for households will be limited as other fees are expected to rise
germans pay the highest electricity bills in europe as taxes and fees account for over percent of power bills
german power network operators tsos said on monday that revenues collected to support green electricity are high and wholesale market prices have risen allowing renewables producers to rely less on subsidies
next year the surcharge under the renewable energy act eeg a fee that accounts for over a fifth of energy bills will fall to euro cents us cents per kilowatt hour kwh from cents this year tsos said in a statement
that was a steeper cut than forecast by industry group bee last week but may be offset by rises in other levies such as those on use of transport grids
consumers should not pin too much hope on noteworthy price cuts by their electricity suppliers said arik meyer managing director of switchup an online service for supplier switches
the portal calculated that a typical household consuming kwh per year would save just euros through the move
another portal said the bulk of network fees charged for use of transport lines for power another big cost element accounting for a quarter of bills look set to rise by percent likely eating up much of the eeg savings
the eeg fee makes up around percent of consumers final bills making it the biggest and most symbolic spending under germany s energiewende policy to transition to renewables
payouts under the eeg this year are expected to amount to over billion euros according to industry estimates
the eventual cost depends on weather patterns which determine how much renewable energy is produced and entitled to support under the eeg once it is fed into the grid
eeg payouts partly reflect the ongoing increase in renewable installations mainly wind turbines and solar panels
these receive state support in order to make them competitive with conventional energy generation whose output is priced by the wholesale market
while reforms to the eeg are gradually scaling back subsidies units constructed in recent years still fall under a rolling price guarantee that could continue to boost spending over the next few years analysts say
energy regulator the bundesnetzagentur said renewable producers will add gigawatts gw of capacity next year
