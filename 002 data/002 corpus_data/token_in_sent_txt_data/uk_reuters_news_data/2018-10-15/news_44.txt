sales fell percent to million euros
a loss is now inevitable for the nordzucker group in the current financial year due to the low sugar prices nordzucker said in a statement
given the anticipated prices an even more substantial loss is to be expected in the next financial the eu liberalised its sugar market in september ending its system of guaranteed minimum prices and protected production quotas and giving producers freedom to expand and export more and linking eu prices to world markets
but a scenario has emerged with european producers exposed to global prices which hit lows in september in an oversupplied world market
germany s largest sugar producer suedzucker has also warned its earnings will fall because of low sugar prices
the main reason for the decline in business was a significant drop in selling prices for sugar nordzucker said
we expected prices to the extent of this decline was driven by overproduction and subsidies particularly in meanwhile dry hot weather in germany and elsewhere in europe this autumn has hindered the start of this year s sugar beet harvest
this year s harvest and beet processing which started in will be affected by the unusually dry weather conditions nordzucker added
because of these conditions the campaign got off to a late start in several regions compared to the previous year and is expected to end in great regional yield disparities are anticipated
