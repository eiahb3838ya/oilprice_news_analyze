update 1-britain asks experts to advise on net zero emissions climate target
london reuters britain has asked its climate change experts to advise on whether it should set a date to meet a net zero emissions target the government said on monday
britain has a target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by percent compared with levels by but campaigners have warned this does not go far enough to meet pledges made under the paris climate agreement
the move comes a week after a united nations report warned the world needs to make unprecedented changes in the way people use energy to curb global temperature rises and limit the worst effects of climate change such as more extreme weather and loss of species
britain s energy and clean growth minister claire perry has asked the committee on climate change ccc to examine whether the target should be reviewed and if the country should set a date to meet net zero emissions
the evidence is clear governments businesses and communities must take further action to confront one of the greatest global challenges we ve ever faced perry said in a statement on monday
under the paris agreement more than nations agreed in to pursue efforts to limit a rise in global temperatures this century to degrees celsius
the ccc said it would consider how and by when britain can eliminate carbon emissions from its economy and look at whether the country s target is still fit for purpose
the committee is planning to deliver its advice within six months
