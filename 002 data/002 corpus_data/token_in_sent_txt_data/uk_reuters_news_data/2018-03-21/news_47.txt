eu lawmakers back draft rules to regulate russia's nord stream 2 pipeline
brussels march reuters eu lawmakers backed draft rules on wednesday to extend the bloc s internal energy market laws to offshore gas pipelines such as russia s planned nord stream link to germany
lawmakers on the european parliament s industry committee voted votes to in favour of the european commission s proposal with abstentions
the vote puts pressure on eu governments to also decide on a proposal on which they have so far failed to agree
the commission s proposal is supported by east european and baltic countries which fear the km mile pipeline will undercut eu efforts to reduce dependence on moscow and eu support for ukraine by depriving it of gas transit fees
the pipeline s backers including germany oppose the rule change as an attempt to block what they see as a commercial project to pump billion cubic metres of gas per year under the baltic sea
in its current form the nord stream project fully owned by russia s gas export monopoly gazprom does not comply with the eu s third energy package rules
it s too difficult to find a compromise one eu diplomat said of the last round of talks among eu nations last week
it s likely it won t go an eu legal opinion this month rejecting the proposal by the eu executive has fuelled such doubts
jerzy buzek a polish member of the european parliament who steered the file through the chamber argued the rule change would create greater investment predictability and improve competition
far too often gas supply has been used as a political weapon buzek said in a statement
we can not disarm the impure intentions of others but we can arm ourselves with full legal clarity and consistency of existing the commission last year proposed the changes to its gas directive to make all import pipelines subject to rules that require they not be owned directly by gas suppliers apply tariffs and make capacity available to third parties
eu officials say negotiations with moscow may be needed over the pipeline which begins outside eu jurisdiction on russia s shores
the draft endorsed by parliament calls for european union economic sanctions against third countries to be taken into account and any exemption for pipelines to be limited to five years and decided with the input of the commission and affected member states
