exclusive-rosneft, eni fail to discover oil at black sea well -source
moscow reuters russia s state oil company rosneft and italy s eni did not make a commercial oil discovery in the black sea as the well they were drilling proved to be dry a source close to the operations told reuters on wednesday
rosneft chief executive igor sechin has partnered with a number of foreign companies to develop russia s offshore regions though western sanctions have forced some of its partners such as exxonmobil to suspend projects
sechin has counted on the black sea as an area with high potential and any discovery would help send a message that the sanctions will not seriously hamper rosneft s global standing or cooperation with other global players
but the well which rosneft and eni started to drill in december did not bring the desired results a source close to operations said
rosneft had planned a second well if the first showed hydrocarbon potential
there will be nothing
nothing was found the source familiar with the operation said
demobilisation of equipment has eni which holds a percent stake in the project declined to comment
in the black sea rosneft faces a technically challenging project
not a single well has been drilled in the deep water russian offshore in the black sea sechin said back in december
the prospecting and appraisal well was drilled using the rig and rosneft said this week it had a target depth of metres
contrary to previous statements when rosneft has discovered oil on wednesday the company confirmed that drilling was complete and referred only to finding a carbonate structure
as a result of the work a unique carbonate structure was discovered which is a fractured reservoir that is highly likely to contain hydrocarbons rosneft said without giving details of how much or what type of hydrocarbons the structure may contain
the obtained results inspire confidence in the discovery of large oil and gas deposits in the russian area of the black sea rosneft said adding that it will now carefully study the material received by the drilling
the wording contrasts with rosneft s statement following the completion of drilling on the first well in its kara sea project in september
back then rosneft reported it found oil and sechin took a group of reporters and tv crews to the kara sea
valery nesterov an analyst with sberbank cib said that given there was no information about any oil flow from the well rosneft may need additional drilling
the issue of carbonate structures is a high oil movement inside a layer nesterov said
the high movement means that oil can migrate from one part of the structure to another and can be hard to track if at all
according to thomsonreuters tracking data the rig started to move to the romanian port of constanta on march and is expected to arrive there on march
eni in contrast to its global peers does not yet have any oil producing projects in russia and has teamed up with rosneft in the black sea and the barents sea in russia s arctic
nesterov said that it was important to note that eni has not pulled out of the partnership with rosneft despite what he described as not very active cooperation
eni does not announce the exit and this is positive he said
rosneft said last december that oil resources in the licence area in the black sea were estimated at over million tonnes or equal to more than two years of rosneft s current oil production
the partnership has yet to begin drilling in the barents sea
