update 1-norway's planned power cable to uk may be scrapped-lawmaker
adds quotes detail by lefteris karagiannopoulos oslo march reuters northconnect a planned private power cable between norway and scotland due to enter operations by could be cancelled as a result of norway s adoption of the eu s latest energy legislation the leader of the norwegian parliament s energy committee said on wednesday
if the project is to go ahead it would need to be transferred to grid statnett espen barth eide also said a day ahead of a vote in parliament regarding norway s adoption of the eu s third energy package
it will have to be transferred to statnett eide said
it s statnett or nothing
of course that will not automatically mean it will be built for sure
it will be eide is a member of the main opposition labour party whose support is needed by norway s minority government to approve the latest eu energy legislation required to maintain access and equal trade terms for its companies in the common market
labour agreed to back the government on the vote but demanded concessions to secure norway s energy sovereignty including allowing only power cables to be built
norway s influential energy unions have long lobbied against private cables which were legalised under the previous government
overturning that decision has been one of the labour party s promises before national elections last september
northconnect s current owners are norway s agder energi lyse and as well as sweden s vattenfall
even if statnett does take control of the project the cable will be delayed eide said
in any case northconnect will come later than the original plan
it will be years
firstly we will have to assess statnett s cables that are now under construction he said
another labour demand is postponing decisions to construct any future cables until statnett completes two interconnectors it is currently building to britain and germany
after these are built their impact will be evaluated and only then can the norwegian state decide to proceed with any other cables said eide
there have been concerns that british plans for more power links with europe to avert a looming electricity shortfall could be hindered if the country no longer has a say in european union regulation of networks and power trading
britain faces an energy supply crunch by the early as coal power stations close and its oil and gas production declines
to help boost supply it plans new interconnectors with france denmark belgium and norway to provide up to gigawatts of additional capacity
its current four interconnectors with europe provide around gw of capacity
but if britain leaves the eu it might have to leave the bloc s internal energy market iem which coordinates access to energy across the eu
