pttep has bln in cash seeks to extend itself reduces avg cost to in from seeks pct stake in petronas sk gas block plans to develop gas to power project in myanmar eyes expiring concessions in mideast to add to output writes through adds graphic and picture links by florence tan kuala lumpur march reuters thailand s ptt exploration and production pttep is looking closer to home for upstream oil and gas assets in a drive to boost its reserves and production as oil prices have recovered a senior company executive said on wednesday
global oil futures that have held above a barrel and sharp in the upstream sector are encouraging national oil companies and international majors to pump money into exploration and production although many producers remain wary that surging oil output could hold crude prices back
since the oil crisis that began in and saw prices slump to less then a barrel in early pttep has cut costs and increased efficiency bringing its average cost of oil and gas output to per barrel last year down from per barrel
now we re coming back more to the region
we re good friends with malaysia s petronas but we didn t really do things together
now we have more collaboration and we have a project to work together phongsthorn thavisin pttep s president of exploration and production said on the sidelines of the otc asia conference
pttep which has billion cash on hand is also eyeing expiring middle east concessions that can boost its output immediately and plans to invest in a project in myanmar by tapping into gas from blocks and to meet its neighbour s energy demand phongsthorn said
we re looking to extend ourselves a little he said
still ratings agency fitch expects pttep s reserve profile to remain weak for the next two years as the majority of its assets are located in thailand where oil and gas reservoirs are scattered and relatively small
pttep has already invested in percent of train of malaysia lng and is exploring offshore block in sarawak with petronas phongsthorn said
the company is also in the second round of bidding for a stake in another offshore sarawak block seeking a percent share he said
last year petroliam nasional bhd petronas kicked off a process to sell a stake of up to percent worth an estimated billion in the offshore gas block in malaysia s sarawak state
total and some japanese firms are among others keen to bid for the asset sources have said
pttep also plans to bid for thailand s erawan and bongkot gas concession licences in an auction scheduled for april another chance to raise its output and reserves
the government will announce the licence winners in december which will give the companies time to invest to sustain a combined gas output of billion cubic feet a day from the fields before the concessions expire in phongsthorn said
pttep holds an percent stake in a billion liquefied natural gas lng project led by anadarko petroleum in mozambique
the consortium will build two lng trains with a total capacity of million tonnes per annum that are slated for completion in
we are still trying to work out if ptt could commit its volume from mozambique either for thailand or trading phongsthorn said
the lng market in the next few years could see more demand and supply could shrink a little
everyone stopped investing for some time and our industry needs time to develop assets
i think in the future you ll see short supply he said
pttep is also exploring solar power and batteries technologies for new revenue stream as it adapts itself to a new environment phongsthorn said
falling costs for solar panels have made them a viable electricity source and oil companies expect electric vehicles to reduce oil demand after
