u.s. lawmakers launch bill bolstering nuclear proliferation safeguards
washington march reuters lawmakers introduced a bill on wednesday to ensure that countries striking deals with washington on sharing nuclear power technology abandon activities that could be altered to make material for nuclear weapons

representatives ileana a republican and brad sherman a democrat introduced the bill as officials from saudi arabia work with the administration of president donald trump on a deal that could relax safeguards on nuclear proliferation
the bill would reform current nuclear energy law to force countries in nuclear partnerships to renounce the pursuit of enrichment and preprocessing technologies and capabilities
the bill also requires a stronger approval process by congress of civilian nuclear deals
saudi arabia has previously refused to sign any agreement with washington that would deprive it of the possibility of one day enriching uranium
although the bill faces an uncertain future it sends a message to both saudi arabia and the trump administration that congress could take steps against any deal that lacks the safeguards which are known as gold standard of any agreement
some lawmakers are concerned that if saudi arabia and other countries are allowed to enrich uranium that it could one day lead to a nuclear weapons race in the middle east
congress must ensure that national security interests are not trumped by political concerns said sherman
the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the bill
saudi arabia said it needs nuclear power to move away from burning crude oil to generate electricity and to diversify its economy
earlier this month its cabinet approved a national policy program that limits all nuclear activities to peaceful purposes
still saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman told cbs in an interview on sunday ahead of a trip to washington that the kingdom will develop nuclear weapons if its iran does so
a deal could breathe some life into the nuclear power industry which is suffering from an abundance of cheap natural gas a competing fuel for electricity and ballooning safety costs
rick perry the energy secretary met in london early this month with saudi officials to discuss the deal
and sherman also sent a letter to perry urging the trump administration to seek for binding commitments against enrichment and reprocessing in its talks with saudi arabia
the energy department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter
