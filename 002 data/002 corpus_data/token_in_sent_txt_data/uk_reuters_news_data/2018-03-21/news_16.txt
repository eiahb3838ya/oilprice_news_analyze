update 2-mexico regulator wants minority stake floated in state oil firm pemex
london reuters the head of mexico s national hydrocarbons commission cnh urged the government on wednesday to float a minority stake in national oil and gas firm pemex on the mexican stock exchange
pemex controls the majority of hydrocarbon reserves in mexico although the sector has been open to foreign investment in the past four years but it lacks funds to properly explore and develop the assets the regulator said
juan carlos zepeda president commissioner of cnh which is in charge of mexico s contracts with foreign energy firms said constitutional changes were needed to allow a stake in pemex to be sold while keeping the company under state control
allow pemex to place shares in the market and raise capital he told reuters in london adding he expected a more successful ipo than the one by brazil s petrobras in
petrobras raised billion from its stake sale
mexican president enrique nieto said in before he was elected that pemex could emulate the petrobras ipo
but there has been little discussion of a sale since mexico opened up the energy industry to private investment under its reforms
the in mexico s election in july leftist andres manuel lopez obrador has been skeptical of nieto s energy reforms
regardless of the political party regardless of the administration there is no other alternative to make pemex successful zepeda said adding pemex will keep deteriorating if it did not raise capital in the market
pemex production had fallen from about million barrels per day bpd in to about million bpd now zepeda said adding pemex could exceed previous output peaks with more investment
pemex has all the reserves the best exploration areas but pemex needs to move faster
pemex needs to be able to invest more he said adding pemex would benefit from farming out an industry term for offering stakes in blocks to other investors
pemex needs more capital to invest in its own projects the regulator said adding pemex needed to at least triple its annual capital spending that was now about billion a year
lopez obrador has said he would stop two oil and gas field auctions scheduled for july and september if elected
asked about those plans zepeda said the bidding process had already begun adding once you start the bidding process the only authority responsible for the bidding is cnh
so only cnh could stop the bidding reporting by shadia nasralla editing by toby chopra and edmund blair
