the move to tackle such projects comes in the wake of the oil price crash which devastated the region s oilfield services sector after producers sharply cut back spending on oil and gas exploration
we re cautiously optimistic on the region because projects are slowly coming back
we also see some smaller projects in size not by nocs national oil companies or iocs international oil companies but by smaller operators leng said
bhge is currently working with private australian company twinza oil which is developing the first offshore field for papua new guinea providing fullstream services from assessing reserves to drilling and building the gas processing plant
