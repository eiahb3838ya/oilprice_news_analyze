rpt-analysis-china stays on the sidelines as venezuela spirals downward
repeats to widen distribution with no changes by corina pons and chen aizhu march reuters china is likely to extend an agreement proving venezuela with favorable loans repayment terms but will not lend fresh funds to president nicolas maduro s government according to sources in caracas and beijing familiar with the situation
during a decade china plowed more than billion into the opec member s coffers through agreements that helped beijing secure energy supplies for its economy while bolstering an ally in latin america
but the flow of cash halted nearly three years ago when venezuela asked for a change of payment terms when a fall in oil prices and declining crude output pushed its economy into a hyperinflationary collapse
though unwilling to throw venezuela a financial lifeline the china development bank cdb will likely extend next month a grace period begun in that allows venezuela to make only interest payments on its loans the sources said
however china has ignored several requests for new funding
given venezuela s falling oil production it s natural for chinese banks not to renew loans said one chinese oil industry source who asked not to be identified
a second oil industry source asked if the conditions would be tightened cited a chinese proverb saying china would not drop stones on somebody who has fallen into a venezuela still owes china billion according to one venezuelan finance industry source who has tracked the information via contacts in both countries
some billion of that is owed under the billion large volume long term fund signed in
a further billion remains outstanding under the joint china venezuela fund via three tranches of billion to billion each according to the source
china s policy is not to lend new funds until old loans have been paid off which can not happen under the scheme created in april because the outstanding balance does not change
cdb president zheng zhijie asked by reuters if the bank was having second thoughts about financing venezuela given its situation said we ve done our assessment of its political and economic situation
we re just monitoring however one diplomatic source familiar with chinese thinking on venezuela said china increasingly sees maduro as similar to former zimbabwe president robert mugabe who was pushed out after years in power that dragged his country into hyperinflation and economic crisis
china would have no concern about abandoning maduro as it did mugabe when he was ousted the source said but does not expect china to take an active role in pushing him out
china looks at venezuela as another zimbabwe a poor return on its investment he said
venezuela s information ministry did not reply to a request for comment
china s foreign ministry said in a statement that bilateral cooperation was proceeding smoothly at present adding that china will continue to carry out pragmatic cooperation with prominent chinese ratings agency dagong global credit rating co in november put venezuela s sovereign debt on negative watch in a scathing review that warned of high default risks on bonds which are not linked to financing arrangements with beijing
venezuela lacks the ability to create wealth on its own while debt repayment sources are highly fragile thus a low solvency dagong wrote
sanctions levied by the government of president donald trump have left venezuela unable to refinance its crippling debt burden and left it struggling to import basic goods such as food
beijing has also declined to renew financing to state oil company pdvsa that is tied to oil industry investment according to venezuelan finance industry sources in contrast to other loans that are used for a broader range of expenditures
pdvsa in december paid off a billion loan that it received in but was unable to renew it
the loan is paid off in cash rather than in oil which made it less attractive the source said
venezuela has in recent months proposed different arrangements under which china would put in new cash including renewing part of the billion large volume fund according to venezuelan finance industry sources
those requests have been ignored the sources said
but despite china s discontent halting the grace period would have little practical benefit because it would most likely lead caracas to get behind on payments something it has done in the past
in order to enforce its claims china would have to open a cumbersome commercial dispute and engage in an unfriendly process of forcibly collecting on the loans embarrassing a government that it actively supported for years
venezuela as of last year had fallen behind on oil shipments to china as well as russia another ally that has been providing financing according to internal documents seen by reuters
