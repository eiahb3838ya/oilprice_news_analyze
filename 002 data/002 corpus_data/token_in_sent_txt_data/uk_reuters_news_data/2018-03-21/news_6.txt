update 5-drillers give tepid response to record u.s. offshore lease sale
reuters oil and gas drillers bid on only a tiny fraction of gulf of mexico acreage offered on wednesday in the largest lease sale in american history a setback to the trump administration s efforts to rapidly pump up investment in the region
the interior department had offered up a record million acres million hectares for development in the gulf an area twice the size of florida with discounted royalty rates on the shallower tracts as part of a broader effort by president donald trump to ramp up fossil fuels output
but companies facing dollar price tags to develop the acreage and tempted by better terms overseas bid on just percent of the area up for grabs winning with bids that averaged just an acre percent below levels last year and a fraction of those in the region in when oil prices were higher according to the data
in all the auction yielded million in winning bids slightly more than a smaller gulf of mexico auction last year but a tenth of the amount pulled in during a much smaller lease sale in the central gulf in
the interior department s bureau of ocean energy management which administered the auction characterized the results as robust i think we re seeing continued consistent investment in the gulf of mexico boem spokesman mike celata said in a conference call with reporters adding he forecast increasing oil and gas production from the region for years
he said companies including majors royal dutch shell plc bp plc chevron corp and total sa had placed bids on blocks
but critics of the administration called the unusually large lease sale
crude oil and natural gas output is already smashing records thanks to improved drilling technology that has opened up cheaper onshore reservoirs and brazil and mexico are also competing for drilling investment in their own deepwater acreage often with better terms
offering a nearly unrestricted supply in a low demand market with a cut rate royalty and almost no competition is bad policy and an inexcusable waste of taxpayer resources the center for american progress a policy think tank said in a statement
william turner senior research analyst at wood mackenzie said the sales statistics were on par with the lows that we saw last year referring to a lease sale in that had yielded million in winning bids
interior secretary ryan zinke had said ahead of the sale that the offering would be a bellwether of industry demand in the region and billed the effort as a way to help the united states become more energy after the sale interior assistant secretary joe balash said today s lease sale is yet another step our nation has taken to achieve economic security and energy lows the government offers gulf of mexico leases annually but usually in smaller regional batches
an auction in march for example offered up million acres in the central gulf of mexico planning region
consultancy wood mackenzie had expected demand for the acreage to get a boost from higher oil prices compared with a year ago and lower corporate taxes
but it pointed out interest would be tempered by competition from latin america and concerns over the impact that tariffs on steel imports could have on costs
the national ocean industries association which represents offshore drillers also sounded a note of caution
the united states must continue to evaluate how to keep the gulf of mexico and other parts of the outer continental shelf attractive in light of competition from brazil and mexico it said in an emailed statement
drillers have been trying to trim their gulf of mexico drilling costs in recent years to make certain projects there more competitive
bp for example has said its mad dog platform will be economic with crude at just a barrel
current oil prices are over a barrel
bp which bid over million on parcels on wednesday structured its bids around its existing production platforms and areas it has already identified as being highly prospective spokesman jason ryan said in a statement
still many new projects in the deepwater gulf of mexico come with dollar price tags and require major investment up front making them a tough sell
some oil companies like exxon mobil corp are focusing on new deepwater projects outside of the united states where royalties and tax structures can be more favorable
in terms of exxon they have plenty of things to do in guyana so why bother getting too active in this round in gulf of mexico said lysle brinker a research director at ihs markit noting exxon s absence from the bidding
in an effort to pump up interest the interior department had cut the royalty rate companies must pay in shallow offshore waters by a third to percent and is considering cutting the rate for deeper waters too
the boem s celata pointed out that tracts received bids on wednesday an increase from past lease sales that he attributed to the lower royalty rates
the administration is eyeing further vast lease sales offshore in the future having proposed opening up parts of the arctic atlantic and pacific an idea that has faced pushback from several governors in coastal states
democratic lawmakers have also warned the interior department not to extend the lower royalty rates to deepwater acreage saying the move would taxpayers
