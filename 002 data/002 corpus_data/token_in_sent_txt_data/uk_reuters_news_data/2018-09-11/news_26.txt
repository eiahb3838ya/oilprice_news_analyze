world's local governments rally in california to fight climate change
san francisco sept thomson reuters foundation local authorities will carve out a larger role in fighting rising temperatures globally as national governments have been slow to take action said organizers of a climate change summit beginning on wednesday in san francisco
about delegates from city and regional governments as well as industries and research institutions will attend the global climate action summit which was put together by californian authorities and the united nations
the gathering will deepen the leadership of authorities in curbing climate change a battle that almost nations have also joined under the paris climate accord according to organizers
we re moving into a new wave a new phase of stepped up climate action said summit spokesman nick nuttall adding that the event is expected to yield joint pledges to limit temperature increases
the gathering reflects a desire to bypass the slow progress of national governments in implementing paris agreement goals said michael burger executive director of the sabin center for climate change law at new york s columbia university
the paris pact aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to well below degrees celsius fahrenheit and ideally to degrees celsius with a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century
the agreement is due to come into force in
but negotiations over how to roll out the treaty have exposed disagreements about funding for developing countries
this week s summit in california is heavy with symbolism as the united states is the only country to announce its intention to withdraw from the paris pact following a decision by president donald trump last year
it can be and should be seen as a response to the abdication of leadership by the federal government which has really created a vacuum for leadership burger told the thomson reuters foundation
the gathering follows a summer marked by mounting signs of a rapidly warming atmosphere
record heatwaves and wildfires this summer have been linked to temperatures worldwide
local government administrators are expected to announce initiatives about electric vehicles and forest conservation while companies will likely pledge to roll back greenhouse gas emissions nuttall said
national governments from more than a dozen countries including china and britain are also sending representatives
china s presence is to be particularly heavy and it will have its own pavilion on the sidelines of the gathering
china is the world s largest emitter of greenhouse gasses followed by the united states according to the world resources institute a washington research organization
chinese officials saw the meeting as a way to make real progress outside of political circles in washington said daniel sperling a professor of environmental sciences at the university of california davis
they like very much working with us in california because it s below the radar it s not white house politics said sperling who is also a member of the california air resources board the state s clean air regulator
california s governor jerry brown defied the government s retreat from the paris pact by branding it insane and immediately flying to china to foster greater cooperation on clean energy
the gathering brown said in a phone interview was not designed to sway trump s opinion on climate change
but he said he hoped it would awaken other members of the republican party to the existential threat of global warming and to its economic potential ahead of a general election to be held in november
we are late and we have to accelerate our efforts to reduce emissions he said
policies encouraging bus transportation green buildings and clean energy could generate million jobs in cities globally by offsetting job losses in the energy industry according to a report this week by a network of large global cities
