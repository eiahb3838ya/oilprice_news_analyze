analysis-canada's ultra-cheap natural gas drives hopes of petrochemical boom
aug reuters canada s province of alberta is looking to recreate the building boom spreading along the gulf coast where inexpensive natural gas generated billions of dollars in investment by petrochemical companies
the adoption by drillers of fracking technology to unlock oil and gas from shale rock expanded production dramatically starting a decade ago
that abundance has generated billion since in announced capital investment to build or expand chemical plants that use gas to make plastics fertilizer and fuel according to the american chemistry council
alberta hopes to do the same thing turning prices that are about those at the gulf coast into a competitive advantage to attract petrochemical companies
such investment would provide a badly needed market for oil and gas within the landlocked province where energy companies struggle to reach buyers farther away
alberta in launched incentives to diversify its economy
two projects including inter pipeline ltd s planned c billion billion petrochemical plant near edmonton have been approved to share c million in royalty credits
alberta solicited bids for a second subsidy round in june
they re getting all kinds of expressions of interests david podruzny of business and economics at the chemical industry association of canada said in an interview
as attractive as cheap gas is skeptics say alberta s incentives fall short of those in the gulf and the province also has the disadvantages of higher costs and inadequate infrastructure
but companies are chasing opportunities even without government help
cf industries holdings inc is boosting ammonia fertilizer production by short tons annually at its medicine hat alberta plant starting later this year
the lower cost allows it to ship farther than usual to farmers in the state of iowa
at times it s free said bert frost cf s senior of sales of alberta s gas
we have the gas in the world fertilizer producer nutrien ltd has begun analyzing a potential expansion in alberta chief executive chuck magro said
he expects the abundance of cheap gas to persist even if the billion lng canada terminal for liquified natural gas is built in coming years creating a new export outlet
our analysis is you would need to build several lng terminals before we would see much higher gas prices he said in an interview this month
i m quite bearish for natural gas in western canada for the foreseeable methanex corp which makes a liquid chemical called methanol is considering a second plant in medicine hat said paul daoust for north america
canada is the world s gas producer but much of the gas it used to sell into the northeastern united states has been displaced by expanding supplies
an incentive program spanning up to a decade and competitive with what is available along the gulf coast is necessary to offset alberta s higher capital costs said lori kent executive director of resource diversification council
insufficient pipeline infrastructure is also holding the province back said john rogers senior at credit ratings agency moody s
low prices have been a hardship for gas producers and prolonged weakness could force them to reduce supplies
crew energy inc has already shut in dry gas wells this year said chief executive dale shwed
if companies are not going to make money producing gas and selling it they re not going to drill for it shwed said
