china's hebei plans more rail, river freight to cut truck pollution
shanghai reuters the chinese province of hebei is aiming to slash road freight in favor of rail and river transport over the next years as part of efforts to improve air quality officials said
hebei which surrounds the capital beijing is on the front line of china s efforts to improve it s poor air quality and has been under pressure to restrict industrial output cut coal consumption and curb traffic
the province has vowed to cut concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as by a further percent over although they would still be at more than five times the world health organisation s recommended level
in a local briefing on tuesday officials said hebei will accelerate construction of new rail links in the next two years to reduce road freight according to a transcript published on the provincial government s website on wednesday
exhaust emissions from road freight vehicles especially and diesel trucks are one of the main sources of atmospheric pollution said song shuqiang of the province s transportation bureau
hebei will improve port infrastructure to facilitate the change and shift deliveries of iron ore to steel mills to rail
it aims to raise the rail delivery capacity for iron ore shipped from the major port of caofeidian to million tonnes by next year up from about million tonnes this year song said
by all major deliveries of iron ore and coking coal from the ports of huanghua and tangshan which includes caofeidian will be by rail or waterways rather than roads he added
in the first half of the year percent of the province s total freight was delivered by road with just percent by rail
hebei came under pressure to cut pollution by percent over the period
it met the target with blanket curbs on industrial enterprises coal consumers and traffic but has since vowed to adopt a more targeted approach
the latest moves are in line with a national plan to boost rail freight levels by as much as percent by with trucks blamed for producing times more pollution per unit of cargo than trains
hebei s major industries like steel and coking coal would also face far tougher standards in the coming two to three years said gao jianmin the head of hebei s environment bureau
steel mills will have to slash dust emissions fourfold and sulfur dioxide sixfold he said
