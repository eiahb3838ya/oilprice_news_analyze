after trump attack on russia ties, merkel eyes azeri gas
berlin reuters castigated by president donald trump as relying too much on russian gas supplies german chancellor angela merkel heads to azerbaijan this week to discuss the development of a southern pipeline to deliver gas to europe from the caspian
the visit underscores merkel s openness to finding alternative sources of affordable gas even as she remains committed to the nord stream pipeline which will carry gas directly from russia under the baltic sea to germany
we have a big interest in further developing the southern corridor a senior german government official said
this is part of the eu s diversification strategy of getting gas from other regions not just russia to in baku merkel will discuss energy issues including improving the infrastructure to help transport gas from azerbaijan to europe via turkey officials said
azerbaijan looks set to play a crucial role as it plans to launch the second stage of a gas pipeline from the vast shah deniz field to europe
shah deniz ii is expected to produce billion cubic metres bcm of gas a year from with bcm earmarked for europe and bcm for turkey and georgia
later gas could be brought from turkmenistan iran and iraq to europe
in a sign of progress iran russia kazakhstan turkmenistan and azerbaijan agreed in principle this month on how to divide the potentially huge oil and gas resources of the caspian sea
however the southern pipeline is dwarfed by nord stream a gazprom initiative that will double russia s export capacity to europe to bcm
that pipeline is welcomed by much of german industry which wants as much cheap gas as possible
last month trump who is pressing germany to buy more liquefied natural gas lambasted germany as being a captive of russia due to its dependence on russian energy a charge germany denies
trump has called nord stream horrific
germany imported percent of its gas from russia in the first half of figures from state foreign trade authority bafa showed
merkel discussed energy in talks with russian president vladimir putin at a palace outside berlin at the weekend
she is trying to assuage some nord stream critics by ensuring ukraine does not suffer from lower gas transit revenues
merkel also travels to georgia and armenia on her trip which starts on thursday
she will hold talks with azeri president ilham aliyev on saturday
