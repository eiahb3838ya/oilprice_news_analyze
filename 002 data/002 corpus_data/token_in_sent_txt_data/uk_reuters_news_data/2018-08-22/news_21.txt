update 2-japanese nuclear power companies in talks over alliance -source
reuters four of japan s biggest nuclear operators and plant builders have started talks on a potential partnership in atomic energy as the sector struggles to reboot in the wake of the fukushima disaster seven years ago a source said on wednesday
tokyo electric power company holdings inc tepco hitachi ltd toshiba and chubu electric power co inc have signed an initial agreement that will be fleshed out in discussions the source told reuters
he declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media
the nikkei newspaper earlier reported the companies had begun talks on an alliance that would initially focus on decommissioning old reactors
that could be extended to building and maintaining nuclear plants with the moves likely to spur a broad realignment in japan s nuclear industry the nikkei reported
it makes sense in the domestic arena to cooperate
four balance sheets is better than one when it comes to nuclear risks said tom o sullivan the founder of energy consultancy mathyos japan
when contacted by reuters all four companies said they had regular discussions with each other as well as with other nuclear operators and builders
hitachi denied the details included in the nikkei report on plans for decommissioning and the building of new reactors
japan s nuclear sector provided about percent of the country s electricity supply before a tsunami and earthquake caused reactor fuel meltdowns at tepco s fukushima daiichi station in march
the disaster highlighted regulator and industry failings and turned swathes of the public against nuclear power with all reactors needing to be relicensed by a new regulator to meet tougher safety standards
while nine reactors have been restarted utilities have had to spend billions of dollars on upgrades and alternative fuel supplies to produce electricity in the world s economy
that has led to calls for the government to take over nuclear operations and reorganize an industry that has atomic power operators
japan s powerful ministry of economy trade and industry meti supports the partnership plans the nikkei report said quoting an unidentified official saying it is now impossible for a private company to be in the business by an official at meti declined to comment on talks between private companies and denied it was leading the moves when contacted by reuters declining to be identified
the shakeup in japan s energy industry sparked by fukushima has already led to tepco and chubu to merging their fossil fuel power businesses under a venture called jera that is due to complete the takeover of their coal gas and oil generation assets in april next year
tepco and chubu two of japan s biggest three utilities have yet to restart any nuclear units and are meeting strong resistance from local populations to any restarts
the utilities both use the same basic boiling water reactor technology supplied by toshiba and hitachi which built all their nuclear units
japan had operational reactors before the disaster but utilities have announced plans to decommission nine units in the aftermath in addition to the six reactors at fukushima where a decades long is in progress
hitachi shares closed percent higher while chubu shares dropped percent and tepco gained percent
toshiba was unchanged with the nikkei climbing percent
