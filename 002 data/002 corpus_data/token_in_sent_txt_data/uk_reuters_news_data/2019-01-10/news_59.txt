column-asian refiners lose in crude tug-of-war between opec+ and trump: russell
launceston australia reuters the emerging dynamic for crude oil markets this year is the struggle between opec and its allies for higher prices against the vocal push for low prices from president donald trump
much has already been written on which side is likely to prevail but in the meantime the losers are refiners in asia who face crude prices likely to be higher relative to those in europe and the americas
this is likely because asian refiners will bear the brunt of lower supplies from opec s middle east producers as well as russia while at the same time being unable to take full advantage of cheaper shale crude oil
while more crude is expected to flow to asia in coming months because of the discount of west texas intermediate to the global light crude benchmark brent it remains questionable as to whether this will offset lower supplies from the middle east
differences in crude quality also aren t working in favour of asian refiners given the preference of many for heavier sour crudes such as those typically supplied by top middle east exporters such as saudi arabia iraq and iran
while there may be more crude available at competitive prices in asia there may not be the appetite for it among many refiners given their plants are optimised to run on heavier grades
and those heavier grades are looking more expensive as demand for them rises and opec and its allies cut output
opec oil production slumped by the most in almost two years in december with the reduction coming ahead of a formal agreement between the producer organisation and its allies including russia
opec pumped million barrels per day bpd last month according to a reuters survey published on down bpd from november and the largest drop since january
opec russia and other an alliance known as agreed in december to reduce supply by million bpd in from november levels starting this month
opec s share of that cut is bpd
the cuts are making middle east heavier crudes lose their price advantage to lighter grades
dubai mercantile exchange dme futures for oman crude for march settlement ended at a barrel on wednesday while the similar brent contract was at a discount of just
six months ago brent was at a barrel while dme oman was at a significantly deeper discount
the erosion of oman s price advantage to brent leaves many asian refiners with little choice but to pay relatively more for their crude supplies
even if they can switch to using lighter crude grades they end up producing more gasoline than desired and not enough middle distillates such as diesel and jet kerosene
while the profit margin or crack for a singapore refinery producing diesel from dubai crude is off its november peak of a barrel at the close of on wednesday it is still comfortably above the profit on gasoline
producing a barrel of gasoline from brent crude in singapore actually yielded a loss of cents a barrel on wednesday down from the peak last year of a profit of reached on
the contrasting fortunes of gasoline and middle distillates in asia is a reflection of the struggles asian refiners are having in adapting to the conflicting aims of the governments of the major oil producers namely the united states russia and saudi arabia
throw in uncertainty over what happens in april when waivers over iran s crude exports end and the picture clouds further for asian refiners who buy about of the oil exported from the middle east
it s not a situation of their making but asia s refiners are caught between the moves to boost oil prices and trump s twitter onslaught aimed at keeping them low
and the geopolitics of trump s renewed sanctions against iran over its nuclear programme the war in syria and the ongoing fallout from the killing by saudi agents of journalist jamal khashoggi in turkey add to the brew of uncertainty
