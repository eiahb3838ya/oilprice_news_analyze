oceans warming faster than expected, set heat record in 2018 -scientists
oslo reuters the oceans are warming faster than previously estimated setting a new temperature record in in a trend that is damaging marine life scientists said on thursday
new measurements aided by an international network of floats deployed in the oceans since showed more warming since than calculated by the latest assessment of climate change in they said
and observational records of ocean heat content show that ocean warming is accelerating the authors in china and the united states wrote in the journal science of ocean waters down to meters ft
greenhouse gas emissions are warming the atmosphere according to the overwhelming majority of climate scientists and a large part of the heat gets absorbed by the oceans
that in turn is forcing fish to flee to cooler waters
global warming is here and has major consequences already
there is no doubt none the authors wrote in a statement
almost nations plan to phase out fossil fuels this century under the paris climate agreement to limit warming
president donald trump who wants to promote fossil fuels plans to pull out of the pact in
data due for publication next week will show was the warmest year on record for the global ocean surpassing said lead author lijing cheng of the institute of atmospheric physics at the chinese academy of sciences
he told reuters that records for ocean warming had been broken almost yearly since
overall temperatures in the ocean down to meters rose about degree celsius from he said
the assessment estimated slower rates of heat uptake but did not give a single comparable number
a separate study on monday by the european union s copernicus climate change service said was the fourth warmest year for global surface temperatures in records dating back to the century
ocean temperatures are less influenced by variations in the weather
it can take more than years for deep ocean temperatures to adjust to changes at the surface
the deep ocean reflects the climate of the deep and uncertain past kevin trenberth of the national center for atmospheric research and a of thursday s study told reuters
among effects extra warmth can reduce oxygen in the oceans and damages coral reefs that are nurseries for fish the scientists said
warmer seas release more moisture that can stoke more powerful storms
warmer ocean water also raises sea levels by melting ice including around the edges of antarctica and greenland
