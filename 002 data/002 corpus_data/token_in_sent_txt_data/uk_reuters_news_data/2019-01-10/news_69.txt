the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london jan reuters natural gas prices have fallen sharply as the unusual cold weather of late november and early december has given way to temperatures in the last four weeks
futures prices for gas delivered at henry hub in february have fallen below per million british thermal units from a peak of almost in the middle of november
the exceptional rally in gas prices during the late summer and early autumn has unwound leaving gas prices back at the low level that has prevailed for the last three years
cumulative heating demand for the heating season was around percent higher than the average through according to the government climate prediction center
but the sustained period of cold in late autumn and early winter has been replaced by an extended period of mild weather and cumulative heating demand has now dropped percent below normal degree days statistics cpc
government forecasts show average or temperatures expected across most of the major population centres of the united states for much of the next three months
so far this winter gas stocks have fallen much less for any given level of heating demand than in the previous heating seasons which has also helped rebalance the market
surging gas prices have encouraged electricity generators to run units for fewer hours in the fourth quarter and turn to units instead cutting gas consumption and making scarce stocks go further
working gas stocks in underground storage were billion cubic feet percent below the previous average in according to data from the energy information administration
by the end of the year however the deficit had eased to just billion cubic feet percent due to warmer weather and a reduction in hours by generators weekly natural gas storage report eia
the rise and fall in gas prices has been accentuated by the accumulation and subsequent liquidation of hedge fund positions since the end of july and especially since the end of september
hedge fund managers correctly anticipated a shortage of gas this winter and the likelihood price spikes would be needed to eke out the low stocks left at the end of the refill season
fund managers were net buyers of futures and options equivalent to billion cubic feet of gas between late july and according to position data from the commodity futures trading commission
by the middle of november fund managers held almost bullish long positions for every one bearish short positions the most biggest bullish imbalance since at least
between and however as electric generators curbed their gas consumption and temperature forecasts became milder portfolio managers turned net sellers of billion cubic feet of gas
funds probably continued to liquidate bullish positions in the last two weeks of the year though there is no way to tell yet because publication of updated numbers has been delayed by the government shutdown
hedge fund accumulation of bullish positions likely accelerated and exaggerated the rise in gas prices early in the fourth quarter but it also enforced the necessary conservation of gas stocks and avoided worse shortages
as the seasonal gas deficit has been reduced and those bullish positions have unwound selling pressure has intensified the subsequent price plunge
