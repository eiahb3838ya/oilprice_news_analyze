the drive to eradicate a crime that has deprived state coffers of billions of dollars is president andres manuel lopez obrador s first major move against chronic corruption since taking office on but risks angering consumers and hurting the economy
criminal groups have been tapping pipelines and stealing tanker trucks laden with diesel and gasoline in the country for years reselling it illicitly often with apparent impunity
