israel says u.s. blocks its sale of fighter jets to croatia
zagreb reuters israel will not be able to deliver to croatia a dozen used fighter jets which croatia decided to buy last year to modernise its air force croatia s defence minister damir krsticevic said on thursday
israel has officially informed us that it can not get an approval from the united states for delivery of the planes to croatia krsticevic told reporters after a meeting with an israeli delegation in zagreb
officials from both sides said croatia held no responsibility for the deal falling through
they gave no comment on why the united states opposed the sale
croatian media reported the problem arose as the planes have been refitted with israeli technology depriving defence companies the chance to update and service the planes
the state department did not comment because it was on furlough
croatia s prime minister andrej plenkovic said earlier this week that zagreb would not accept any other deal but the original israeli offer which it accepted last march
the agreement on buying the planes has not been signed so there is no financial damage to our budget plenkovic told a cabinet session on thursday
he added that croatia was determined to continue with its plans of modernising its air force
it is unclear at the moment whether zagreb would now call another tender or turn to other bidders that competed in a previous tender
the deal with israel was supposed to be worth million
israel had been in competition with several countries bidding for zagreb s sweden s saab was reported as being the most serious competitor offering new gripen planes but at a much higher price
croatia joined the nato alliance in and the europeanunion in
its air force currently owns a squadron of outdated fighter jets but just three planes are operational at the moment
