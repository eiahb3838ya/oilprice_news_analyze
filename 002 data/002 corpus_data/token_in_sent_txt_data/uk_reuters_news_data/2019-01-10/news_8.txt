update 2-u.s. sanctions against nord stream 2 wrong solution -germany's maas
adds reaction from embassy in berlin berlin jan reuters sanctions against the nord stream pipeline would be the wrong way to solve a dispute over energy supply german foreign minister heiko maas said on thursday
president donald trump has accused germany of being a captive of russia due to its energy reliance and urged it to halt work on the billion gas pipeline that is to be built in the baltic sea
questions of european energy policy must be decided in europe not in the maas said
to impose unilateral sanctions against nord stream is certainly not the way to berlin and moscow have been at odds since russia annexed crimea four years ago
but they have a common interest in the nord stream project which is expected to double the capacity of the existing nord stream route
washington is concerned the pipeline which will bypass ukraine by running under the baltic sea will strip ukraine of important transit revenues
joseph spokesman for the embassy in berlin said other european states also opposed the planned pipeline
we would point out that the european parliament condemned nord stream and called for its cancellation as recently as december he said in response to the comments by maas
washington has touted liquefied natural gas delivered by companies as an alternative to russian gas
german economy minister peter altmaier told reuters in an interview last month that germany would build the infrastructure to import lng and that authorities were currently in the process of clarifying location issues with private investors
