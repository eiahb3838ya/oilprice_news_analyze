maduro faces next term in a hobbled, isolated venezuela
caracas jan reuters venezuelan president nicolas maduro begins a second term in office on thursday in defiance of international criticism that his reelection last year was illegitimate further isolating the south american country where an economic crisis is fueling a humanitarian emergency
leaders from the ruling socialist party have disavowed criticism of maduro s inauguration which will keep him at the helm of the opec oil exporter until calling for rallies of support and promoting him on social media with twitter hashtags such as iampresident
opposition leaders however have portrayed thursday s inauguration as the moment at which maduro will be internationally branded a dictator following a widely boycotted election that governments around the world described as a farce
but continued support from the military a chronically fractured opposition and a relentless crackdown on opposition critics means that maduro appears to face few serious challenges at home despite the international outcry
they ve tried to turn a constitutional ceremony into a world war maduro said during a press conference on wednesday afternoon
but whether there s rain thunder or lightning we re going to the ceremony is scheduled for local time gmt on thursday
maduro s triumphalism echoes that of his predecessor late socialist leader hugo chavez who used abundant oil revenues to flood venezuela with consumer goods while providing heavily subsidized food and medicine
that contrasts sharply with the venezuela of today
inflation is fast approaching million percent leaving a monthly minimum wage worth less than a carton of eggs
some three million people have emigrated since many on foot to escape rising malnutrition and disease according to the united nations
bank notes that once paid for months worth of groceries are now tossed in trash cans piled into useless stacks or even woven into women s handbags sold by street merchants
maduro last year won reelection despite the economic chaos in large part because the opposition boycotted the vote in which socialist party activists openly made payments to voters within a stone s throw of polling stations
countries around the world condemned the vote including the united states and venezuela s neighbors in latin america leaving maduro backed by just a handful of stalwart allies from leftist governments
while few countries plan to shutter embassies or sever ties with the maduro government according to diplomatic sources the vast majority will not send diplomats to the inauguration as is customary
the government feted the arrival of foreign dignitaries who traveled for the inauguration including the president of south ossetia a disputed territory in the caucasus region that is rarely described as nation
that sparked guffaws from opposition critics who called it a signal of isolation
opposition activists have called for protests on thursday
authorities have responded by filling streets with police checkpoints and troops
fury in over maduro s aggressive sidelining of the congress led to a wave of protests that killed over but failed to shake him from power and left his adversaries frustrated
they re trying to scare us so that we don t protest said henry ramirez a computer engineer in the western city of san cristobal attempting to cut into a line for gasoline the type of a queue that has become increasingly frequent amid the crisis
tomorrow the dictatorship while politically motivated demonstrations have faded protests take place nearly every day to demand salary improvements access to food and medicine or improvements to spotty power and water services
less than hours before maduro s swearing in troops in the second largest city of maracaibo fired tear gas at informal vendors who were defying an order not to set up stalls at a market in the city center
the vendors later looted nearby shops
maduro is going to be sworn in and i don t think it changes anything said angela perez who works the cash register at a restaurant in the city of valencia adding she does not sympathize with maduro or his critics
i m just trying to get a few more documents together so i can leave the country
there s no future here
