exclusive-vw, china spearhead $300 bln global drive to electrify cars
reuters global automakers are planning a billion surge in spending on electric vehicle technology over the next five to years with nearly half of the money targeted at china accelerating the industry s transition from fossil fuels and shifting power to asian battery and electric vehicle technology suppliers
the unprecedented level of spending much of it by germany s volkswagen ag is driven in large measure by government policies adopted to cut carbon dioxide emissions and will extend technological advances that have improved battery cost range and charging time to make electric vehicles more appealing to consumers according to an exclusive reuters analysis of public data released by those companies
china for decades played to german japanese and american automakers which dominated internal combustion vehicle technology
now china is positioned to lead electric vehicle development industry executives say
the future of volkswagen will be decided in the chinese market said herbert diess chief executive of vw which has joint ventures with two of china s largest automakers saic motor and faw car
speaking earlier this week to a small group of reporters in beijing diess said china will become one of the automotive powerhouses in the what we find in china is really the right environment to develop the next generation of cars and we find the right skills which we only partially have in europe or other places he said
diess added we have very clear policies established here in china
policymakers and regulators are requiring a shift to electric vehicles
as china and other countries place more restrictions on conventional gasoline and diesel engines auto companies have accelerated the shift to electrification
a year ago global automakers said they planned to spend billion on electric vehicle development
the billion that automakers have earmarked to put electric vehicles into mass production in china europe and north america is greater than the economies of egypt or chile
almost of the industry s ev spending total about billion is being committed by the volkswagen group which is aggressively trying to distance itself from the dieselgate scandal which has cost it billions in penalties and legal settlements
vw s sweeping electrification plan envisions capacity on three continents to build up to million electric vehicles by including pure electric and hybrid electric models
eventually vw plans to offer electrified versions of all models in its global portfolio which includes audi and porsche
vw s staggering ev budget dwarfs that of its closest competitor germany s daimler ag which has committed billion
in comparison general motors co the no automaker has said it plans to spend a combined billion on electric and vehicles
roughly percent of the global industry s planned ev investment and procurement spending more than billion will occur in china which is heavily promoting the production and sale of electric vehicles through a system of quotas credits and incentives
as a result ev spending by major chinese automakers from saic to great wall motor could be matched or even exceeded by multinational partners such vw daimler and gm as they dramatically expand their electric vehicle portfolios in china and ramp up battery purchases from chinese suppliers
reuters analysed investment and procurement budgets made public over the past two years by of the world s top automakers based primarily in the united states china japan korea india germany and france
the figures do not reflect planned investments and purchases that have not yet been made public
actual spending by vehicle manufacturers on research and development engineering production tooling and procurement likely will be much higher
the analysis also does not include related spending by automotive suppliers technology companies and large corporations in other industries from energy and aerospace to electronics and telecommunications
there has been a rush to invest in electric vehicles and batteries said alexandre marian alixpartners managing director and of a study that forecast total ev spending of billion through by global automakers and suppliers
marian said the industry has increased spending budgets on electric vehicles and batteries while seeking more alliances and partnerships to help spread the higher investment costs
alliances such as those between vw and its chinese partners will be among the greatest spurs to innovation especially in the global rollout of electric vehicles
ceo diess said vw is evolving from the model where we have been developing and bringing european technology into this market to a new phase where we will part of the automotive technology in china for the rest of the world
