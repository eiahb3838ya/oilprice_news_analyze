just left a meeting with chuck and nancy a total waste of time trump wrote on twitter
i asked what is going to happen in days if i quickly open things up are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier trump wrote
nancy said no
i said nothing else works exasperated democrats called trump s behaviour a temper tantrum and said the meeting broke down when they refused to commit to funding his proposed southern border wall
trump s desire for a wall between the united states and mexico was a central theme of his presidential campaign
it was a petulant president of the united states pelosi told reporters when she returned to the capitol
a person who would say i ll keep government shut down for weeks months or years unless i get my that s just not the way democracy works and so it s very schumer said trump had a temper the lawmaker told reporters that is sad and unfortunate
we want to come to an agreement
we believe in border security
we have different the breakdown in talks could strengthen the possibility that trump will declare a national emergency to build a wall on the southern border if no deal with congress can be reached on his request for billion billion pounds for the project
earlier on wednesday trump said he had the authority to declare a national emergency that would let him pay for the wall with military funds
vice president mike pence told reporters trump was still considering that option
asked what trump had gained by walking out pence said i think the president made his position very clear today that there will be no deal without a shortly after the white house meeting broke up the house of representatives passed legislation to end a partial shutdown of the treasury department and some other agencies that have been closed since without money for the wall
but there was no indication that the senate controlled by trump s fellow republicans would allow a vote on the bill
democrats are eager to force republicans to choose between funding the treasury s internal revenue service at a time when it should be gearing up to issue tax refunds to millions of americans and voting to keep it partially shuttered

i think we re going to be here a pelosi plans more votes this week that one by one would provide money to operate departments ranging from homeland security and justice to state agriculture commerce and labour
able to get the bills through the house because of the democratic majority pelosi is hoping some senate republicans back her up and abandon trump s wall gambit

other essential employees are being required to report to work but without pay for the time being
on thursday trump travels to the border to highlight what he calls an immigration he delivered his first television address from the oval office on tuesday to make his case for the border wall
the funding fight stems from congress inability to complete work by a deadline last september on funding all government agencies
it did however appropriate money for about percent of the government on time mainly military and programs
