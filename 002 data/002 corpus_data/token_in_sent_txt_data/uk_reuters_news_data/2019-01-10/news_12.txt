mexicans embrace bikes, scooters as fuel shortage drags on
mexico city reuters mexicans faced with a fuel shortage are turning to bikes and scooters generating business for startups that rent those alternative rides but straining operations for service uber in some cities
the shortages came after mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador closed some vulnerable pipelines in a crackdown on fuel theft
there have been long lines at pumping stations this week in several states
uber said the fuel shortage posed challenges in some cities in the central state of guanajuato and the western state of michoacan
users are requesting fewer trips in those cities but with fewer uber drivers on the road demand has increased for those who are working said company spokesman saul crespo
although the temporary closure of some gas stations can affect the demand for available vehicles we are working to make sure our driving partners do not see their profits affected crespo said in a statement adding uber will take steps to hold prices steady
spanish company cabify said its operations had also been affected while chinese firm didi chuxing said it had not been impacted
for startups peddling bikes and scooters the crisis touched off a flurry of new business
mobility as a service for latin america a trade group representing firms such as chinese company mobike and california scooter outfit bird reported a spike in demand as people who normally drive scramble for alternatives
it s a big opportunity for those companies to show that new alternatives can be substitutes for traditional cars for short distances said miguel abad who leads public affairs for the group
mobike which entered mexico with its fleet of bright orange bikes last year said its trips jumped an additional percent above normal growth over the past few days
jetty a mexico service has seen a percent rise in demand and expects the trend to intensify in the coming days said chief executive cristina palacios
