start date for new permian oil line in jeopardy on regulatory delay
new york jan reuters epic crude pipeline lp said the projected of its crude pipeline from the permian basin to corpus christi texas is in some jeopardy after regulators delayed action on its petition to set initial tariff rates
the san antonio texas based company said in a letter to federal energy regulatory commission dated that the requested action date for ferc to pass a declaratory order that would allow epic to set rates has now come and gone causing concern to shippers
the planned bpd pipeline stretching from southeast new mexico and west texas to refineries and other destinations in and around corpus christi is one of the largest lines currently under construction and is seen as vital for bringing crude out of the largest oilpatch in the united states
crude prices in the permian basin have come under pressure in recent months as a production surge has overwhelmed existing pipeline and infrastructure sparking a race to add new lines
prices in texas collapsed in due to full lines
currently the permian produces about million bpd accounting for about a third of overall production of million bpd according to energy department figures
the pipeline was projected to be up and running to corpus christi by the third quarter

we have had no indication from commission staff that any aspect of our project is problematic from a regulatory standpoint but we are committed to addressing and resolving any issues that should arise in that regard epic said in its letter urging ferc to vote on the petition by
epic currently has committed transportation agreements with five shippers covering about percent of the system s capacity it said in the letter
the case is still under review a ferc spokeswoman said
epic was formed in and the crude line is one of its first projects
in october epic said it would convert a portion of its planned natural gas liquids pipeline to transport crude instead
