update 1-brazil denies total license to drill amazon basin for fourth time
sao paulo reuters brazilian environmental agency ibama on tuesday rejected french oil company total sa s application for an environmental license to drill in the ecologically sensitive foz do amazonas basin
it is the fourth time that ibama has rejected the application and requested additional information
ibama said when denying the application for a third time in august that it would give total one last chance to clarify the application before suspending the process
on tuesday however it said it would seek more information as new facts had come to light
total sa did not immediately respond to request for comment
an expedition last month by environmental activists greenpeace documented coral in the area where total plans to drill following the earlier discovery of a massive coral reef nearby
the agency s refusals to accept total s environmental impact study has held up the company s quest to explore the offshore basin for more than four years
the basin could contain up to billion barrels of petroleum or more than the entire proven reserves in the gulf of mexico according to geologists
