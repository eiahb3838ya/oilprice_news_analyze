update 3-libyan factions agree to dec. 10 elections at paris talks
paris reuters rival libyan factions agreed on tuesday on a declaration that would create a political framework to pave the way for elections in december to end the country s conflict
the nation splintered following the revolt that toppled muammar gaddafi and since has been divided between competing political and military groups based in tripoli and the east
the united nations is leading an effort to reunify libya and to organise national elections
france under president emmanuel macron has sought to play a bigger role in coaxing the factions to end the turmoil which has let islamist militants gain a foothold and migrant smugglers flourish
the paris meeting included commander khalifa haftar tripoli prime minister fayez seraj and the leaders of rival parliamentary assemblies aimed to urge them to agree general principles for ending the conflict and moving towards elections
the four stakeholders said they had agreed on a document to work constructively with the to realise credible and peaceful elections by and abide by the results
nobody says it will be a path layered with roses
the challenges exist and will continue to grow seraj told a news conference
last month there was a terrorist attack and there are a certain number of enemies to this democratic the declaration was not signed as originally planned because the parties do not all recognise each other s legitimacy and want to consult their home base but they agreed in principle
the document includes a call for the immediate unification of the central bank and the phasing out of parallel government and institutions
it makes a commitment to support the creation of a national army and encourage a dialogue on the issue in cairo
the parties committed to set the constitutional basis for elections and to adopt electoral laws by with a view to holding legislative and presidential elections on
libya envoy ghassan salame said he would have his work cut out in the coming weeks but that he saw a convergence between the will of the libyan people and the international community
this convergence must not be lost he said
the declaration also agrees to an inclusive political national conference without setting a timeframe
unlike an earlier draft it no longer directly threatens international sanctions on those who impede the accord or dispute the outcome of elections
claudia gazzini senior libya analyst for the international crisis group said the statement was more nuanced than earlier drafts but set an extremely optimistic timeframe for elections and left unclear how the powers of a future president would be decided
past attempts at peace deals in libya have often been scuttled by internal divisions among the country s armed groups and by the different countries backing the local actors
to tackle that countries and organisations were represented including italy turkey united arab emirates qatar and libya s neighbours who all have influence over different groups on the ground
by accepting these dates and a protocol nobody will be able to say they don t agree because all the protagonists were here today macron said at the news conference
