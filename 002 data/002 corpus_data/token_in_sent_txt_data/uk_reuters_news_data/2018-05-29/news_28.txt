british regulator lays out scope of sse/npower merger inquiry
london reuters britain s competition regulator on tuesday set out more detail about what it intends to examine in its investigation of the between the retail power units of energy companies sse and innogy s npower
the competition and markets authority cma said earlier this month it had launched investigation into the between the companies saying it may reduce competition and increase prices for some households
on tuesday the cma said it would consider the impact of the merger on the supply of gas and electricity to customers in britain
the cma will also consider any implications arising from plans for a larger asset swap between innogy s parent company rwe and which also has a british retail energy business
the cma will also look at the potential impact on british independent energy supplier utility warehouse which has around customers and relies on npower for is gas and electricity supplies
this theory of harm considers whether the merged entity would have an incentive to raise svt standard variable tariff prices to increase its wholesale prices to utility warehouse the cma said
the merger would create britain s retail power provider and reduce the big six dominating the market to five companies when they are already facing political scrutiny for high prices
the cma is expected to issue a final report by oct
