el al airlines first-quarter loss widens as market share falls
jerusalem reuters el al israel airlines on tuesday reported a bigger loss in the first quarter reflecting the impact of higher jet fuel and salary costs and a further deterioration in market share
israel s flag carrier has met with stiff competition from rivals including turkish airlines aeroflot easyjet and wizzair which offer lower fares on routes to israel even though some flights require a stopover
during the quarter el al s market share at tel aviv s airport slipped to percent from percent a year earlier but the airline remained the market leader
el al s passenger numbers rose percent versus percent for all airlines according to data from the israel airports authority
el al said its passenger load factor which measures capacity utilization was percent compared with percent last year
chief executive gonen usishkin said the results reflected the many challenges stemming from the open skies with europe and the fierce and increasing competition from foreign airlines especially low cost he said due to the increasing competition el al would accelerate its efficiency plan including removing older boeing aircraft from service this year rather than in and changing its commission payments to travel agents
it is also postponing the launch of a route to san francisco until the second quarter of from later this year
the plan examines all channels of operation and areas of activity and aims to increase revenue and significantly reduce expenses to create a clear path of an improvement of results over many years usishkin said
the company reported a million loss in the first three months of compared with a million loss a year earlier partly weighed down by a weaker dollar against the shekel
revenue rose percent to million although expenses rose percent largely because of a percent increase in jet fuel costs and higher salary expenses as the minimum wage increased
el al is banking on a more than billon overhaul of its fleet to win back customers while also revamping its fare structure
it has received the first four of boeing aircraft that will be delivered by and it expects three more by the end of october
in march el al petitioned israel s supreme court to restrict any new flights to the country via saudi airspace until it can also use a shorter route
saudi arabia does not recognize israel and el al must take a more circuitous route to avoid saudi arabia which it has said adds two hours to flight times and increases costs
the petition came a week after saudi arabia opened its airspace for the first time to a commercial flight to israel
