bcp said following the decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal that the bank complied with all sanctions in force and conducts its business accordingly
earlier this month germany s lender dz bank said it would halt financial transactions with iran in july
finance and trade sources say iran faces increasing difficulties accessing capital
transactions had already been constrained as many large foreign banks remained wary of trade even under the nuclear deal
the exodus by the limited number of foreign banks willing to process transactions with iran is a big blow especially on the trade finance side one finance source said
the nuclear agreement worked out by the united states five other world powers and iran lifted sanctions on tehran in exchange for limits to its nuclear programme
tehran is pressuring europe to come up with a package of economic measures by may after major powers agreed on friday to move quickly to offset washington s withdrawal from the deal
those measures include banning firms from complying with the reimposed sanctions urging governments to make transfers to iran s central bank to avoid fines and creating alternative financing channels
but analysts say there are big challenges to keeping the nuclear deal alive
the sanctions will make iran s business environment more difficult to operate in bmi research said in a note last week
firms that have exposure to the market are therefore unlikely to want to maintain or expand their iranian presence for fear of sanction related penalties and backlash in the editing by adrian croft and mark potter
