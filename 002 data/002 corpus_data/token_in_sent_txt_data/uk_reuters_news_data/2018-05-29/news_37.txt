update 1-aluminium producers seek up to 24 pct higher q3 premiums from japan buyers -sources
producers offer premiums of vs in the offer if accepted will mark the highest in over years offers reflect firmer premiums amid sanction on rusal adds comments and details by yuka obayashi tokyo may reuters two global aluminium producers have offered japanese buyers a premium of per tonne for primary metal shipments for the quarter up percent from the current quarter four sources directly involved in pricing talks said
japan is asia s biggest aluminium importer and the premiums for primary metal shipments it agrees to pay each quarter over the london metal exchange lme cash price set the benchmark for the region
the premium if accepted would be the highest in over three years and the third straight quarterly rise reflecting premiums in the united states that have surged amid the country s tariffs on aluminium imports and sanctions on rusal the world s producer of the metal
we have received an offer at per tonne from one producer and at from another supplier late on monday a source at a trading house said on tuesday
the producers claimed firmer spot premiums and tighter supplies due to sanction on rusal as the reasons for their stronger offers but we are not feeling physical tightness in asia at least for now another source at a fabricator said
for the quarter ending june japanese buyers agreed to pay a premium of up percent from the prior quarter to reflect the spike in spot premiums
spot premiums in the united states have more than doubled so far this year underpinned by a percent tariff on aluminium imports to counter what president donald trump has described as unfair international competition
the united states move in april to impose sanctions on rusal preventing customers with exposure from continuing to buy metal from the company fanned further supply worries and drove up benchmark london prices to their highest in almost seven years
but rusal resumed shipping aluminium to some customers earlier this month following an extension of the deadline for companies to wind down contracts under the sanctions sources told reuters last week
given the uncertainty about global metal supply all the sources said they expect more difficult negotiations than usual between japanese buyers and producers
the latest quarterly pricing negotiations began this week between japanese buyers and smelters including rio tinto ltd rusal ltd and alcoa corp and are expected to continue through next month
