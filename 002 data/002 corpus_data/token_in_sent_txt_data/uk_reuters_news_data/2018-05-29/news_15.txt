brazil and petrobras ask court to declare planned oil worker strike illegal
sao paulo may reuters brazil s solicitor general s office and oil firm petroleo brasileiro sa said in a joint statement on tuesday that they were asking the country s top labor court for an injunction to halt a planned oil workers strike
unions representing oil workers say they will start a strike on wednesday
that would wreak further havoc on latin america s largest economy already paralyzed by a nationwide truckers strike against an increase in diesel prices
in a written statement the solicitor general s office said the planned oil workers strike was political and not as workers were demanding the resignation of petrobras chief executive officer pedro parente
