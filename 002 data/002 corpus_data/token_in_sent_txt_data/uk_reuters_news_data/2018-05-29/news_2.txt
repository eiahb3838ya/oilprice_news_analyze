update 5-canada to buy kinder morgan oil pipeline in bid to save project
reuters canada will buy kinder morgan canada ltd s trans mountain pipeline for c billion billion the government said on tuesday hoping to save a project that faces formidable political and environmental opposition
finance minister bill morneau said purchasing the pipeline was the only way to ensure that a planned expansion could proceed
the pipeline running from the oil sands of alberta to a port in the pacific province of british columbia would allow canadian crude to gain greater access to foreign markets and higher prices
kinder morgan canada gave ottawa until may to come up with reassurances it could press ahead with plans to more than double the capacity of the existing pipeline amid efforts by british columbia to block construction
the company also faced opposition from environmentalists and aboriginal groups who worried about the pipeline spilling its heavy oil
when we are faced with an exceptional situation that puts jobs at risk that puts our international reputation on the line our government is prepared to take action morneau told reporters
he said the pipeline purchase provided the federal jurisdiction needed to overcome british columbia s opposition but gave no details of how this would work
the federal government can in theory step in and disallow any provincial laws that british columbia might use to block the pipeline but this provision in the canadian constitution has not been used since the
ottawa could also deploy the police and troops to maintain a barrier between protesters and construction workers
although ottawa has taken stakes in struggling energy projects tuesday s announcement marked the first time ottawa has bought an entire pipeline
it does not intend to own the project for long
there is a very strong business case for this pipeline prime minister justin trudeau told bloomberg television saying the government takeover meant a lot of the legal barriers and a lot of the challenge points actually disappear
kinder morgan canada shares initially jumped as much as percent before ending down percent while the broader canada share index fell percent
the move drew immediate criticism from both sides of the political spectrum and could hurt trudeau s popularity in the key british columbia battleground in a federal election
the decision represents a massive unnecessary financial burden on canadian taxpayers canadian taxpayers federation federal director aaron wudrick said
the government will also offer federal loan guarantees to ensure construction of the expansion continues through the season as part of the deal with the company a unit of kinder morgan inc
morneau sidestepped questions about how ottawa will deal with opposition from environmentalists and aboriginal groups who cite the risk of a catastrophic spill
it s a mess out there said a calgary industry source not authorized to speak publicly
given it will be stuck in court for a while i don t think we will see this pipe built anytime morneau said more spending would be needed to complete the expansion but gave no precise financial details and stressed he felt the project should be returned to the private sector
canada s oil sector has been stung in the past year as foreign energy companies retreated amid concerns about the environmental toll high production costs and a risky regulatory regime
we have agreed to a fair price for our shareholders said steve kean chief executive officer of kinder morgan canada and kinder morgan kean did not say why he decided to sell rather than absorb the risk of further delays
kinder morgan canada will continue to own the remaining assets including crude storage rail terminals and a condensate pipeline and look to expand
i think the transaction is a
it s actually better for kinder morgan than it is for canada
they are getting a very good value said paul bloom at bloom investment counsel inc which owns about shares in kinder morgan canada
the fact the federal government needed to buy trans mountain to ensure the project goes ahead does not bode well for the industry said chris bloomer ceo of the canadian energy pipeline association
trans mountain stirred an unusual public fight between neighboring provinces
alberta threatened to halt crude and fuel shipments to british columbia where consumers already pay high gasoline prices and briefly halted imports of the coastal province s wines
alberta will contribute up to c billion toward unforeseen costs payable once the project is complete premier rachel notley said
the contribution will convert into equity in the pipeline
british columbia premier john horgan said the province would push ahead with a court case to establish its right to restrict increased shipments of crude oil to its coastal waters
