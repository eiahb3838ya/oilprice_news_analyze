brazil, petrobras near rights-transfer deal -deputy minister
rio de janeiro reuters petroleo brasileiro sa and brazil s government are very close to resolving a dispute over an offshore area a deputy minister said dismissing concerns a fuel pricing crisis had emerged as an obstacle in talks
on sunday brazilian president michel temer offered new fuel subsidies to soften the blow from a in diesel prices that has sparked a nationwide truckers protest paralyzing the country s economy
his government also promised to compensate petrobras for losses it may incur by abandoning a pricing policy
the offers of the subsidies fanned fears among investors that the turmoil could delay petrobras bid to conclude a longstanding compensation dispute with the government over the area dimming hopes for a windfall for the world s most indebted oil company
despite overlapping with the truckers strike talks were not suspended deputy mining and energy minister marcio felix told reuters late on monday
there are just a few sticking points
they are very earlier this month a brazilian paper reported that petrobras was likely to get the rights to produce an additional billion to billion barrels of oil to settle the dispute
resolving the dispute would let the government which is expected to be ousted in elections in october raise extra revenue to close a huge budget gap by auctioning off the rights to billions of barrels of oil
following a resolution of the dispute felix said such an auction could still be possible in november before the current government turns over power to a new president in january
he emphasized that the goal was shared by petrobras ceo pedro parente who has been rumored to be considering resigning from the company he is credited with turning around after a massive corruption scandal and years of mismanagement
rights would be a crowning achievement for him after two years in management felix said adding that it would not be good for him to leave the dispute has its roots in a deal under which brazil s government granted petrobras rights to extract billion barrels of oil and gas from under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor for a price based on oil prices then
however the contract stipulated that costs among other things would be reviewed after the area was declared commercially viable in
that has led to years of sparring as oil prices have fluctuated
oil executives say a bid round for the remaining areas would draw enormous bids thanks to top notch geology and lack of risk
