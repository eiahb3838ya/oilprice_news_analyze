trump giving japan's abe a hard time on trade despite close ties
tokyo reuters tariffs on steel threats of car import levies and intense pressure for a economic deal despite warm personal ties president donald trump is giving japanese prime minister shinzo abe a decidedly tough time on trade
trump has also withdrawn from a multilateral partnership tpp promoted by abe as a counterweight to china abandoned a climate change accord backed by tokyo and is pursuing talks with north korean leader kim jong un notwithstanding abe s warnings about past mistakes
since trump was elected the two leaders have met nine times shared burgers played golf three times and spoken nearly times by phone
in their latest telephone chat overnight abe and trump agreed to meet again before a korea summit that could take place next month
i think he has penetrated trump s mind to a certain degree but that is different from his pet agenda on trade said keio university professor toshihiro nakayama
prime minister abe and his team expected a bit more because of the personal chemistry
that was a bit of wishful thinking look at macron nakayama added
like abe french president emmanuel macron has developed a strong personal relationship with trump yet has clashed with him over issues including iran climate change and trade
trump s administration decided last week to begin a national security investigation into auto imports that could lead to new tariffs similar to those already imposed on imported steel and aluminum
motor vehicles make up about percent of japanese exports to the united states
the auto probe follows an april agreement by trump and abe to set up a new framework to discuss free fair and reciprocal trade that will be led by trade representative robert lighthizer and japanese economy minister toshimitsu motegi
trump has made clear he prefers a bilateral deal to cut a trade deficit with japan that hit billion yen billion last month
however abe s administration insists multilateral pacts are still the best bet
ffr is not a negotiation or scoping exercise for a bilateral fta free trade agreement a japanese official speaking on condition of anonymity told reuters
we see it in a broader behind japan s resistance to a bilateral fta is in part the fear of pressure to open up its agriculture sector
the farm lobby is an important base for abe s ruling party
for now japan is working from a familiar playbook with a strategy combining highlighting past and planned purchases of goods and investments possible moves sanctioned by the world trade organization wto and expanding a web of trade pacts that tokyo hopes will eventually lure washington back to the multilateral order
japan has notified the wto it reserves the right to take against the tariffs on steel and aluminum totaling million the amount of added duties the tariffs would impose on its exports of those products
we have the right but not the obligation to do it the japanese official said adding any steps against future tariffs on japanese car exports would also be
as they ve done since trump was elected japanese officials are highlighting how much japanese carmakers and other firms contribute to the economy
as of japan says its companies have invested a cumulative billion in the united state creating more than jobs
a rise in energy imports is also expected to help trim the bilateral trade imbalance
japan received its first shipment of liquefied natural gas lng last week from dominion energy inc s newly completed cove point maryland export plant the beginning of a jump in imports from the united states
the balance will tilt toward the united states
whether it is big enough is open to question but at least things will be happening in the eyes of the president the japanese official said
japanese officials deny they are on trade negotiations but some experts said playing for time could be useful
it s not japan that needs a bilateral fta
it s the united states said former japanese trade negotiator yorizumi watanabe
japan can take the approach of that tactic however risks backfiring
the president is as you know a man of action and expects us to get results quickly ambassador to japan william hagerty said earlier this month
i think abe understands reporting by linda sieg
