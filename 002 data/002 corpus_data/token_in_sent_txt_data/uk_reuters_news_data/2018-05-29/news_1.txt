rpt-how the world's biggest private equity oil and gas industry bid collapsed
repeats story first published on tuesday no change to text harbour energy pursued santos for a year raising bid times discussions cordial but santos unyielding on seeking big premium santos balked at hedging requirements for deal by sonali paul melbourne may reuters blame it on trump iran or venezuela
rising oil prices combined with a heavy debt load killed the world s biggest private equity oil and gas industry deal last week
harbour energy left australia after a year of chasing gas producer santos ltd missing out on santos stakes in three liquefied natural gas projects in australia and papua new guinea as it sought to become a major lng player
the firm backed by eig global energy partners was forced to bid against itself five times including twice over one weekend until it made a final offer of billion up more than percent from its first approach last august
the grievance runs deep and it s heartfelt said a person in the harbour camp
harbour chief executive linda cook a former senior executive at royal dutch shell was on a plane last tuesday when she heard santos had rejected its sixth offer worth about a a share
she declined to comment for this story
harbour s disappointed chairman blair thomas was already back in washington dc and didn t mince words
there was insufficient engagement with santos on valuation no meaningful attempt by santos to discuss a realistic price which could supported by any reasonable set of technical and commercial assumptions and an unwillingness by their board to explore means of closing the gap between the offer and their expectations he said in a statement
thomas believed by the end of a weekend of back and forth between advisers on both sides that he had a deal with santos chairman keith spence a person in the harbour camp said
harbour s team were parked in sydney where harbour s backer eig has an office and advisers at jpmorgan morgan stanley and highbury are based according to people involved
a couple of hundred people were involved in analysing data and conducting due diligence they said
cook and thomas met kevin gallagher and keith spence their counterparts at santos on may
they felt encouraged the board would facilitate an offer going to shareholders people in the harbour camp said
people on both sides said talks were cordial the whole time but the santos board was firm on value and harbour failed to offer enough of a premium as oil prices marched higher
crude prices climbed from around a barrel when harbour made its first approach in august to last week their highest since late as president donald trump imposed sanctions on venezuela and pulled out of a nuclear arms control deal with iran both key oil producers
what hurt harbour was the billion in debt they had lined up from jpmorgan and morgan stanley which required oil price hedging against percent of santos lng sales making the deal complex santos investors and bankers said
the problem is when you get deals there are a lot of terms and conditions you have to meet and it makes it inflexible said a veteran australian investment banker not involved in the bid
santos balked when harbour tried to force the company to lock in the hedges in order to cut costs for the banks and allow harbour to raise its offer
santos said it was resilient to the oil price fall as it has slashed costs to be cash flow breakeven at a barrel
the value of the harbour bid was simply not compelling enough compared with santos own growth plan the risks associated with the hedging and the reliance on santos balance sheet to help fund the deal a santos spokeswoman said
not only was harbour jilted at the altar but the biggest shareholders in santos chinese gas distributor enn ecological and private equity firm hony capital missed out on more than doubling their combined stake to up to percent in a privatised santos
sources said enn and hony were as furious as harbour
they re deeply disappointed and angry and frustrated a person close to enn said
they feel that the outcome didn t reflect some of the conversations with senior santos however in a statement to the shanghai stock exchange last week enn which has a director on the board of santos said the company s future cooperation with santos is not a santos spokeswoman said enn is part of a united santos board and the company s strategic relationship with enn and hony remains in place
hony said it will closely follow the further development
swiss energy and commodities trader mercuria which was set to contribute percent of the bid was thwarted in its ambition to use santos to get into lng trading where its rivals glencore gunvor trafigura and vitol are already active
a lot of time and money went into this so it is annoying said a person familiar with mercuria s thinking
mecuria declined to comment
harbour s first approach last august was swiftly rejected by the board under peter coates who had also rebuffed a billion takeover offer two years earlier when santos was wallowing in debt as oil prices collapsed
the august approach was only disclosed by santos in november after a newspaper outed harbour
it took harbour until march to line up funding from jpmorgan and morgan stanley and equity from mercuria enn and hony in order to make another approach
top shareholder argo investments said the deal was too complex and would have involved santos taking on too much risk when there was a lot of uncertainty around whether it would be approved
shareholders have faith in ceo gallagher who slashed costs and cut debt faster than expected over the past two years
it s fair to say that he s done a pretty good job said argo investments managing director jason beddow
the proof will be in the pudding as to how santos looks in a year or two s time which is somewhat dependent on the oil reporting by sonali paul
