london's muslims take a green bite out of ramadan
london may thomson reuters foundation sitting in straight rows on the floor supping on bowls of soup made from foraged nettles and vegetable stew a group of london muslims are breaking with ramadan tradition
the evening meal known as iftar breaks the fast during the muslim holy month of ramadan and is often associated with excess with tables groaning under the weight of heavy meat dishes
here though the emphasis is on seasonal food no meat and no dairy while plastic forks and straws and disposable plates are nowhere to be seen
this ethical iftar is about looking particularly at key issues around meat consumption during ramadan food waste during ramadan and plastic waste we wanted to do an iftar plan that had none of those things said organiser jumana moon
it s about trying to reconnect our responsibility to nature as part of our worship not a separate hobby or interest she told the thomson reuters foundation
participants in the event at rumi s cave a london venue that hosts courses for millennial muslims and nights had to bring their own cutlery and crockery as well as containers for leftovers
wherever possible the food was locally sourced including the nettles used to make the classic british soup which grow in the wild and the vegetables
there were readings from the quran that focused on the importance of caring for the environment while the seeds from the dates that are traditionally used to break the fast were collected for replanting or composting
participant sohaib elnahla said the green iftar underscored the importance in islam of eating food that was sustainable and wholesome
if mosques all did a green iftar it would have a massive impact on the practices said elnahla a prayer leader and teacher
john parry a christian minister who attended the iftar event said it offered a vital message for people of all faiths
we have thought of ourselves as human beings that can do what we want with creation when in fact we re given responsibilities to look after creation and not to abuse it he said
it s a message that is absolutely vital in this day and piles of food and plastic plates often spill out of bins at the end of iftar meals said moon who organised the event with the rabbani project a creative collective who hoped the event would also raise awareness about limiting food waste
traditional practices such as eating from shared plates or with hands to using clay cups and wooden spoons could all be revived she said
