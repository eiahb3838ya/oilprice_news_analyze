update 2-sandridge fights back against icahn over board control
reuters sandridge energy inc warned shareholders on tuesday they would be handing control of the company too cheaply to activist investor carl icahn if they elect his new nominees to the board at an annual meeting next month
icahn earlier in may added two more nominees to his slate demanding yet more influence after the company expanded its board to seven directors from five to accommodate the activist investor s demands
in a letter to shareholders sandridge chief executive officer william griffin said the billionaire investor who has said he could make an offer for the company was not competing fairly with other potential counterparties
an board would likely have a chilling effect on the participation of potential counterparties because such a process would be rigged in favor of icahn griffin said
icahn has made a career out of shaking up company management and as the biggest shareholder in sandridge with a percent stake he has already forced the resignation of both its chief executive and chief financial officers
sandridge s shares however have fallen more than percent since icahn disclosed his stake on and the jury is still out on how new management or sales of company assets would deliver more value to shareholders
a slump in oil prices and its exposure to costly production in the mississippi lime forced the oklahoma oil producer briefly into bankruptcy proceedings in
oil prices have since recovered to a barrel for the first time since and shale producers in the united states have benefited from cheaper drilling methods and ever increasing global demand
the question is whether sandridge now has a better spread of drilling sites to take advantage of the rise
david beard analyst at coker palmer institutional said while investors often penalize the valuations of companies with current declining production icahn is betting on sandridge s undrilled locations in the hope that those will bring the production levels up
sd operates in a relatively higher cost mississippi lime basin thus the downturn hurt them particularly hard having to drop almost all their rigs
this placed downward pressure on production beard said
but should production grow and undrilled locations become valuable we can see net asset values approach icahn initially persuaded sandridge s leadership to back out of a million deal with rival bonanza creek energy inc but he has now spent months laying into its management
in april the billionaire nominated jonathan frates and nicholas graziano both of whom work for icahn companies to sandridge s board
the other three nominees are john lipinski and bob alexander who have worked with refining company cvr energy inc and randolph read who has worked with investment fund nevada strategic credit investment
ahead of the june shareholders meeting griffin said icahn s continuous additions to the board would end the impartial process drive away competition and position icahn to consolidate control as cheaply as possible
icahn s involvement and pressuring of newell brands inc to appoint four of his nominees to its board ran parallel to the company s shares recovering some of last year s almost percent loss
they have since retreated to back to near record lows
icahn s move with fellow shareholder darwin deason to prevent xerox corp merging with fujifilm holdings have seen shares in the photocopying icon fall around percent from a high hit when the deal was announced in january
icahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment
