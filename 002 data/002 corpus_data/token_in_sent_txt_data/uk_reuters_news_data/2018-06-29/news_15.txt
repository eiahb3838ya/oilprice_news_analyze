update 1-congo says it will open two national parks up to oil drilling
kinshasa reuters democratic republic of congo s government said on friday that it has decided to open up parts of virunga and salonga national parks home to mountain gorillas bonobos and other rare species to oil drilling
earlier proposals to allow oil exploration in the parks met fierce resistance from environmental activists who say drilling would place wildlife at risk and release huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere causing global warming
the government has defended its right to authorize drilling anywhere in the country and said it is mindful of protecting animals and plants in the two unesco world heritage sites
the cabinet said in a statement that it had approved the establishment of interministerial commissions charged with preparing plans to declassify sections of the parks including sq km or percent of eastern congo s virunga
virunga sits on the volcanoes of central africa and is home to over half the global population of mountain gorillas
british company soco international performed seismic testing there but let its license lapse in
salonga covers sq km of the congo basin the world s rainforest and contains bonobos forest elephants dwarf chimpanzees and congo peacocks
