japan refiners boost u.s. crude purchases as iran sanctions loom
tokyo reuters japanese refiners are ramping up purchases of crude as it becomes cheaper relative to their usual middle east supplies and are assessing heavy grades from shale production as a replacement for supplies from iran industry sources said
increasing purchases by refiners such as jxtg japan s biggest are likely to please president donald trump who is pushing japan to reduce its trade surplus with the united states which topped billion in
nearly million barrels of crude are due to arrive in japan the world s fourth biggest oil importer between june and september according to the sources and thomson reuters eikon shipping data
they will add to about million barrels worth billion yen million imported in the year through may according to the latest statistics from the country s ministry of finance
japan s imports of oil are still tiny compared with total imports of around million barrels a day in
refiners tend to buy only when lower demand from events such as refinery maintenance drives down oil prices
japan imported an high of million barrels of crude in but imports slowed sharply in the first five months of this year as spot crude prices were stronger than middle east benchmark dubai
a steep rise in output has since widened the price gap between the two benchmarks to more than a barrel making oil more attractive
at least one japanese refiner has been assessing mars crude as a potential replacement for iranian crude as the company plans to cut iran loadings after september as sanctions are reinstated said a source with knowledge of the matter
because of sanctions on iranian crude we are looking at heavy crude as a substitute the source said in particular grades such as southern green canyon and mars which are similar to crude from iran
jxtg holdings recently bought million barrels of west texas intermediate crude for arrival by september according to three industry sources
a jxtg spokesman would not comment on individual deals but said
crude is one of the candidates for replacing iran cosmo energy holdings is also lifting million barrels of oil between april and july according to shipping data and a source familiar with the matter
cosmo declined to comment but said it buys crude from time to time
japan crude imports from on the rise trump in may withdrew the united states from a agreement that curbed tehran s nuclear capabilities and ordered the reimposition of sanctions against tehran
on tuesday a senior state department official said the united states wants to stop all exports of iranian oil from november and is unlikely to offer any exemptions as it did during previous sanctions
japan s prime minister shinzo abe has also been trying to fend off demands from the president to sign a bilateral trade agreement by offering to buy more american products
prime minister abe will probably try to accommodate president trump as much as possible on the trade imbalance and buying crude oil is a as long as the economics work from tony nunan senior oil risk manager at mitsubishi corp in tokyo
to replace iranian oil it makes sense to go for a sour grade such as mars and green canyon
the problem is these grades are also needed in the and it is the very light sweet grades that are in excess nunan said
this meant supplies of the heavier grades would likely only be available when demand dropped during refinery maintenance periods for example
japan ramped up purchases of iranian crude after the end of sanctions buying an average barrels per day bpd in or around million barrels a month
