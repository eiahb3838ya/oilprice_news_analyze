struggle to control libyan oil ports adds to global supply worries
eastern noc bidding for authority over five ports noc in tripoli has international recognition battle for port control slashed libyan output tankers blocked from loading in two terminals by aidan lewis and ahmad ghaddar june reuters libyan oil production could face protracted disruption as factions in the east have sought to seize control of crude exports adding pressure to a tight global market
eastern factions have tried to take over oil exports in the past yet struggled to find buyers as western nations insist they will only deal with the internationally recognised national oil corporation noc based in the libyan capital of tripoli
but this has not stopped eastern forces from seeking control of the ports accusing libya s government of failing to share revenues fairly
the latest tussle for power has already slashed national production to about to barrels per day bpd after it had been running earlier this year at million bpd still well below the national output of million bpd before a uprising plunged libya into chaos
the damage to libyan output started with the latest series of battles over ras lanuf and es sider ports which have been closed for two weeks causing losses of some bpd
on thursday a parallel noc in the eastern city of benghazi started blocking tankers booked by the noc from loading at zueitina and hariga
the other port under eastern control is brega
the head of noc in tripoli mustafa sanalla writing in the financial times on thursday called the latest crisis by far the most dangerous of the challenges facing libya s oil industry since the uprising
combined exports from the five ports now under eastern control had been about bpd in may analytics firm vortexa said
we took delivery of the ports and we have authority over them now the head of noc in benghazi faraj said told reuters adding that orders had been issued to prevent any tanker entering that was not following its instructions
the oil market already under pressure from falling venezuelan and angolan output alongside worries about a squeeze on iranian supplies as sanctions bite remains tight even after opec and its allies agreed to ease their production curbs
any lost barrel from libya will be very painful said commerzbank analyst carsten fritsch
it could not have come at a more inconvenient time also in the context of the looming decline to zero of iranian oil shipments he said
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries russia and its allies agreed last week to return to percent compliance with cuts that have been in place since january instead of exceeding those curbs
but this brings its own pressure to the market
output increases will mostly be met by opec s de facto leader saudi arabia and russia and that means an erosion of the buffer of spare capacity that can relieve unexpected supply disruptions
libya s output had tumbled to as low as bpd in before last year s recovery to about million bpd
the turnaround was made possible in september when the libyan national army lna led by commander khalifa haftar took over blockaded oil ports including ras lanuf and es sider and allowed noc in tripoli to reopen them
but eastern factions reversed that policy in june accusing the central bank in tripoli of paying salaries to the lna s opponents and giving insufficient funds to the east
eastern officials have said they would send revenues to a parallel central bank based in the eastern town of bayda
yet those revenues may not flow easily
france s total which this year bought a percent stake in waha oil company that exports through es sider said it would only deal noc in tripoli in line and european demands
total is bound by international and libyan laws including united nations security council resolutions which demand that libya s oil facilities and exports remain under the exclusive control of noc it said referring the company in tripoli
the united states the european union and individual european states have repeated statements demanding that noc in tripoli have sole control although diplomats said the western warnings were delayed as efforts were made to reverse the move by eastern forces to put benghazi s noc in charge
