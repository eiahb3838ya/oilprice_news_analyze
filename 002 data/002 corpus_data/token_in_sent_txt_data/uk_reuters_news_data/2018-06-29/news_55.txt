update 1-china could impose 'special emissions' limits on firms in up to 80 cities
reuters china could impose special emissions restrictions on industrial firms in as many as cities extending the program from the current an environment ministry spokesman said on friday
china said in january that it would force industrial firms in northern chinese cities to meet tough new emissions curbs in a bid to cut smog in the heavily polluted region
enterprises in the thermal power steel petrochemical chemical metals and cement sectors will be forced to comply with as many as new emissions standards by october with coking coal producers given another year to make the required adjustments
but some have expressed concern that the tougher emissions restrictions would undermine efforts to create a level playing field raising production costs and making it harder to compete with rivals in other regions
as china increases curbs on emissions i believe the measures will be expanded to more regions said tian weiyong head of environmental inspections at the ministry of ecology and environment
but we might start with tighter emission standards in the cities he told reporters during a briefing in beijing
china s new smog action plan will cover the major regions of shanxi and shaanxi as well as the major manufacturing regions of and the yangtze river delta
inspectors will target scattered coal users in shanxi and shaanxi two major regions tian said
china has promised to end a one size fits all approach to curbing smog and will impose production curbs only on firms that fail to meet emission standards
tian of the environment ministry said china would also begin a round of inspections to ensure natural gas supplies are sufficient in northern china this winter
regulators are desperate to avoid a repetition of the fuel shortages that hit large parts of the region last winter as overzealous officials rushed to comply with directives to convert from coal to gas
