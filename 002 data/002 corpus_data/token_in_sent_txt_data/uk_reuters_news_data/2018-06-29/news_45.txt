exclusive-eu plea to industry to reuse more plastic lacks bite
reuters europe has pushed back a deadline for companies to volunteer to increase their use of recycled plastics in lieu of regulation showing how hard it is to end the continent s reliance on developing countries dealing with its waste
the pledges were due to have been made by the end of june under a european plastics strategy unveiled in january when china stopped taking the world s waste due to pollution concerns focusing minds on its environmental impact
an eu official said the deadline had been shifted to september after industry appealed for more time
that timeline makes the fallback option of legislation highly unlikely
the european union recycles only a quarter of the million tonnes of plastics waste it produces per year and about half of that was sent to china which uses recycled plastics to make products ranging from office furniture to cable coatings
the eu executive wants ten million tonnes of recycled plastics to be used in new products sold in the bloc by quadrupling demand
if company pledges do not tally up to that target it has said it will consider further measures including regulatory action after december
but few new laws will be put forth next year because of elections for european parliament and european commission head not to mention britain s scheduled exit from the bloc
the eu executive s focus is on pushing through its proposal to ban throwaway plastics such as cotton buds and plastic straws and new labelling rules for plastic waste
without a mix of incentives and regulation to spur demand for the waste industry says there will be no sea change in the market
recyclers in europe say they are planning to scale up capacity but that to make it worthwhile there need to be more buyers for recycled plastic closer to home
in the meantime they have found markets in other parts of asia for just over half the waste that used to go to china and say much of the rest is being incinerated raising the risk of backsliding in sorting efforts which vary widely across the eu
if china no longer imports plastic waste we can not tell europeans to stop sorting because we have no more buyers said boursier cfo and head of recycling at french group suez
the right answer is for authorities to change the paradigm and boost the incorporation of secondary divisions within the bloc and warnings from companies that incorporating recycled plastic will lower the quality of products and increase costs mean enforcing its target is difficult
some companies have come forward
among the more ambitious volvo owned by china s zhejiang geely holding group co ltd has said a quarter of plastics used in its models would be from recycled materials by while danone said its evian plastic bottles would be made from percent recycled plastic by then
austrian plastics maker borealis which makes plastics used in products from food packaging to cars also says it will invest more in coming years to produce completely recycled goods
the commission official said from all along the plastics value chain had shown interest in the pledging campaign we think it is possible to achieve this target on a voluntary but other eu sources admitted the political push hung on industry goodwill and it will be difficult to even asses whether promises amounted to enough to shift demand
borealis ceo alfred stern said it was an uphill battle to make recycling profitable
technologies need to be developed he told reuters
but the end goal needs to be commercial economic suez and fellow french water and waste group veolia europe s biggest recycling companies both see an eventual upside to china s restrictions with plastics waste a relatively small but growing part of their business
the impact of the ban on europe s recycling industry is enormous and while it is a disturbance in the short term over the long term it is a good business opportunity woldemar d ambri√®res head of plastics strategy at veolia said
unlike glass which is cheaper to produce from recycled glass than from silicate plastics are hard to sort and recycle economically in europe especially when oil prices are low
suez processes some tons of plastic waste and produces tons of recycled plastic per year
it wants to recycle all the waste it sorts and if market prices hold up will invest about million euros over the next three years to boost its recycling capacity to tonnes per year
we want industry to make water bottles from water bottles milk bottles from milk bottles shampoo bottles from shampoo bottles boursier said
veolia recycles about tonnes of plastics per year and aims to boost plastics recycling revenue to one billion euros per year by from million euros today
industry body plastics recyclers europe pre says many of the smaller companies which handle much of the continent s plastic waste also have plans to invest and some plastics producers are teaming up with recyclers
in november suez and major plastics manufacturer lyondellbasell together bought dutch plastics recycler qcp while borealis bought two german plastics recyclers in
the plastics industry did not do enough to close the loop said pre director antonino furfari
it realises now that the way to do that is to invest in additional reporting by alister doyle in oslo and ludwig burger in frankfurt editing by philippa fletcher
