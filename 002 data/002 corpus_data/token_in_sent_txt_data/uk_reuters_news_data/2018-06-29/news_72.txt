update 3-officials at libya's zueitina oil port stop noc tripoli tanker docking -sources
control of ports handed to noc ports give authorities in charge control of oil exports eu says will not allow oil trade outside recognised channels adds loading blocked at hariga by ayman benghazi libya june reuters officials at libya s zueitina oil port have not authorised a tanker contracted by national oil corporation noc to berth while loading was also blocked at hariga terminal port and industry sources said on thursday
zueitina and hariga are among the oil ports that the libyan national army lna said on monday it would transfer to a parallel noc which is based in the eastern city of benghazi after fighting this month at the ras lanuf and es sider terminals
the ports are vital to controlling crude exports the north african nation s main source of revenue although shifting who controls the terminals creates uncertainty for international buyers of oil and may cause a suspension of exports
operations at zueitina hariga and brega which is also under the control of eastern forces had appeared to be running normally until thursday
one tanker the felicity finished loading million barrels at zueitina on thursday under contract from noc tripoli
but a second tanker amore mio ii was waiting in the port area without permission to berth sources said
a tanker had entered hariga but had not completed loading because of a lack of authorisation said an official from the arabian gulf oil company agoco which runs the terminal
the official said production at messla and sarir fields would have to be reduced if loading remained blocked
the head of the parallel noc faraj said told reuters he had ordered ports to prevent the entry of any tanker not authorised by his office
combined exports from the five ports which are now under lna control were about bpd in may and bpd for june according to analytics firm vortexa
ras lanuf and es sider have been closed since june when opponents of the lna attacked the ports before being driven out a week later
the parallel noc in benghazi has previously tried and failed to market oil independently of noc in tripoli which is recognised by security council resolutions as the only legitimate producer and seller of libyan oil
the european union said on thursday it would continue to counter any attempt to trade libyan oil outside the internationally recognised official channels
the united states france britain and italy made a similar statement on wednesday
eastern factions say they moved to take control of oil exports because revenues going to the central bank in tripoli were being used to fund militias that attacked the lna and that not enough cash was reaching the east
they have said they will try to sell oil through noc in benghazi with proceeds going to a parallel central bank based in the east
the noc in tripoli made a new appeal on thursday for the lna to hand back operational control of ras lanuf and es sider
noc reminds its stakeholders it has repeatedly called for transparency over the distribution of oil revenues it said
