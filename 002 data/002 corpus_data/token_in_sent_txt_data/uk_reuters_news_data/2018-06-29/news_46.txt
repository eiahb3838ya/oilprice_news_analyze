bp holds millions of barrels of oil off china as demand falters
reuters four supertankers chartered by energy major bp have been held up or delayed off china s east coast over the last two months unable to fully discharge oil as slowing demand from the country s private refiners starts to impact global markets
two of the four very large crude carriers vlccs are still off shandong province holding half their cargoes of angolan crude oil and another is headed back there from south korea according to trade flow data in thomson reuters eikon and two shipping sources who track these vessels
it s not clear why the tankers have had so much trouble offloading all their oil or if bp had first secured buyers for the million barrels worth more than million at current market prices that was loaded onto the vessels out of africa
bp has declined to comment on the matter
what is apparent is that the fortunes of china s independent refiners often called teapots have turned for the worse amid escalating global trade tensions rising crude oil prices an oversupplied domestic fuel market and tighter government tax scrutiny
either it s because of lower run rates curbing teapots buying or the buyers are having problems paying said an executive with a western trading house
while an executive at an independent shandong refiner said the market is bad weak demand as plants come under policy headwinds with the tax rules biting into both executives declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly about commercial operations

but having cargoes orphaned for two months is less common several oil traders and shippers said
paying for supertankers each half a kilometre miles long to wait in open seas to unload is costly as well
although it is not known at what rate bp chartered the four vessels shippers estimate the daily charter rate for a vlcc is now about a day
so four chartered vlccs sitting idle for a month would cost bp around million
bp declined to comment on the cost of having the tankers waiting off china to unload oil
several traders and shippers said bp was unlikely the only seller caught off guard by the slowdown in demand and the teapots troubles although all said stranded cargoes of this size and duration is rare
among the four ships the texas has been held up the longest
it discharged part of its angolan crude load in at qingdao and was slated to offload the rest of its cargo at rizhao another port in shandong shortly after
instead the texas has been anchored off the coast until this week when it discharged tonnes on thursday according to a port source with knowledge of the matter
another vlcc the olympic light has been floating near qingdao after discharging part of its cargo on may and may now be heading to the port to discharge the rest of its crude
the mercury hope a third vlcc has been looking for a home for its remaining cargo after it discharged part of it at qingdao in late may
a fourth vlcc olympic luck planned to deliver crude to qingdao in early may but turned away and transferred half of its cargo this week to a smaller tanker off nagasaki japan and then sailed towards south korea
now it has turned back and is heading towards rizhao still with oil onboard according to shipping data on eikon
the ship is scheduled to unload its cargo later on friday said emma li an analyst with thomson reuters oil research and forecasts
