update 2-enbridge: no plans to use own security during line 3 construction
adds enbridge comments on construction apportionment activist comment by rod nickel paul june reuters enbridge inc will not hire private security during construction of its line oil pipeline as it seeks to avoid the violence that erupted between protesters and security at the dakota access pipeline dapl a senior enbridge official said on friday
no one wants a dakota access situation said guy jarvis enbridge s executive of liquids pipelines and major projects in an interview
we certainly don t plan to be engaging our own security efforts as a replacement or a supplement to the official law enforcement agencies
that s the minnesota public utilities commission on thursday approved a rebuild of line
opponents vowed to stop the project comparing their efforts to dapl protests
protests of dapl initially were peaceful but tensions rose after protesters were and attacked by security dogs
in late the number of protesters multiplied and they were hit with tear gas and water cannons in freezing weather
enbridge has a minority stake in energy transfer partners dapl pipeline
we re here to make sure that nobody gets hurt jarvis said
if you employ your own security to do law enforcement you re broadening your responsibilities to an area where we don t believe we should enbridge shares rose percent on friday
winona laduke executive director of the honor the earth activist group said she is pretty skeptical that enbridge will leave security to police
during dapl protests laduke said she asked enbridge to get involved to no avail
i asked them to that situation she said
jarvis said enbridge expects to have full authorization to build by november
construction could start in early
a possible surplus of canadian pipeline space in a few years factoring in line the trans mountain and transcanada corp s keystone xl is not a significant risk to line s business case although each pipeline company will bear some brunt jarvis said
currently space is so tight on enbridge s mainline network that it rations space to shippers called apportionment
enbridge proposed a modified system in may before withdrawing it over concerns by oil shippers
this time the company intends to work through a national energy board neb regulatory process to find a solution this year jarvis said
there is such a gulf in views that no matter what we do at our own discretion we re going to get challenged at the neb he said
we hope to come up with something that has a degree of support from reporting by rod nickel in paul minnesota editing by susan thomas
