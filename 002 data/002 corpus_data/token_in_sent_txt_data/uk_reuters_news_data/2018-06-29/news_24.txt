clean fuel? methane leaks threaten natural gas' climate-friendly image
washington reuters executives from natural gas companies call their increasingly cheap and plentiful fuel the world s best answer to climate change it produces about half the carbon dioxide of coal when burned in a power plant and it can fuel trucks trains and ships
while some outside the industry see natural gas as but a stepping stone to a future when all energy will be provided by wind solar and other renewable sources this idea of natural gas as a transition fuel to renewables is strange total sa chief executive patrick pouyanne said
natural gas is a solution he said this week at the world gas conference in washington the industry s biggest global summit
but environmentalists regulators and many in the industry itself warn of a dirty underbelly to natural gas or methane
before it is burned it is one of the most potent greenhouse gases and can reach the atmosphere through leaks in wellheads compressor stations and chemicals plants
a study published in the scientific journal nature last week put methane emissions from the oil and gas industry at about million metric tonnes per year percent higher than the official environmental protection agency estimate
carbon dioxide emissions from energy sources meanwhile are around billion tonnes
the united states is the world s top natural gas producer one of its biggest crude oil producers and a growing exporter of both thanks to improved drilling technology that has vastly increased output
while methane emissions are relatively small compared to carbon dioxide they are a major force in global warming
scientists say methane can trap more than times more heat than carbon in the first years after escaping into the atmosphere
methane emissions are responsible for percent of the warming our planet is experiencing right now mark brownstein of the environmental defense fund edf told reuters
he added that the united states as a top producer has a responsibility to properly track emissions and reduce them
president donald trump however has been seeking to roll back environmental rules to allow companies to rapidly boost output
last year his administration halted an regulation that would have required drillers on federal land to curb methane leaks calling it redundant
the administration is taking the industry backwards and feeding into the narrative that fossil fuels are bad for the world said fred krupp president of the edf
while some have challenged the methane study s conclusions energy executives at the triennial summit said industry should instead review them and learn
i do believe that we have to acknowledge this is an issue said bernard looney chief executive of upstream with bp plc
gas will not win the argument that it needs to win if we don t all put methane as an issue on the the stakes are high for the industry
global demand for liquefied natural gas lng a form of the fuel that can be transported globally by ship has jumped percent in the last five years according to data from the energy information administration
lng demand is projected to rise another percent this year and keep growing thanks to a rapid uptick in imports by china and other nations seeking to offset power plants to reduce pollution
i see that there s a very important role for gas in cleaning the energy mix said rachel kyte chief executive of sustainable energy for all
but let s not leave the room with the elephant still here untouched
you have to plug that methane the bulk of global methane leakage comes from flaring where gas produced as a byproduct of crude oil drilling is burned off because there are no pipelines yet available to take it to market
a lot also leaks from old inefficient facilities that need to be upgraded or replaced
as a result of the leaks about billion worth of fuel vanishes into the air annually according to the edf
those financial losses are a spur for major oil and gas players to voluntarily take steps to reduce leaks
greg guidry shell s evp of unconventionals called voluntary action critical because if you just wait for regulation there will be a hell of a lot more methane emitted in the sara ortwein president of xto energy inc a natural gas subsidiary of exxon mobil said work still must be done to make solutions more cost effective and requirements for leak detection could be a reasonable part of a sound pratima rangarajan chief executive of ogci climate investments said global standards are needed in the longer term
what we need for scale is for everybody to do it because you have to across the world and in every country she said
for brownstein of the edf the solution is simple
inexpensive monitoring equipment like infrared cameras and drones can slash methane emissions along with operation changes
a lot of this is not rocket science he said
