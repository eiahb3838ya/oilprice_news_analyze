update 1-turkey says will not cut off trade ties to iran at behest of others
ankara reuters turkey will not cut off trade ties with iran at the behest of other countries turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu said on friday after the united states told countries to cut all imports of iranian oil
washington has told its allies to cut imports of iranian oil by november a senior state department official said this week as president donald trump looks to cut off funding to iran
trump in may said his administration was withdrawing from the defective nuclear deal agreed by iran and six world powers
if the united states decisions are aimed at peace and stability then we ll support them but we don t have to follow every decision
being allies doesn t mean following every decision word for word cavusoglu told broadcaster ntv in an interview
iran is a good neighbour and we have economic ties
we are not going to cut off our trade ties with iran because other countries told us turkey a nato ally is dependent on imports for almost all of its energy needs
in the first four months of this year turkey bought million tonnes of crude oil from iran almost percent of its total crude supplies according to data from the turkish energy watchdog epdk
president tayyip erdogan last year said turkey was looking to raise the volume of its annual trade with iran to billion from billion
cavusoglu also said that there were no problems with the procurement of warplanes from the united states so far and he did not think there would be any problems in the future
a senate committee passed its version of a billion defence policy bill last month including a measure to prevent turkey from purchasing lockheed martin joint strike fighter jets
the amendment to the bill would remove turkey from the programme over its detention of pastor andrew brunson
brunson a christian pastor faces up to years in prison on terrorism and spying charges which he denies
cavusoglu said turkey had conveyed discomfort about the issue to trump who said necessary steps would be taken
