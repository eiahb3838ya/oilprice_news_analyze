nordic power surge will not deter facebook's data centre plans
oslo reuters a surge in power prices in the nordic countries will not deter facebook from looking at building data centres in the region a company spokeswoman said
sweden and norway have traditionally had low electricity prices making them attractive locations for data centres that big digital companies need for their operations
microsoft recently announced plans to build two data centres in norway and facebook last month decided to expand its data centre in sweden s northern city of lulea strengthening its nordic operations
but power prices in sweden and norway are now double those of as inflows of water to hydropower reservoirs are expected to decline this year
facebook spokeswoman camilla nordsted said we take a view towards our investments and the ingredients that make them she said the company would not be affected by unusual power price levels in the region as facebook had signed a power purchase agreement ppa with three new wind farms in norway
the ppa term provides the financial certainty necessary for the projects to be financed constructed and operated she said
in june power prices in norway surged above euros per megawatt hour double year on year but the price is only one of the variables facebook is considering
supportive state and local partners a site good access to fibre and power access to renewable energy a strong pool of talent for construction and operations staff are important things to consider nordsted said
facebook is working on evaluating a number of potential new sites for its operations that it aims to power with energy nordsted said but she declined to identify specific plans at this stage
outside the united states facebook currently has or has planned data centres in ireland sweden and denmark according to data published by the company
norway and sweden recently lowered their data centre taxes to attract more investments in the region which is rich in power from renewable energy sources such as hydropower dams and wind farms
