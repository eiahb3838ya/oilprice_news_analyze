planning a wind farm in norway? connecting to grid from 2019 may cost you
oslo reuters a norwegian plan to force big power consumers and producers to pay for grid upgrades and extensions could disrupt new projects from wind farms and data centres to ventures in the oil industry companies told reuters
beginning in norway s water resources and energy directorate nve wants firms benefiting from grid additions to pay up to half the investment cost often a major sum in remote regions seeking to attract industry and jobs
nve which by monday will issue an amended draft of its plan aims to cut overall costs and distribute them fairly by encouraging big consumers and producers to build their facilities in locations that already have strong grids
investments of around billion are planned to take place between the regulator said and companies consuming or producing power fear they would have to foot a significant part of the bill
grid cost is important for future investment opportunities
seen in connection with proposed higher tariffs for the industry in norway total grid cost is becoming a challenge said metals firm norsk hydro the country s largest power consumer
hydro argued that the change if imposed should be accompanied by cuts in the fees paid to stay connected to the grid but such a reduction was not part of the plan nve section head torfinn jonassen said
power producers statkraft and agder energi said that while the plan may benefit society it could raise the costs for future renewable energy projects
this can be a discouraging factor for power production investments located in areas with a weak power grid an agder spokesman said
the projects that are most likely to be affected are wind power plants he added but big consumers such as data centers that norway aims to attract will have to reassess where to build their facilities as well
last week microsoft announced plans to build two new data centres in norway in an agreement with the country s largest firm equinor
the regulation will have an effect on where companies will want to build wind farms data centres or factories and their cost said nve s jonassen
microsoft declined to comment on the regulatory change
norway s oil and gas association said the rules could raise the cost of supplying electricity to offshore oil platforms as well as for grid upgrades planned at onshore facilities such as the nyhamna gas processing plant
a transitional regime taking into account binding commitments made before january will be included in the plan nve said
the regulator has the authority to unilaterally impose the changes
