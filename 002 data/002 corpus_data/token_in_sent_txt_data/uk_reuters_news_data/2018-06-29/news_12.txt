pompeo tells china continued north korea sanctions enforcement needed
washington reuters secretary of state mike pompeo has stressed to china the importance of continued enforcement of sanctions on north korea to press it to give up its nuclear weapons after warning of signs of backsliding by beijing
the state department said pompeo had spoken to his chinese counterpart wang yi on thursday and discussed efforts to achieve our shared goal of the complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the korean pompeo reiterated that north korea would have a bright future if it denuclearised and emphasized the continued importance of full enforcement of all relevant un security council resolutions related to north korea the department said in a statement
it said this was especially important when it came to preventing north korea s illegal export of coal and imports of refined petroleum through transfers prohibited by the united nations
president donald trump who held an unprecedented summit with north korean leader kim jong un on june to try to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons programme that threatens the united states urged continued sanctions efforts by beijing last week and said the border between china and north korea was getting a little weaker officials have expressed concern that recent international engagement with pyongyang could lead countries to relax sanctions pressure
pompeo told a senate hearing this week he had seen modest backsliding by china north korea s neighbour and main trading partner which trump has courted on the nuclear issue even while threatening a major trade war with beijing
we have observed china not enforcing control over their areas as vigorously as they were six or months ago pompeo said
in april the security council blacklisted dozens of ships and shipping companies over oil and coal smuggling by north korea including five based in china
on wednesday japan s kyodo news agency said tokyo had alerted the about a suspected transfer incident on june involving a north korean tanker in the east china sea
pompeo also spoke with south korean foreign minister kang on thursday to discuss the next steps on engagement with north korea the state department said
it said they agreed on the need to maintain pressure until north korea denuclearises
on thursday the financial times quoted officials as saying that pompeo plans to travel to north korea next week for talks but the state department has declined to confirm this
pompeo said last week he likely would go back to north korea before too terribly long to try to flesh out commitments made at the meeting
trump has been criticized by security analysts for agreeing a joint statement in his summit with kim that gave no details on how or when north korea which has rejected unilateral disarmament might surrender its nuclear weapons
