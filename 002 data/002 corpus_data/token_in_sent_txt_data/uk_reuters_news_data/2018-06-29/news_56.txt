explainer-trans-korea gas pipeline project reappears, but challenges remain
seoul reuters the and much derided gas pipeline project is back on the agenda buoyed by hopes north and south korea can make peace
if realized it would be a pipeline for south korea
lacking its own energy resources or pipelines to regions with gas south korea has been shipping the fuel in on tankers as liquefied natural gas lng
based on trade data and average lng prices in that cost south korea around billion in
with lng prices rising this year s tab will likely be even bigger
with relations between north and south warming albeit from levels the idea of constructing a km mile long pipeline to bring russian gas through north korea to the south s industrial hubs has been revived
the project is now part of south korea s new northern policy
south korean president moon and his russian counterpart vladimir putin last week agreed to strengthen energy cooperation as north korea s neighbours push for denuclearisation of the korean peninsula
korea gas corp kogas and russian state gas company gazprom will conduct a joint pipeline study according south korea s energy ministry
despite the renewed enthusiasm the project remains riddled with risks and challenges
to view russia to korea gas pipeline map click estimating pipeline development costs is notoriously difficult with most projects ending up far above initial estimates
land pipelines in europe and north america of similar length have cost between billion to develop
still piped gas tends to be cheaper than lng due to the cost of liquefaction by the producer and regasification by the importer
what s more relying entirely on lng imports exposes south korea s industry to a volatile market prone to price spikes
should shipping lanes ever get interrupted south korea would even risk running out of gas
assuming relations with the north normalise and remain good tapping russia s enormous reserves would bring a steady flow of gas to south korea improving security of supply and reducing exposure to lng price shocks
for a graphic on south korea lng imports click the pipeline was included in a memorandum of understanding between kogas and gazprom
the plan was to supply million tonnes of russian gas annually over years from vladivostok into north korea and on to the south starting from
but the agreement fell apart after the death of north korean leader kim jong il and as north korea advanced it nuclear weapons programme said park professor of energy policy at korea polytechnic university
the risk of handing north korea the power to interrupt supplies to the south were deemed too big
but as we re heading in the direction of peace the likelihood of the gas pipeline has increased said park
critics however also point to disputes between russia ukraine and the european union over pipeline supplies and fees which showed moscow s willingness to use its gas as a political tool
beyond political risk the biggest hurdle is sanctions which block joint ventures with north korean firms prohibit financial transactions with north korea and forbid sales and purchases of commodities
president donald trump has said sanctions on north korea would remain in place until it is
because of the conflict in ukraine there are also and european sanctions against russia preventing western firms from participating in russian oil and gas projects
should all obstacles be cleared the pipeline could be completed within three years according to south korea s posco research institute
to sweeten the deal for north korea which suffers from chronic electricity shortages a power station could be built there
north korea can also benefit by receiving transit fees or having gas infrastructure said kim a senior research fellow at energy think tank korea energy economics institute
based on comparable european pipelines transit fees for north korea would be around million annually according to park
despite the project s improving prospects critics say it would be safer to import more gas from south korea s most powerful ally the united states
thanks to a boom in shale gas production lng exports are soaring including to south korea
shipping data shows lng supplies to south korea this year already surpassed those of all jumping from million tonnes in to million tonnes in the first half of
