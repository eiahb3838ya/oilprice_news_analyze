update 6-minnesota regulator approves rebuild of enbridge pipeline
paul reuters a minnesota regulator on thursday approved a certificate of need for enbridge inc to rebuild its line oil pipeline angering environmentalists but offering hope to western canadian oil producers that have struggled to move crude oil to refiners
the minnesota public utilities commission s decision clears the final major hurdle pending possible appeals in enbridge s effort to rebuild its aging corroded pipeline that runs from alberta in western canada to wisconsin
shares of calgary enbridge closed up percent in toronto
the commission also approved a route that closely follows enbridge s preference and will take line over a new corridor for part of its path
the certificate of need has conditions including that enbridge make a financial guarantee to clean up any environmental damage and that it remove at landowners request pipeline that is no longer in use
pipeline bottlenecks have steepened a price discount for western canadian heavy crude this year
refiners in minnesota and surrounding states say line is necessary to increase crude supplies
shouts from native americans and environmental activists interrupted the meeting
shame on you you cowards one woman shouted before breaking into tears
environmental groups and some indigenous communities oppose the project over concerns about spills and impact on tribal wild rice harvesting areas
what they have done to us today is egregious said winona laduke executive director of honor the earth activist group
they have gotten their standing rock
we will do everything that is needed to stop this the standing rock tribe led opposition in to the dakota access pipeline in north dakota one of the most bitterly contested energy projects in years
it was eventually built
the coalition of line opponents is likely to formally request that the commission reconsider its approval said joe plumer lawyer for white earth nation
business and labor groups say the billion project of which billion would be spent in minnesota will create jobs and tax revenue
it s going to give everybody a real boost said bob schoneberger who runs a piping contractor business in duluth minnesota
enbridge chief executive al monaco said in a statement that he was pleased with the commission s decisions and said the project s cost was materially unchanged
he said he continues to expect the rebuilt pipeline to begin service in the second half of
line which began service in operates at half its capacity
its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of barrels per day
that pipeline is an accident waiting to happen said commissioner dan lipschultz
it feels like a gun to our head that compels us to approve a new line but the gun is real and it s several commissioners voiced doubts that demand for crude oil and refined products such as gasoline would grow enough to warrant the pipeline
but enbridge s rationing of demand from oil shippers for space on line was more convincing of a need to rebuild said chairwoman nancy lange
the rebuilt line will follow the existing pipeline path partway through minnesota before veering south to bypass leech lake reserve and avoid a need to shut down the pipeline for up to one year during construction
the path of a short stretch near fond du lac reserve will be determined by negotiations between the tribe and enbridge
tribes in the area had said enbridge s preferred route was the worst of numerous options
fond du lac lawyer seth bichler told the commission that the tribes preferred a longer route to the south that would avoid more sensitive land
recognized parties including enbridge environmental and indigenous groups have days from the time a written order is issued likely in a couple of weeks to ask the commission to reconsider
if such an application is denied a party can then appeal to minnesota s appeals court
line also requires additional permits from local state and federal levels minnesota governor mark dayton said in a statement
approvals are by no means assured he said
