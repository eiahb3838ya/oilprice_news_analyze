iran cleric calls for calm after days of protests - fars news agency
ankara reuters the leader of friday prayers in tehran called for calm and fortitude after days of protests by the capital s grand bazaar traders fuming over the plunging value of iran s currency and rising prices the fars news agency reported
three days of protests in tehran and other cities began on sunday when hundreds of traders in the bazaar the hub of merchants who backed iran s islamic revolution that ousted the longtime monarch closed their shops to voice their anger at currency plunges
iran s rial has lost percent of its value since president donald trump s decision on may to pull the united states out of iran s nuclear deal with world powers and reimpose tough economic sanctions on tehran
our enemies want to harm us by creating chaos remain calm and resist the economic hardship we will overcome all difficulties if we remain united and resist the pressure shi ite cleric kazem seddighi told worshippers in tehran
thousands of people including merchants took to the streets on sunday and marched towards the parliament building where they shouted slogans against iranian authorities
riot police clashed with protesters and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds
the protests resembled nationwide demonstrations in january that were originally sparked by economic hardships but turned political
however the protests earlier this year took place largely in iran s provinces rather than in tehran
trump has ramped up pressure on allies to cut off purchases of iranian oil which accounts for percent of the islamic republic s income
watching their savings dwindle and shopkeepers hold onto some of their goods iranians fear new sanctions will also see sharp rises in the price of food including rice bread and dairy products
those hoarders are hurting the economy bring the goods to your shops from storages seddighi said
most international sanctions imposed on iran were lifted in early under the nuclear deal that saw iran curbing its disputed nuclear programme under close monitoring
the bazaar strike was the biggest sign of domestic disquiet in iran since trump ditched the nuclear deal
the pact was the centrepiece of president hassan rouhani s promise to modernise iran s economy that won him two landslide elections but has yet to bring widespread tangible benefits for many iranians
