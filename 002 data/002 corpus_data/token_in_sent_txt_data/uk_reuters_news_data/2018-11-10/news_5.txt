update 1-rouhani says new u.s. sanctions have no effect on iran economy
dubai reuters iranian president hassan rouhani said on saturday that sanctions announced last week have had no effect on iran s economy because washington had already practically reimposed them earlier
the restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by president donald trump to force iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy forces in yemen syria lebanon and other parts of the middle east
the sanctions have had no impact on our economy because america had already used all the weapons at its disposal and there was nothing new to use against us rouhani said in remarks carried live on state television
they just issued a long list of banks their branches and airlines and their planes
and this shows that they are merely trying to affect the iranian nation psychologically rouhani said
the united states said it would temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying iranian oil when it reimposed sanctions last monday aimed at forcing tehran to curb its nuclear missile and regional activities
it has now become clear that america can not cut iran s oil exports to zero rouhani added speaking after a weekly meeting with the heads of the parliament and the judiciary
in may trump exited iran s nuclear deal with six powers and washington reimposed a first round of sanctions on iran in august
