rpt-rocket fuel: australia targets hydrogen as next big energy export
repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text eyes on bln hydrogen market in asia by production cost seen as biggest hurdle japan s kawasaki heavy industries working to drive down costs woodside sees blue hydrogen from gas as key to scale by sonali paul melbourne nov reuters australia the world s biggest coal exporter and liquefied natural gas lng exporter wants to build its next big energy industry around exploiting solar and wind power along with brown coal to produce hydrogen
the same fuel used to power rockets into space hydrogen has untapped energy potential without the downside of the carbon emissions from natural gas and coal
australia is seeking to supply what could be a billion market for hydrogen to china japan south korea and singapore by according to a report done for the australian renewable energy agency by consultants acil allen
while initially just a fraction of australia s lng exports forecast at a billion billion in hydrogen exports could grow the same way that australia s lng industry has over the past years according to acil allen the australian government and local gas producer woodside petroleum
the global drive to cut carbon emissions and the falling cost of wind and solar power has turned hydrogen fuel into an opportunity now after the idea was mooted more than four decades ago
many of our traditional gas markets japan korea have adopted strategies that put hydrogen and ultimately renewable hydrogen at the core of their energy future
so we want to make sure we ve got the capability of providing for that market western australia s regional development minister alannah mactiernan told reuters
the state on launched a renewable hydrogen council including woodside french power producer engie sa and norway s yara international to form a plan to use land wind and solar resources to produce hydrogen
the development of a hydrogen business is similar to the early days of the lng business said shaun gregory woodside s executive vice president for exploration and technology
to reduce global warming hydrogen could be used in fuel cells for vehicles and manufacturing plants and could eventually replace natural gas for space heating water heating and cooking in homes
output may start through the gasification of brown coal with the hydrogen and carbon dioxide separated out
but eventually wind and solar power would be used to crack water to become the biggest hydrogen source
currently hydrogen derived from coal gasification is cheaper to produce than from water
the goal is drive down the costs of a hydrogen cargo by to a level that japanese buyers would accept said australia s chief scientist alan finkel who is advising the government on a hydrogen strategy
the biggest potential is that we can t meet the price target he told reuters
japan s kawasaki heavy industries khi is leading a a million demonstration project to produce hydrogen from brown coal from australia s largest coal mine loy yang in victoria
at this point it is clearly cheaper than hydrogen from renewables but in the future they might be the same khi executive officer eiichi harada told reuters at the conference in melbourne on
meanwhile woodside is working with korea gas corp to potentially produce blue hydrogen in a process of reforming methane from natural gas while eventually shifting to solar or wind to crack water to make green hydrogen we believe blue hydrogen carbon neutral hydrogen sourced from gas is the key to building scale and lowering costs in hydrogen transport and distribution which will enable an earlier transition to green hydrogen woodside s gregory said in an email
