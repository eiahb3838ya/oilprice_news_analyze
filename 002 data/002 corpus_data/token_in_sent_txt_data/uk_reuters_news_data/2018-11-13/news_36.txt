oil majors spending 'sweet spot' to last to 2020 -blackrock
london reuters big oil is today in a spending sweet spot as years of cost cuts and rising oil prices converge but investments will need to rise after to boost output blackrock the world s largest asset manager said on tuesday
oil and gas giants such as royal dutch shell chevron and bp are generating as much cash at today s oil prices of around a barrel as they did in before crude spiraled down from over a barrel to lows of below a barrel
as they emerge from the deepest downturn in decades boards have vowed to remain thrifty and stick to lower spending targets in order to return value to shareholders after years of pain
alastair bishop director and portfolio manager in blackrock s natural resources team which has major holdings in the world s five largest oil and gas companies said he did not expect capital expenditure or capex to rise in the near term
it is a sweet spot for iocs international oil companies where they have relatively low cost inflation a reasonable oil price and at these levels they can generate significant cashflow to go toward paying down debt and share buybacks bishop told reuters in an interview

unlike earlier in the decade when oil companies raced to grow production to meet soaring demand in china boards are today focused on returns from investments bishop said
i am not sure investors are wanting large iocs to be chasing growth
there is much greater interest in generating returns and free cash but given the nature of the business where fields naturally decline as they age and take years to develop investments will have to grow after to avoid a dip in production
would i be surprised if beyond capex budgets start to move higher
no i wouldn t
there will be a little cost inflation and they will need to start thinking about their production profile into the bishop said
the appetite for huge projects such as deepwater oil fields and large gas processing facilities that became the trademark for big oil has however weakened bishop said
instead companies should opt for and phased projects where spending is better controlled such as shale oil and offshore field expansions as well as and gas projects such as chemical plants and power generation he added
there seems to be less appetite for just ploughing money straight back into the ground according to bishop
from our side unless you have new opportunities right at the bottom of the cost curve we are not that desperate for you to drive volume growth in terms of graphic big oil cashflow blackrock sees the transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner energy happening faster than many oil companies expect with oil demand peaking in the early bishop said around a decade earlier than most other forecasts
but what role oil majors will play in the transition remains unclear
europe s energy giants have stepped up investments in energies following the landmark paris climate agreement in contrast with their rivals
levels the europeans are spending in that area look entirely reasonable to me bishop said
