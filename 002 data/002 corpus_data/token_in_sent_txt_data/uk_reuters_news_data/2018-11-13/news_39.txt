update 1-global oil demand under growing threat from electric cars, cleaner fuel
london reuters electric vehicles and more efficient fuel technology will cut transportation demand for oil by more than previously expected but the world may still face a supply crunch without enough investment in new production the international energy agency iea said on tuesday
oil demand is not expected to peak before the iea said in its world energy outlook
the iea s central scenario is for demand to grow by around million barrels per day bpd on average every year to before settling at a steadier rate of bpd to when it will peak at million bpd
in the new policies scenario demand in has been revised up by more than million bpd compared with last year s outlook largely because of faster growth and changes to fuel efficiency policies in the united states the agency said
graphic oil supply outlook the iea believes there will be around million electric vehicles on the road by no change on its estimate a year ago
but it now expects those vehicles will cut demand by million bpd up from a previous estimated loss of million bpd in its last world energy outlook

efficiency measures are even more important to stem oil demand growth improvements in the efficiency of the car fleet avoid over million bpd of oil demand in the iea said
oil demand for road transport is expected to reach million bpd by up from million bpd in while industrial and petrochemical demand is forecast to reach million bpd by from million bpd in
graphic oil supply and demand outllok all global oil demand growth will stem from developing economies led by china and india while demand in advanced economies is expected to drop by more than bpd on average each year to the iea said
the iea which advises western governments on energy policy maintained its forecast for the global car fleet to nearly double by from today growing by percent to billion
on the supply side the united states already the world s biggest producer will dominate output growth to with an increase of million bpd from current levels around million bpd
from that point onwards the iea expects oil production to decline and the market share of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries will climb to percent by from closer to percent today
graphic electricity demand growth new sources of supply will be needed whether or not demand peaks the agency said
the analysis shows oil consumption growing in coming decades due to rising petrochemicals trucking and aviation demand
but meeting this growth in the near term means that approvals of conventional oil projects need to double from their current low levels iea director fatih birol said
without such a in investment shale production which has already been expanding at record pace would have to add more than million bpd from today to the equivalent of adding another russia to global supply in seven years which would be an historically unprecedented reporting by amanda cooper editing by mark potter
