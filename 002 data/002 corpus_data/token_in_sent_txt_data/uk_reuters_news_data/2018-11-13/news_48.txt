column-china still wants lng this winter, but not every last drop: russell
launceston australia reuters the liquefied natural gas lng market in asia appears to be coming to terms with the likelihood that china will still buy robust volumes over winter but not quite at the rate it did last year
in the winter of china s unrestrained appetite for the fuel drove spot prices to what was then a high upending a market that had previously believed a supply surplus was looming
however this time around china appears to be managing its winter demand in a more orderly fashion
that means while it will still likely increase cargoes in the coming months it won t be trying to suck every available drop of lng from the market
having been caught short of natural gas last winter china has taken steps to ensure that the coming winter will see adequate supplies
it has boosted storage facilities and domestic output while maximising use of pipelines from asia and lng terminals are being maximised
graphic china lng imports vs spot price china has expanded use of natural gas in winter primarily for heating as part of its policy of burning less coal in order to improve air quality
domestic natural gas production rose percent to billion cubic metres bcm equivalent to about million tonnes of lng in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period last year according to official data
natural gas imports from both lng and pipelines were up percent in the first months of the year to million tonnes
oil and gas major sinopec said on monday that it will boost its supply of natural gas for the heating season by percent from last winter to bcm and that its three lng receiving terminals are fully booked for december and january
petrochina another oil and gas major said on monday that the central pipeline will operate at percent capacity this winter and supply a record million cubic metres of natural gas per day
the separate announcements on the same day by china s two largest oil and gas companies is an illustration that beijing is determined that this winter won t see a repeat of last year s supply crunch and price spike
so far the market seems to be in agreement with the spot price actually weakening from late september to early november a period when it has started rising in past years
spot cargoes for december were assessed last week at per million british thermal units mmbtu up cents from the prior week and the first gain in six weeks
the decline in spot lng prices over the past two months and the tentative move higher last week contrast with the percent surge in prices last year between late august and the peak of per mmbtu reached in the week to
some chinese lng buyers have scaled back their winter purchase plans and are cargoes in the spot market wen wang a senior consultant at wood mackenzie said in a note on monday
industrial switching in the second half of could fall short of expectations reflected by weak domestic lng prices the consultant said
policy signals also suggest that winter switching in the heating sector could be moderate compared to last china did boost lng imports in october from september according to and port data compiled by refinitiv
imports were million tonnes in october up from million in september but down from august s million
for november the shipping data suggest that imports will be at least million tonnes although that figure can still rise as more vessels depart for china from asian and australian producers
the overall message is that while china is still the key growth market for lng it s unlikely to exert the same influence on prices this winter as it did last year
