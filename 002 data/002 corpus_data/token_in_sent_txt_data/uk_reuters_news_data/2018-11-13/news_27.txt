iowa senator says expect fewer biofuel waivers from wheeler's epa
washington reuters the environmental protection agency epa may issue fewer biofuel waivers to small refineries under acting administrator andrew wheeler than it did under its previous leadership republican senator chuck grassley of iowa said on tuesday
i sense that wheeler has a feeling that former administrator scott pruitt was very liberal on his issuing of waivers grassley told a conference call
asked if he thought such an attitude change could lead to fewer waivers grassley one of the most powerful voices for agriculture interests said the small refinery waiver program is among the most controversial issues dividing the corn industry and big oil
under the renewable fuel standard rfs refiners are required to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the nation s fuel supply each year to help expand the market for farm products
but small refineries can apply for waivers if they demonstrate that complying would cause them hardship
under pruitt the number of waivers granted to small refiners soared angering the biofuels industry which argued the program was being used to benefit energy companies while undermining demand for fuel
wheeler took over the epa in july after pruitt resigned in a flurry of ethical controversies
while wheeler has said little about his approach to the small refinery waiver program he has said he would like to introduce reforms to the rfs that can please both the energy and agriculture industries
at trump s direction the epa is currently working on a proposal to expand sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends year round a move meant to help corn growers stung by soft domestic demand and a loss of export markets from trade disputes
