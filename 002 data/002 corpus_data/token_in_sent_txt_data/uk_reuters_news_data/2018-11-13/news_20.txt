feature-fuel shortages the new normal in venezuela as oil industry unravels
reuters with chronic shortages of basic goods afflicting her native venezuela veronica perez used to drive from supermarket to supermarket in her gray chevrolet aveo searching for food
but the engineer has abandoned the practice because of shortages of something that should be abundant in a country with the world s largest oil reserves gasoline
i only do what is absolutely necessary nothing else said perez who lives in the industrial city of valencia
she said she had stopped going to venezuela s caribbean coast just miles km away
snaking lines and gas station closures have long afflicted venezuela s border regions
fuel smuggling to neighboring countries is common the result of generous subsidies from oil company pdvsa that allow venezuelans to fill their tank times for the price of one kilo pounds of cheese
but in late october and early november cities in the populous central region of the country like valencia and the capital caracas were hit by a rare wave of shortages due to plunging crude production and a dramatic drop in refineries fuel output as the economy suffers its fifth year of recession
venezuela produced more than million barrels per day bpd of crude last year but by september output had fallen to just million bpd
so far in venezuela produced an average of million bpd the lowest in nearly seven decades according to figures reported to opec
bottlenecks for transporting fuel from refineries distribution centers and ports to gas stations have also worsened exacerbating the shortages
pdvsa did not respond to a request for comment
neither did venezuela s oil and communications ministries
relatively normal supply has since been restored in caracas and valencia after unusually long outages but the episode has forced venezuelans to alter their daily habits
that could hit an economy seen shrinking by double digits in
for venezuelans coping with a lack of food and medicine blackouts and hyperinflation the gasoline shortages could also increase frustration with president nicolas maduro
my new headache is fearing i might run out of gasoline said elena bustamante a english teacher in valencia
it has changed my life venezuela s economy has shrunk by more than half since maduro took office in
the contraction has been driven by a collapse in the price of crude and falling oil sales which account for more than percent of venezuelan exports
three million venezuelans have emigrated or around of the population mostly in the past three years according to the united nations
despite a sharp drop in domestic demand due to the recession venezuela s collapsing oil industry is struggling to produce enough gasoline
fuel demand was expected to fall to bpd in october half the volume of a decade ago but pdvsa expected to be able to supply only bpd according to a company planning document seen by reuters
a gasoline price hike promised by maduro in august under a reform package could further reduce demand but it has yet to take effect
venezuela s declining oil production has its roots in years of underinvestment
sanctions have complicated financing
the refining sector designed to produce million bpd of fuel is severely hobbled
it is operating at just of capacity according to experts and union sources
its largest refinery amuay is delivering just bpd of gasoline despite having the capacity to produce bpd of fuel according to union leader ivan freites and another person close to pdvsa who spoke on the condition of anonymity
pdvsa has tried to make up for this by boosting fuel imports buying about half of the gasoline the country needs according to internal company figures
in the first eight months of venezuela imported an average of bpd from the united states up percent from the same period a year earlier data from the energy information administration show
but delays in unloading fuel cargoes have contributed to shortages since venezuelan oil ports are more oriented toward exports than imports according to traders shippers pdvsa sources and refinitiv eikon data
one tanker bringing imported gasoline mixed with ethanol was contaminated with high levels of water forcing pdvsa to withdraw the product from distribution centers a company source said directly contributing to the shortages in caracas
the incident was the result of pdvsa seeking fuel from unreliable suppliers in part because the sanctions have left many companies unwilling to do business with venezuela said the source who spoke on the condition of anonymity
the shortages last week prevented andres merida a freelance publicist in valencia from attending client meetings
i had someone who used to take me from place to place but in light of the gasoline issue he would not give me a lift even when i offered to pay him he said
he said he would prefer to save the gasoline and guarantee it for additional reporting by anggy polanco in san cristobal mircely guanipa in punto fijo vivian sequera in carcas and marianna parraga in mexico city writing by luc cohen editing by daniel flynn and chris reese
