china lng growth not slowing, says woodside ceo
melbourne nov reuters china s appetite for liquefied natural gas lng has not slowed but its purchases have been spread more evenly avoiding last year s sudden spike to meet winter demand australia s top independent lng producer said on tuesday
lng demand from north asia s main hubs in japan china and south korea has slowed in recent weeks raising concern that forecasts for a milder than usual winter may dent consumption
there are also signs that the ongoing trade war is starting to dent industry in china
we re not seeing a slowdown woodside petroleum chief executive peter coleman said
china learned from last year from the last winter that the peakiness in demand in the market really distorted the market
it distorted prices and it meant they were not able to get gas to consumers in china during the peak of he said china has flattened that demand by buying across the year while the volume overall has grown
so the total is increasing but the peakiness has gone out of it coleman told reporters after speaking at the melbourne mining club
woodside sells most of its lng to customers in japan and south korea but has a with privately owned enn group to boost sales in china
coleman said chinese demand for cargoes for delivery in february would be the real measure of how prepared the system is for winter
those cargoes would need to be bought in december
so in december we ll start to see how people feel they re positioned he said
energy consultants wood mackenzie expects china s lng demand to be million tonnes this winter season which runs from to up percent from last winter
coleman said in the there had been no impact from the trade war with china as lng cargoes were making bigger margins flowing into europe instead of asia at the moment
longer term the trade war may delay final investment decisions for some new lng projects in the united states especially those being built by smaller companies which need buyers to underpin long term contracts
you re not seeing the chinese buyer in that particular market at the moment coleman said
lng ltd last month said it was delaying a final decision on whether to build its magnolia lng plant in louisiana citing difficulty in lining up chinese customers due to the trade war
