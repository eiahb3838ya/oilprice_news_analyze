update 3-risking trump ire, opec builds case for oil supply cut
london reuters opec built a case on tuesday for cutting oil output when it meets next month warning that a supply glut could emerge in as the world economy slows and rivals increase production more quickly than expected
worried by a drop in oil prices and rising supplies opec is talking again of reducing production just months after increasing it
such a shift would anger president donald trump who on monday urged opec not to cut supply
in a monthly report the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said world oil demand next year would rise by million barrels per day bpd less than predicted last month and the fourth consecutive reduction in its forecast
oil prices have dropped steeply from a high above a barrel in october pressured by concern that global demand is weakening amid adequate supply offsetting sanctions on iran that have started to cut the opec country s oil exports
although the oil market has reached a balance now the forecasts for for supply growth indicate higher volumes outpacing the expansion in world oil demand leading to widening excess supply in the market opec said in the report
the recent downward revision to the global economic growth forecast and associated uncertainties confirm the emerging pressure on oil demand observed in recent crude extended an earlier decline after the release of the opec report trading as low as a barrel the lowest since march
together with russia and other allies opec had agreed in june to boost supply after pressure from trump to lower prices
the move partially unwound output cuts that began in january in an effort to clear a glut that formed in
the group meets on to set policy for
in the report opec said its oil output rose further in october by bpd to million bpd after the june deal
the biggest rises came from the united arab emirates and top exporter saudi arabia
these helped offset declines in venezuela where economic crisis has curbed output and iran as buyers walked away before sanctions started this month
the october production rate is considerably more than opec expects consumers will require next year
opec said the world would need million bpd from its members in down bpd from last month
this suggests there will be a million bpd surplus in the market should opec keep pumping the same amount and other things remain equal
saudi energy minister khalid on monday had outlined a case for supply restraint saying opec and its allies agreed that analysis showed a need to cut output next year by around million bpd from october levels
oil demand is slowing as the world economy decelerates opec nudged down its growth forecast in the report
the recovery in oil prices that followed the supply cut is still prompting more growth in rival production
supply will rise in by million bpd the organisation said bpd more than previously thought and far more than the increase in world demand
