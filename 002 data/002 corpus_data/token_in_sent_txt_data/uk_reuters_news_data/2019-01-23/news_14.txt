explainer-the cash crunch behind zimbabwe's violent protests
harare jan reuters zimbabwe s president emmerson mnangagwa has promised action in response to a crackdown by security forces on protesters following a hike in the price of fuel
lawyers and activists say police and soldiers have killed at least a dozen people wounded scores and arrested hundreds over the demonstrations
zimbabwe s human rights commission zhrc accused security forces of systematic torture
critics say the country is reverting to the authoritarian rule that characterised the regime of former leader robert mugabe who was forced from power after a coup in november
the crisis will not be easy to fix
there is a severe shortage of dollars fuel and medicines while inflation hit percent in december the highest in a decade
foreign investors are by and large staying away
everyday life has been getting harder as the price of basic goods spirals
in the past two months the country has suffered acute shortages of imported goods including medicines food and fuel
motorists can wait for hours to fill up at fuel stations where soldiers are often deployed to break up fights over who is next in line
on mnangagwa announced to reporters that the price of petrol had increased to per litre from from midnight but there would be no increase for foreign embassies and tourists paying in cash dollars
it was the final straw for some zimbabweans and violent protests broke out two days after his announcement
some residents say that while calm has returned soldiers have continued to beat up civilians
many people blame mnangagwa for failing to fulfil his promises to economic growth and make a clean break with the rule of his predecessor
the country abandoned the zimbabwe dollar in after inflation reached billion percent the year before
in its place the government adopted the dollar and other currencies including sterling and the south african rand
people hoped the move would spell the end of spiralling prices and rampant money printing that made much of their earnings and savings virtually worthless
but over time supply of the and south african currencies dried up so in november authorities in harare launched a surrogate currency paper bond notes designed to ease acute hard currency shortages
the notes which now have a total face value of million are backed by a million loan from the african export and import bank the central bank has said
they are used like cash
officially pegged to the dollar at a rate of on the street fetches up to bond notes reflecting the ongoing shortage of dollars and people s desire to trade out of cheapening bond notes and into more reliable currency
a dwindling supply of bond notes and coins has led to banks limiting daily withdrawals to as little as in bond notes
companies are struggling to pay for imports and foreign investors can not repatriate dividends or profits
when the bond note was introduced dollar deposits in the electronic banking system started losing their value
government borrowing via treasury bills meant authorities were creating money without the backing of sufficient currency reserves or gold
it is these electronic dollars theoretically worth billion and nicknamed zollars by economists that are raising fears that zimbabwe might be heading for its second financial collapse in a decade
zimbabweans can do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with cash prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for hard currency which can be deposited and used to make payments
zollars remain officially pegged at to the dollar but on the black market is now worth zollars
that has led some businesses to offer discounts on dollar payments
zimbabwe s foreign reserves now provide less than two weeks cover for imports central bank data show
the government has said it would only consider launching a new currency if it had at least six months of reserves
but finance minister mthuli ncube said zimbabwe planned to introduce a new currency in the next months
companies are struggling to import raw materials and equipment forcing them to buy dollars on the black market
civil servants are paid in zollars like many other workers across the country
only a small minority of employees working for foreign embassies charities or large international corporations are paid in dollars
last october the central bank ordered banks to create separate dollar accounts for clients who are paid from overseas which analysts said was a tacit admission by authorities that the greenback was not equal to the zollar
the confederation of zimbabwe industries has warned that some of its members could stop operating by the end of the month due to the dollar crunch
the group said its members had a backlog of million in unpaid payments to foreign suppliers
cooking oil and soap maker olivine industries said on saturday it had suspended production and put workers on indefinite leave because it owed foreign suppliers million
zimbabwe s largest brewing company delta beverages by inbev said it had abandoned a plan to only accept hard currency payments rather than zollars for its beer and soft drinks after the government intervened
mnangagwa a former spy chief installed after mugabe s removal in a coup in november was elected in july amid hopes that he would help secure an economic turnaround for zimbabwe and has said his nation is open for business
but critics say the man nicknamed the crocodile is moving too slowly on economic and political reforms including repealing laws that restrict the media
mnangagwa has also called for the lifting of sanctions against officials from the ruling party top military figures and some firms which were imposed during mugabe s rule for what washington called violations of human rights and democracy
the imf has said it would be difficult for the fund to support the country s reform programme unless its billion arrears with the world bank african development bank and european investment bank are paid
harare says that should be done in the next months and plans a programme allowing the imf to monitor its economic reforms although it does not entail funding from the lender
analysts said the ongoing security crackdown could quell the protests for now but more clashes were expected unless mnangagwa s administration could find a solution to the cash shortages
