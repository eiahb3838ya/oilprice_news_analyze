update 2-rwe shares up on hopes for higher coal exit compensation
berlin reuters shares in rwe germany s largest power producer rose almost percent on wednesday at the prospect of higher compensation should power stations be shut down early
a draft paper by germany s coal commission which is tasked with organising the exit from coal showed operators of power stations should receive compensation for early closure but did not specify the size of payments
a shut down date is due to be settled on friday
the draft document seen by reuters said a mutual agreement between the government and the plant operators including rwe and uniper was the preferred option
the commission assumes that in the negotiations with the operators of power plants the entire planning period up to will be settled by mutual agreement the draft said
if such an agreement can not be reached by june the commission will recommend a regulatory solution including compensation payments based on legal requirements it said
while no figures are mentioned the commission suggests that the compensation for operators should be based on payments made for similar cases in the past
utilities have already received around million euros million per gigawatt to idle plants and put them into a strategic reserve
if true this would imply much more meaningful compensation for rwe than we currently assume jefferies analysts wrote in a note following the reuters report
shares in rwe were the highest gainer on germany s index
shares in uniper gained only percent however
the commission consisting of politicians researchers and lobbyists is expected to adopt a more detailed version of the paper on friday
according to the draft fees for the use of electricity grids should be reduced for both industry and private consumers and operators of power stations should receive compensation for early closure
the necessary funds must be made available by the state to finance the recommended measures
there will be no surcharge on electricity prices the paper says
the entire is to be reviewed again in and with a view to security of supply prices climate protection and structural change
