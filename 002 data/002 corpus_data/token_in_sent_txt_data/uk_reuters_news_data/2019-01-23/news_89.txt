the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london jan reuters crude oil production will continue to grow through and but at a much slower pace than in according to the latest forecasts from the energy information administration
crude and condensates production is estimated to have risen by almost million barrels per day last year according to the agency the largest annual increase in history
but the agency forecasts growth will slow to just over million barrels per day in and less than million bpd in energy outlook eia
growth from the lower states excluding federal waters in the gulf of mexico is expected to slow even more sharply from almost million bpd in to million bpd in and million bpd in
surging production mostly from onshore shale plays contributed to the oversupply which emerged in the oil market during and the consequent fall in prices during the fourth quarter
slower growth from the shale plays will therefore have to play an important role in rebalancing the market during and even if the global economy avoids a recession
the dramatic fall in oil prices in the fourth quarter was largely driven by shale production surprising to the upside as a result of the surge in activity earlier in the year oilfield services firm schlumberger told investors last week
the shale surge combined with generous waivers from sanctions on iran s oil exports and the sharp fall in global equity markets created a near perfect storm to close out according to schlumberger
but the company sees a more balanced market ahead as sanctions waivers are not renewed the united states and china resolve their trade differences and lower drilling activity in the second half of impacts production growth schlumberger announces and results schlumberger
benchmark crude futures peaked at around per barrel in early october and are now trading at less than the largest decline since the slump in
crude futures have fallen to a substantial discount to brent and many shale producers are receiving even less highlighting the extent of the local oversupply
lower crude prices are already helping readjust the market by tempering the onshore drilling and fracking frenzy compared with earlier last year drilling productivity report eia
well completions steadied between march and november after strong growth since as some producers postponed fracking and completing wells owing to disappointing wellhead prices
more recently the rising number of drilled but uncompleted wells ducs has prompted producers to scale back drilling programmes to avoid an even bigger increase in inventory
the number of drilling rigs targeting predominantly formations has fallen in each of the first three weeks of
active rigs have fallen by from a cyclical high of in to just in the third week of january
last week the active rig count fell by the largest decline since february when oil prices were still close to the last cyclical trough
oil prices usually have a lagged effect on production owing to the time taken to contract rigs move them to the site and rig them up bore the well contract a completion crew frack install surface gear and hook the well up to gathering pipelines
experience suggests changes in oil prices tend to filter through to changes in reported production with an overall delay of months
recent production trends confirm this lag
there is a delay of roughly months from changes in prices to changes in drilling and another months to completion and initial flows
changes in prices tend to filter through to changes in the rig count with an average delay of weeks last week s sudden drop came weeks after oil prices peaked in early october
rapid output growth during was mostly the delayed impact of the sharp rise in prices in and the first nine months of
output is expected to continue growing during the first six months of as wells planned during the period of high prices and drilled in the final months of are completed and put into production
but the recent decline in prices and drilling if sustained will likely start to slow production growth during the second half of
