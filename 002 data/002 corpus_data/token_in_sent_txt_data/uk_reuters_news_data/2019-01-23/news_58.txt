refile-davos-russia says oil price war with u.s. would be too costly
davos switzerland reuters russia should not unleash an oil price war against the united states but rather stick with output cuts even at the cost of losing market share in the medium term one of the main russian architects of a production pact with opec said
since russia and opec have cut oil production jointly for the first time in an effort to boost the price of crude
following their supply pact oil has traded between roughly and per barrel from below before the deal took effect
for shale production to go down you need oil prices at per barrel and below
that is not healthy for the russian economy kirill dmitriev head of the russian direct investment fund said on wednesday
we should not take competitive action to destroy shale production said dmitriev speaking at the world economic forum in davos switzerland
three years ago in davos dmitriev became the first russian official to mention publicly the possibility of a supply pact with the organization of the petroleum exporting countries
at that time oil prices had collapsed after opec kingpin saudi arabia raised output to hurt producers
the rise in prices thanks to output cuts has brought roughly an additional billion in revenues to russia dmitriev said
however higher oil prices have also helped the united states which is not participating in output cuts
the country s production has rocketed overtaking that of russia and saudi arabia and making it the world s largest oil liquids producer
production is expected to reach new highs this year
russian president vladimir putin will visit saudi arabia later in to strengthen cooperation further dmitriev said
azerbaijan one of the largest former soviet oil producers and a participant in the production deal with opec believes the pact should be extended to the end of this year president ilham aliyev said this week
such a move should keep oil prices in the to range aliyev said
