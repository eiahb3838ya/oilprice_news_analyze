update 2-italy's salvini hopes macron's support dwindles at eu elections
rome reuters italian deputy prime minister matteo salvini said on wednesday he hoped the french people would not choose president emmanuel macron s party in european parliament elections later this year drawing a sharp response from officials in paris
relations between italy and france generally close allies have worsened since the league and movement formed a coalition government in italy last year and took aim at union macron s en marche on the move party
france has already summoned italy s ambassador this week after salvini s fellow deputy prime minister luigi di maio accused paris of creating poverty in africa and generating mass migration to europe
macron may no longer be our interlocutor in the future salvini said in an interview with italian radio rai
his support is less than percent
i hope the french people can shortly make different choices he said referring to may s european elections
salvini s comment triggered an angry reaction from france s foreign ministry
these unfounded statements should be read in the context of domestic italian politics
they are unacceptable foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes von der muhll said in a daily online briefing
italy s ambassador had been reminded of the boundaries that should be observed for relations to remain friendly and cooperative the spokeswoman added
on tuesday salvini said france was not interested in stabilising libya a staging point for smugglers who send migrants towards europe on unsafe boats because french energy interests there clash with italy s
salvini who is the leader of the league party also said he is not concerned about the effect the dispute will have on the government s effort to save troubled airline alitalia
italian newspapers have reported that the airline air is in talks with rome to take a stake in the carrier
there are other players in a position to take a share of alitalia s capital salvini said
