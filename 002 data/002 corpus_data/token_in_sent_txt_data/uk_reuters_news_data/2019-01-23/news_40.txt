root and branch reform: swedish scientist makes fuel from tree waste
lund sweden reuters might tree roots twigs and branches one day be used to power cars
that s what a swedish researcher is hoping after developing a pulp byproduct that on a modest scale does just that
chemical engineering scientist christian hulteberg from lund university has used the black liquor residue from pulp and paper manufacturing to create a polymer called lignin
after purification and filtration that is then turned into a gasoline mixture
we re actually using the stuff of the wood that they don t use when they make paper and pulp
it adds value to components of the tree he told reuters
in environmental terms he says that gives it an advantage over other biofuels such as ethanol
a lot of the controversy with ethanol production has been the use of feedstock that you can actually eat he said
hulteberg has a pilot plant in operation and hopes the forest fuel will be available in service stations by
though it will only serve a fraction of the demands of swedish motorists he is hopeful that along with other renewable products under development it could help wean us off our addiction to fossil fuels
