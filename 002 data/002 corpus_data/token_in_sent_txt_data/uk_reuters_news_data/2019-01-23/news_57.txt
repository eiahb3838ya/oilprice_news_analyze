i call on all of you to rebuild trust toward the system for international trade
that should be a system that is fair transparent and effective in protecting intellectual property rights and also in such areas as and government abe said japan hoped to work with the united states and europe to reform world trade organization wto rules so they adopt to a rapidly changing environment for global trade
we have to make the wto a more credible presence
we have to make reforms to make it more credible
japan would like to play a leading role in wto reforms he said
the wto has been paralyzed as the united states unhappy with what it says is the wto s failure to hold beijing to account for not opening up its economy has blocked new appointments to the world s top trade court
rapidly running out of judges some analysts say the wto will be unable to issue binding rulings in trade disputes

japan has to be consistent on the need to promote free trade and shouldn t change this stance even if the united states is always talking about doing a bilateral deal said takeshi niinami head of brewer suntory holdings ltd and an economic adviser to abe
australia singapore and other partnership tpp countries could help japan make free trade a key topic of debate at the he told reuters
at his previous davos visit in abe pledged to pull the economy out of stagnation with his abenomics mix of fiscal spending monetary policy and steps to boost japan s potential growth via labor market reform and deregulation
five years later the boost to growth from abenomics is fading inflation remains far below the bank of japan s target and critics point to a lack of progress on deregulation
abe sought to counter such criticism saying that japan s economic fundamentals were very solid and he also reiterated his resolve to proceed with a scheduled rise in the rate of consumption tax in october
aside from trade abe said japan hoped to build a consensus on the need to reduce plastic waste flowing into the oceans and coordinate on global usage of digital data without infringing on personal privacy and intellectual property
decarbonisation and profit making can happen in tandem
we policy makers must be held responsible to make it happen as i will be stressing in osaka this year he said
people close to the premier have said abe is keen to use the summit in osaka western japan in june to boost his poll ratings ahead of an upper house election looming
