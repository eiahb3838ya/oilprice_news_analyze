eu's barnier says no-deal brexit is default scenario
brussels jan reuters european union s brexit negotiator michel barnier said on wednesday that brexit was the default scenario and the fact that majority of the house of commons was against it would not prevent it from happening
preparing for a scenario is more important now than ever even though i still hope that we can avoid this scenario barnier told a gathering of employers and labour organisations in brussels
today there are two possible ways to leave the eu number one an orderly withdrawal based on the agreement that we have built step by step with the uk over the last months number two a disorderly withdrawal leaving the eu without a deal is a default scenario and there appears to be a majority in the house of commons to oppose a
but opposing will not stop from happening he said adding it would be necessary for the british to find a majority in favour of another solution to a disorderly exit
he spoke in english rather than his native french something he tends to do when he wants policymakers in britain to take particular note of his remarks
