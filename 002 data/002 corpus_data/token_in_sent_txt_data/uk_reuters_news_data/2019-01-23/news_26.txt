graphic-u.s. sanctions on venezuela would reroute crude, leave refiners short
jan reuters potential sanctions on venezuela s crude oil exports would cut off the nation from gulf coast refiners that are among its biggest customers likely forcing it to send more crude to china india or other asian countries traders said on wednesday
refineries that depend on venezuela s heavy crude would have even more trouble securing supplies as canadian and mexican crudes are often not as discounted and are limited in availability
the united states is considering moves to cripple venezuela s oil shipments which account for nearly all of the country s exports in response to the reelection of president nicolas maduro that was widely viewed as a sham
washington has recognized opposition leader juan guaido as venezuela s president as protests against maduro erupt across the country
it is also considering sanctions on oil deliveries a move it has until now resisted energy company sources told reuters on wednesday

venezuela s output has been cut in half since to less than million bpd according to figures from opec secondary sources
in the wake of sanctions the country could seek additional deals with turkey india or other asian nations one trader of venezuelan crude said
it will be costly for venezuela but eventually they ll be able to sell that oil to asia at a discount
there will be a period in the middle in which they have difficulty selling those barrels said francisco monaldi fellow in latin american energy policy at the baker institute for public policy at rice university in houston

prices of heavier grades like mars sour an offshore medium crude and heavy louisiana sweet crude have risen as buyers scramble for supply
mars traded at a premium to crude on tuesday a high according to refinitiv eikon data
