dealtalk-despite 60 pct support, canada's husky scrapped meg oil merger
manitoba reuters when the final numbers were tallied late last wednesday for husky energy s hostile bid for rival canadian oil producer meg energy husky s top executives learned they had the support of nearly percent of meg shareholders people familiar with the situation told reuters
that meant they easily surpassed the percent threshold usually needed to extend their offer and reach the mark necessary to win the deal
on thursday morning however husky walked away saying it had insufficient support
the move shocked investors analysts and meg itself
it is usually a given that a company securing such significant backing would extend its bid buying extra time to drum up remaining support
however husky in a statement on thursday noted two negative developments since it made the offer in september a lack of progress expanding pipelines in western canada and the province of alberta s decision to order production cuts to drain a glut of oil in storage
the company has nothing further to add spokesman mel duvall said on tuesday
in fact the deal began losing its financial appeal shortly after husky made the offer people close to husky said
by last wednesday it seemed to one of the people as if husky was hoping the bid would fail
the economics of the transaction changed very materially since they launched the bid
it was an extremely shrewd move by husky to launch the hostile offer and just as smart to let it go said an energy m a lawyer who declined to be identified because of his ties to both companies
crude prices have dropped some percent since husky launched its bid
worse for canadian oil producers discounts on their crude reached levels less than two weeks later as pipeline congestion worsened
husky whose majority investor is hong kong tycoon li was largely immune because it owns refineries that can handle all of its own crude
but the industry s crisis pressured alberta premier rachel notley to order mandatory production cuts in early december over opposition from husky and a couple of other producers
husky displayed doubts as far back as november
that month according to meg it did not take up meg s offer of signing a confidentiality agreement to take a closer look at the target
curtailments quickly changed the economics boosting canadian prices and diluting a major advantage for husky
husky s upgrader and refineries previously insulated it nicely from deep price discounts and cheap crude fattened its margins downstream
husky s refining capacity exceeds its own heavy oil production and so in an market it bought cheap barrels from competitors with nowhere to move them driving up husky s margins said steve kallir senior analyst at wood mackenzie
but such trades became less profitable as canadian prices rose and the appeal of buying meg s oil production may have also diminished he said
early this month as the oil industry s ground shifted with alberta s curtailments husky chief executive rob peabody did not accept an invitation from meg ceo derek evans to negotiate a friendly agreement according to meg
but husky s change of heart on shifting price dynamics does not satisfy everyone
meg s assets will endure for decades making thinking less relevant said eric nuttall senior portfolio manager of ninepoint partners a meg shareholder
