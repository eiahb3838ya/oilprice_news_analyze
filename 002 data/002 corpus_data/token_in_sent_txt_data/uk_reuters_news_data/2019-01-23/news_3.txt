exclusive-petrobras rejects latest eig-backed bid for oilfields - sources
rio de janeiro reuters petroleo brasileiro sa has rejected the most recent bid by an eig global energy firm to purchase a pair of oil clusters two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said potentially derailing a major divestment late in the process
ouro preto oleo e gas a brazilian energy firm backed by private equity firm eig entered exclusive talks in july with petrobras as the oil firm is known to purchase its pampo and enchova clusters
at the time the fields located in the campos basin off the coast of rio de janeiro were seen fetching around billion
petrobras is cutting stakes in fields to focus on brazil s larger deepwater play
that is creating an opportunity for smaller oil companies and private equity firms eager to extract value from relatively mature assets
but the process has been rocky at times
for petrobras the collapse or delay of the pampo and enchova deal could hurt its bid to meet an ambitious divestment target of billion over five years
with combined oil production of about barrels per day pampo and enchova is the largest mature production asset currently in petrobras divestment portfolio
in december petrobras reopened bidding for the clusters as brazil s federal audit court known as the tcu requires for most petrobras divestitures
under the final rebidding round investors can submit bids of varying values so long as they have the same contractual terms as the winning bid in the original round
ouro preto took advantage of the rebidding process to cut its offer due in part to a drop in oil prices reuters reported in december
however petrobras unhappy with ouro preto s price cut has rejected the consortium s updated bid according to the sources who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters
eig and ouro preto declined to comment
petrobras did not respond to a request for comment
the setback underlines the slow at times convoluted process surrounding petrobras divestments which have often frustrated potential buyers
the next steps in the pampo and enchova divestiture are unclear
one of the sources said the ouro preto consortium may try to come back to the table to resume bilateral negotiations with petrobras
should petrobras the process to other potential buyers or open a fresh bidding round it could create an opportunity for firms like trident energy backed by private equity firm warburg pincus which had submitted an offer for pampo and enchova during the original bidding round in
trident did not respond to a request for comment
