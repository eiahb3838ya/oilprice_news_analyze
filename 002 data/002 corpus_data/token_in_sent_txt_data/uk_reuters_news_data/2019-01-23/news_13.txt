graphic-opec cuts, outages give physical crude a new year lift
london reuters crude oil markets in europe and west africa have made a strong start to as libyan supply losses and strong demand in asia offset rising exports
nigeria s biggest crude grade qua iboe was being offered this week at a a barrel premium to benchmark dated brent a high
in the north sea forties crude reached its highest since october on monday
the strength comes as global oil producers led by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries are embarking on supply curbs to boost prices and due to other involuntary supply losses such as libyan outages and sanctions on iran
we would expect some more support to be coming through for physical crude right now said david reid an analyst at jbc energy in vienna
this is because we see a deficit in the crude balance from a trading perspective which is quite pronounced this in other signs of strength russian urals crude in the baltic has risen to its highest in five years predominantly driven by a shortage of similar medium sour crudes
the rally was not expected by some in the market
i am quite surprised said a trader focusing on north sea crude
i thought there would be more pressure on the market given the extra barrels that are coming over
but there is huge demand in the far east and outages in the united states not part of the pact is sending more oil abroad and in late november exported more crude and fuel than it imported for the first time on record
nonetheless losses of crude from libya s largest oilfield similar in quality to nigerian and north sea grades have offset this
el sharara which produces barrels per day was taken over on by groups of tribesmen armed protesters and state guards and traders say it remains shut
libya is not the only place where supply is falling short
lower supply of algerian saharan blend as well as a smaller export schedule for kazakhstan s cpc blend has drawn a number of nigerian cargoes to northwest europe
there as well as the gains seen in forties and the other four crudes that underpin dated brent traders say the less visible north sea crudes are already sold out for next month reflecting a tighter market
indicating the same brent crude futures for immediate delivery are trading at a premium to the second month as are the brent swaps called contracts for differences cfds used to price dated brent the benchmark used around the world for physical oil trades
this structure called backwardation is a sign of tight supply boosting the value of oil for delivery soon
but the rest of the brent futures curve to is in the opposite structure contango suggesting ample supply
some traders do not expect the strength to last saying supply in the west african market is not tight
not all west african crude differentials have risen those for heavier angolan grades are down jbc s reid said adding that poor refinery profit margins in a number of regions were a downside risk
in addition this kind of market structure in the cfds can act as a sword traders say
having oil sitting idle on a tanker for the journey from west africa or from the north sea to the heart of the chinese teapot industry in shandong becomes expensive when the market is in backwardation
the irony is with backwardation now creeping into the cfds my guess is we won t see any further price rises another trader said
it takes value out of pricing even so sellers are enjoying the moment
qua iboe is being offered as high as dated brent plus by some cargo owners
a trade at that level would be the highest since according to refinitiv eikon data
sellers are very bullish a third trader said
