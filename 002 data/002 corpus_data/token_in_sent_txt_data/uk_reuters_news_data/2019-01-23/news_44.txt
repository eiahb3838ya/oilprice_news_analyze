update 1-eurosceptic rees-mogg hopeful of changes to uk pm may's brexit deal
adds comments on suspending parliament london jan reuters british prime minister theresa may s brexit deal could be reformed to make it acceptable to leave lawmakers in her party who object to proposals on the irish border prominent eurosceptic lawmaker jacob said on wednesday
who chairs the european research group erg was among conservative lawmakers who voted against may s deal when it was overwhelmingly defeated last week but he said he was more optimistic that changes might be made to the deal that could see it approved by parliament
i think at last things are going our way
i think there is good news for us to hope that a reformation of this deal could be achieved that could make it acceptable he added at a event
but it is not there yet and until it is people like me will vote against the said changes to the deal would have to have equal legal status to the deal itself and that the backstop must be somehow removed or nullified to win his vote something the eu has repeatedly said it is unwilling to consider
if may is able to achieve that and win the support of the erg head it could be enough to persuade large numbers of other eurosceptics to vote for may s amended deal and unlock the stymied brexit process
said attempts under way in parliament to take the exit process out of may s hands and delay leaving the eu were a threat to the british constitution and urged the government to do what ever it took to block them including suspending parliament if necessary
if the house of commons undermines our basic constitutional conventions then the executive is entitled to use other vestigial constitutional means to stop it by which i basically mean prorogation he said referring to the formal closure of parliament
