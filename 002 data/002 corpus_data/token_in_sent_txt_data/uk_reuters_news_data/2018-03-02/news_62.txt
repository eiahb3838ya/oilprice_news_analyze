u.s. epa proposes changes to coal ash regulations
washington reuters the environmental protection agency on thursday proposed changes to rules regulating coal ash waste from power plants that it said would give states more flexibility over its disposal and save electric utilities up to million a year in compliance costs
the proposal includes more than a dozen changes to an rule that established minimum national standards for the disposal of coal ash a byproduct of power plants that contains toxic materials such as arsenic and lead
today s coal ash proposal embodies epa s commitment to our state partners by providing them with the ability to incorporate flexibilities into their coal ash permit programs based on the needs of their states epa administrator scott pruitt said in a statement
in september the epa said it would reconsider the rule after utility industry groups petitioned for changes
environmental groups warned in september that if the epa rolled back the safeguards it would put the public at risk because coal ash pits are located near waterways and groundwater
the agency said it would be accepting public comment on the proposal for days and planned to hold a public hearing
