bulgarian lawmakers demand decision on fate of nuclear plant by end of june
sofia march reuters the energy ministry should draw up proposals by the end of june on whether to proceed with or scrap plans for bulgaria s belene nuclear power project parliament decided on friday
the black sea state initially cancelled the project in after failing to find foreign investors and bowing to and european union pressure to limit the country s energy dependence on russia which would have supplied some equipment
but the current government renewed the search for private investors to build the plant on the danube river after an arbitration court ruled in that bulgaria had to pay more than million euros million in compensation to russian state nuclear company rosatom due to the cancellation
the plant would be bulgaria s second nuclear power station after the kozloduy power plant also on the danube river
the chairman of parliament s energy commission delyan dobrev said friday s demand by lawmakers for the energy ministry to make a decision about the project s fate does not exclude any option for the bulgaria has spent more than billion levs billion on the project so far dobrev said adding that lawmakers wanted clarity on what would now happen to those assets
today we do not make a decision to build or not to build the belene nuclear power plant we do not make a decision to have additional nuclear power or not he said
lawmakers from the ruling gerb party said any potential investors in future should be willing to build the plant without state guarantees and without power purchase agreements
bulgaria s socialists the largest opposition party and attack part of the united patriots grouping that is a junior partner in the ruling coalition are among those calling for the project to be restarted
but several economists say bulgaria does not need belene saying the cost of building it outweighs the benefits
they say such a large project offered potential for corruption a problem they say is widespread in the balkan nation
prosecutors have charged three former energy ministers over mismanagement linked to the project
