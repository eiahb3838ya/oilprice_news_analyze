philippines earmarks two sites for possible joint oil exploration with china
manila march reuters the philippines on friday identified two areas in south china sea where joint exploration for oil and gas may be undertaken with china including one in territory that both sides have argued over for years
the two countries have agreed to set up a special panel to work out how they can jointly explore in part of the hotly contested waters without having to address the issue of sovereignty something experts say would be extremely complex
philippine president rodrigo duterte s spokesman harry roque said the areas being considered were sites covered by service contracts and which are exploration permits issued by manila s energy ministry
what i know is that there are two areas being considered for joint exploration but both are within the exclusive economic zone of the philippines roque told reporters
china claims almost the entire south china sea believed to rich in energy reserves and marine resources
brunei malaysia vietnam and taiwan also have claims
the at the reed bank a disputed area is where pxp energy corp had been undertaking exploration to evaluate the block s gas reserves
in the philippines won a case at the permanent court of arbitration in the hague which invalidated china s claim to sovereignty over most of the south china sea and also made clear the reed bank was inside the philippines exclusive economic zone eez
china does not recognise the ruling
since reed bank is disputed roque said there must be an agreement before the two countries can proceed with the joint exploration
the philippine energy ministry suspended exploration in the reed bank known locally as recto bank in late as the government pursued the arbitration case disrupting pxp energy s plan to drill two wells
chinese boats had in harassed a survey ship contracted by pxp s unit forum energy
pxp is eager to resume exploration in the reed bank but said any joint venture would likely involve a chinese company
pxp had been talking with china national offshore oil corp cnooc about reed bank during the administration of duterte s predecessor benigno aquino but the arbitration disrupted negotiations
in september last year the philippines said it was pursuing a oil and gas exploration project with cnooc and a company in the area which is outside disputed waters
the area lies near the country s main oil and gas fields including malampaya nido cadlao and matinloc
