exxonmobil corp has declared force majeure on exports from its papua new guinea lng project which has been shut since a powerful earthquake on monday an industry source familiar with the matter said on friday
a company declares a force majeure when it is unable to carry out a contract because of forces beyond its control
exxon declined to comment on the force majeure
as a result asian spot lng prices jumped by percent since last week to per million british thermal units mmbtu
exxon is having trouble gauging the extent of the earthquake s damage given the remoteness of the gas field in the mountainous jungles of papua new guinea km miles from the export terminal
it is difficult to assess the duration of production outages but in our view given the location and magnitude of the earthquake as well as the scale of the aftershocks we anticipate at least a month s downtime is likely ubs bank said in an investor note on the earthquake s likely impact on the lng sector
the outage has left several north asian buyers seeking replacement cargoes in the spot market leading to a further rise in market activity which already hit records in january
several importers for china as well as taiwan s cpc corp are seeking to replace disrupted contracted supplies from papua with delivery cargoes from the spot market said three traders that participate in the market
other traders said on friday the seasonal in demand in north asia which includes japan china and south korea the world s top three buyers as winter ends and temperatures rise prevented a bigger price rise
spot lng prices for may were already lower than april s at around per mmbtu the traders said
the market situation has also been eased by increasing supplies from malaysia s bintulu lng export facility which had seen disruptions in recent weeks said two traders with knowledge of the matter
while the winter in north asia is showing signs of tapering off most of europe has been caught by a wave of extreme cold late in the season which pushed up british spot natural gas prices to record highs of pence per therm on march the equivalent of over per mmbtu and up percent from the last close in february and up percent since the end of december
the spike was a result of extreme cold across western europe caused by unusual siberian winds which the media has dubbed the beast from the east and which caused a surge in gas demand for heating as temperatures plummeted
european importers were vying with bids from asia for spot lng cargoes from qatar and the united states traders said
with warmer weather approaching in most of europe traders said the supply squeeze would likely ease into next week
weather data in thomson reuters eikon showed temperatures across most of western europe will likely rise towards the seasonal norm of around degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit within a week
