protests planned against opening of mega dam in northeastern india
bangkok march thomson reuters foundation villagers in northeastern india are threatening to disrupt the inauguration of a mega dam that has uprooted them from their traditional lands campaigners said on friday
resistance to the dam is seen as part of a growing movement across the country against large infrastructure projects which activists say do not benefit the very people forced to give up their land
officials said the mapithel dam in manipur state is due to be opened on march nearly years since construction began and that it will vastly increase access to drinking water irrigation and electricity
but those benefits won t even go to the affected communities who sacrificed their land river forest and resources said activist jajo themson
more protests are planned he said adding that previous demonstrations were put down with violence in a state where armed forces have special privileges to tackle a insurgency
pritam singh chief engineer of manipur s irrigation and flood control department denied the use of force against lawful protests
all necessary permissions for the dam were obtained and adequate compensation was given to those affected said singh
some people did not take the compensation but that is a different matter
rehabilitation of five of the six affected villages has been completed he told the thomson reuters foundation
almost hectares of land of which a third is forest have been flooded said jiten yumnam of the centre for research and advocacy manipur an indigenous rights organisation
about people in half a dozen villages are directly affected with buildings and fields inundated by rising waters he said
as the thoubal river dried up thousands more lost their livelihoods including fishing and collecting and selling sandstone that used to be washed downstream according to yumnam
the dam has an annual irrigation potential of about hectares and will increase the drinking water supply to the state capital imphal and surrounding areas by more than million litres a day according to a government audit
the project will generate megawatts for rural electrification
yumnam said authorities did not assess the dam s impact on the environment and residents who he said were not consulted
we should not proceed with this until we can be sure of its impact he said
he added that a petition against the dam is still pending before the national green tribunal a government body that deals with conservation cases
of nearly ongoing conflicts over land affecting nearly eight million people in india more than a fifth relate to infrastructure projects according to land conflict watch an indian research organisation
at least a dozen conflicts relate to hydroelectric dam projects its data showed
