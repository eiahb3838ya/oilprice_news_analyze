focus-how shell hid a whale before placing mexican oil bet
reuters the gasps in the audience were clearly audible at the auction of mexico s oil blocks a month ago as royal dutch shell s hefty bids were announced one by one
the size of shell s cash payments million out of the total of million that mexico earned in the sale far outstripped its competitors offers guaranteeing that the company swept up nine of the offshore blocks
the major knew something no one else did
six months earlier its drilling rig had struck a giant oil reservoir the whale well in the side of the gulf of mexico just across the border from many of the mexican blocks which share a similar geology
calculating that this significantly increased the chances of the mexican blocks also containing treasure shell delayed the announcement of the discovery until the day of the auction after bids had been submitted
post the whale discovery we had some geological insights
it is not by accident we didn t announce it until the day of the bid andy brown shell s head of oil and gas production told reuters
the nine blocks give us significant the geological intelligence gleaned from the whale discovery explains why shell bid so aggressively for the mexican blocks something that had confounded industry experts
it could also offer insight into the rationale underpinning its bet that latin america particularly mexico and brazil will be a major source of new reserves as its current resources dwindle
shell or any other explorer is not legally obliged to publicly disclose a discovery
the fact that its first major exploration success in over years came adjacent to blocks coming up for auction was a matter of good fortune while the timing of the announcement was canny
shell has not yet released any estimates for the whale s recoverable resources but two industry sources close to the exploration project put the figure at up to million barrels of oil
that equates to about half of shell s oil production and would make the reservoir one of the biggest discoveries of the past decade in the industry
shell declined to comment on the potential size of the reserves
fossil fuels like oil are formed over millions of years in specific rock formations which geologists and explorers try to identify via seismic studies and drilling to predict where resources might be found
but even though a similar geology might increase the chances of similar exploration success there are no guarantees and luck is always a big factor
so there is no certainty that the mexican blocks will yield commercial volumes of oil
for a graphic on shell oil and gas reserves click shell acquired large amounts of specialized seismic data before the auction about whale and the mexican blocks to try to gain a better sense of the geological formations and potential oil reserves under the seabed according to a source at an oil services company that provides such information
even for us it was surprising the way shell bid during mexico s deepwater auction
they really wanted the blocks close to the border which indicates there must be a link between the formation in the and in mexico the source added
shell needs to replenish its oil and gas reserves to maintain its production into the
aside from the billion acquisition of bg group in which boosted its reserves the company has had limited success in recent years
last year it was able to replace only percent of its production while on a average the figure was percent the company disclosed in its results
the decline in reserves means that at the end of shell had enough reserves to sustain its production for years compared with around years in
ceo ben van beurden while insisting he was not obsessed with the scale of his company s reserves said shell was starting to work on restocking its resources
we have a deepwater program that looks pretty good all the way into the next decade but if you look at the second half of the next decade you will need new elements in the development funnel to sustain the generation he told reporters after the annual results announcement last month
shell has now given itself seven years to replenish its exploration program in order to sustain its deepwater production growth well into the he added
the company like many of its peers was forced to dramatically slash spending in recent years because of weak oil prices with its exploration budgets hit particularly hard
now that prices have recovered to a near high of around a barrel firms feel more confident to once again invest in expensive offshore developments
shell owns a percent stake in the whale discovery with the remaining percent held by chevron which is mainly
the reservoir is located in the perdido area which has become a heartland of shell s deepwater activities in the gulf of mexico
companies such as shell that are eyeing mexico s offshore are hoping to use the vast infrastructure of pipelines and rigs on the side to reduce development costs said andrew latham of consultancy wood mackenzie
