update 1-at u.n., china delays u.s. bid to blacklist ships, companies over n.korea
united nations reuters china delayed a request for a united nations security council committee to blacklist ships shipping companies and a taiwan man for violating international sanctions on north korea diplomats said on friday
the united states submitted the request a week ago a move it says is aimed at shutting down north korea s illicit maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell the request coincided with the united states imposing its largest package of unilateral sanctions against north korea on friday intensifying pressure on pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and missile programmes
china did not give a reason for placing a hold on the request
a hold can be lifted and is often used when a security council member wants more information but sometimes it can lead to a permanent blocking of a proposed blacklisting
the security council north korea sanctions committee works on the basis of unanimity
if agreed the ships proposed by the united states of which are north korean vessels would be subjected to a global port entry ban
countries would also be required to deregister the ships that are not north korean
the proposed companies and the one individual would be subjected to an asset freeze
the security council has unanimously boosted sanctions on north korea since in a bid to choke off funding for pyongyang s nuclear and ballistic missile programs banning exports including coal iron lead textiles and seafood and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products
in october the united states proposed eight ships for designation for smuggling banned cargo from north korea
the committee agreed to ban four ships from ports globally while washington postponed a bid to blacklist the remaining four
in december the united states proposed ships for blacklisting the committee agreed to designate four while diplomats said china objected listing the remaining six
