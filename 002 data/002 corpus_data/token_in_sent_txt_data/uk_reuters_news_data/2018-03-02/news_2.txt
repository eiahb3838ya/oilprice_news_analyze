update 1-canada retaliation in u.s. tariff row 'like grabbing your own throat'
recasts adds industry analyst government comments by david ljunggren and leah schnurr mexico march reuters canadian officials are bombarding counterparts with calls to secure an exemption on potential steel and aluminium tariffs and threatening retaliation but ottawa has limited leverage to counter the plan industry insiders and analysts said on friday
simultaneously mulling retaliatory targets and insisting the tariffs may never happen trade officials are working the phones but will not identify potential sanctions to avoid painting oneself into a corner according to one canadian source
a second canadian source familiar with the issue said officials are making the point that the steel and aluminum industries are so integrated that an exemption for canada the largest supplier of both steel and aluminum to the united states is obvious but admitted leveraging contacts may not matter in the end
as we have all seen in this particular context with this particular administration there is one guy who is going to decide at the end said the second source who spoke on the condition of anonymity referring to president donald trump
liberal prime minister justin trudeau said on friday that tariffs would be absolutely unacceptable and would cause significant and serious disruption to the market on both side of the border

the last time canada prepared for a trade war with the united states in over contentious meat labeling rules it targeted dozens of seemingly random american exports from cherries and chocolate to wine and office chairs
the goods had been chosen to hit where key legislators live rather than inflict broader economic pain
industry groups and voters pressed elected officials to avoid retaliation that would have especially hurt their own districts
they tried the charm offensive it didn t do the trick said gerry ritz who was canadian agriculture minister in the conservative government of the time
they ve spent a lot of time and money wandering around down there but haven t hit the right people
