rpt-canada's first nations seek bigger stakes, profits from oil sector
repeats for additional clients with no changes to text by rod nickel and nia williams calgary alberta march reuters canada s first nations are boosting investments and leveraging their clout with regulators to gain stakes in oil and gas projects as they seek greater returns on energy produced or transported across their territory
aboriginal groups in canada have traditionally played a more passive role in the energy industry collecting royalties from oil and gas output
that model is changing as some indigenous groups buy oil wells and negotiate ownership stakes in proposed pipelines and storage projects
it s assets that create cash flow said joe dion chief executive of first frog lake energy resources corp which produces barrels of oil per day
we get a piece of the first nations also called bands play a pivotal role in canada s oil industry because governments and companies have a legal duty to consult and accommodate them before proceeding with resource projects affecting their territories
the law gives bands pretty close to an effective veto said university of saskatchewan professor ken coates
some aboriginal groups have used that leverage to stop or delay oil projects as when enbridge inc s proposed northern gateway pipeline was rejected by prime minister justin trudeau in after bands raised environmental concerns
other indigenous groups however are increasingly using the same power to negotiate ownership stakes in projects
a bigger financial role for first nations in the sector could help unlock oil and gas reserves in canada the world s fifth largest producer that might otherwise stay in the ground because of objections from environmental or aboriginal rights groups
their experience parallels that of native american tribes who are also deeply split on whether and how to develop the vast resources on tribal lands
indigenous canadians make up about percent of the nation s population and face higher levels of poverty and violence giving bands a powerful incentive to maximize energy revenues to raise living standards
it s so polarized said stephen buffalo chief executive of the advocacy group indian resource council
some want to see the benefit others think it s going to kill the frog lake a firm owned by alberta s frog lake first nation is looking to buy more properties outside of its territory along with stakes in tank farms and pipelines said dion who is a member of the neighboring kehewin cree nation
dion said aboriginal groups have traditionally settled for the smaller stuff royalties from outside energy firms
the piece is here now dion said
that is where we have to aboriginal groups have a legal say in projects on their lands which are held in trust by the canadian government for band members and also those that might impact them indirectly
first nations support gives energy firms better odds of overcoming any concerns from other aboriginal groups
ottawa on unveiled draft legislation for resource projects that places greater emphasis on considering their impact on aboriginal communities
under the rules for assessing major projects to take effect next year such concerns will be heard by the new canadian energy regulator and impact assessment agency of canada
examples of first nations taking bigger roles in energy projects are mounting
rbc capital markets north american head of project finance mark saar said the bank is seeing more pipeline and storage companies seeking financial partnerships with aboriginals
rbc in december completed a c million bond issue for the fort mckay and mikisew cree bands the largest ever private investment by a first nation allowing them to buy a percent stake in a suncor energy storage facility
the deal was oversubscribed saar said
we think there would be appetite for further similar some investors find aboriginals involvement in energy projects appealing given that their support is often critical for regulatory approvals saar said
others however worry about being tied to first nations finances because of historic mismanagement by some bands
investors and lenders are displaying greater acceptance of first nations as players said david sharpe a mohawk aboriginal and chief executive of debt firm bridging finance referring to rbc s bond issue
bridging finance last year financed an unnamed first nation s c million purchase of stakes in producing oil wells and is working on four more similar deals sharpe said
investment bank altacorp capital is raising funds for a c billion billion oil pipeline proposed to run from alberta to the northern british columbia coast
the project has modest financial backing from one of canada s richest families the aquilini group and support from first nations to use their land
in exchange for allowing that access the bands will own at least percent of the pipeline and a corresponding share of the profits
if built eagle spirit would be a crucial second outlet to the pacific ocean for crude from the oil sands which currently sells at a steep discount because of transportation constraints
eagle spirit energy holdings proposed oil pipeline has strong interest from energy companies and investors said eagle spirit president and chairman calvin helin who is aboriginal
the firm s main roadblock is a proposed government moratorium against oil tankers along the ecologically sensitive northern
coast
two other private investor groups and with the political support of some first nations are proposing to build railways running from alberta s oil sands to alaska avoiding the coastline of british columbia because of the pipeline opposition there
matt vickers head of declined to detail the investors financial arrangements with the bands
new railways could provide an alternative to kinder morgan canada s trans mountain pipeline expansion from alberta to british columbia which has been delayed by one year due to the environmental concerns of the
government some aboriginals and municipalities
when chief isaac became leader of alberta s woodland cree nation in he was struck by the contrast between his band s precarious finances and the hydrocarbon wealth surrounding its territory
three years later signed an agreement allowing baytex energy corp to drill in exchange for modest royalties and jobs
now the woodland cree are granting permission for eagle spirit pipeline to use its land in exchange for an undisclosed ownership stake
such opportunities have won over some groups trying to balance economic prosperity with environmental protection
there s been a real awakening said who is looking for further investment in oil and gas assets
everything in our world is touched by oil and gas whether we like it or canadian dollars additional reporting by valerie volcovici in washington editing by simon webb and brian thevenot
