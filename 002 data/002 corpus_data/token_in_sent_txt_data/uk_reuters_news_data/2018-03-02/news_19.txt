tapping the lithium rush, canadian miner stakes claims in utah
washington march reuters a small canadian mining company has staked claim to mineral rights on over a hundred thousand acres of federal land in utah since last year hoping to tap lithium deposits from spent oil wells to feed america s battery industry
the play by mgx minerals is part of a global scramble for the metal used in smart phones electric vehicles and storage for power generated by wind and solar installations
mgx minerals shares have surged percent this year to c
still analysts were divided over prospects of the move
the company said it was encouraged by president donald trump s administration s move this year to encourage more production of lithium and other metals on a list of critical minerals it says are important for national security
officials understand that the needs a supply of lithium and is cognizant of global competition said mgx ceo jared lazerson in an interview
he called utah one of the best places to start for lithium for north the united states currently has only one active lithium operation owned by albemarle corp in nevada and imports more than half the lithium it consumes
other companies including westwater resources us lithium corp and pure energy are also trying to develop new lithium projects in the united states to feed rising demand
mgx is focusing its mineral rights claims on southeastern utah s paradox basin a productive oil and gas drilling area
the company plans to extract lithium from drilling wastewater using a proprietary filtration system it has piloted in western canada s oil patch
much of the world s lithium is filtered from underground brines though relatively little is extracted from petroleum wastewater the volumes of which have been increasing in the united states due to a production boom
in this fundamental shift we are in between fossil fuels and renewable energy we get these hybrid models lazerson said referring to his company s technology
analysts have given the venture mixed reviews
think about drilling a hole meters long through rock to hit brine in utah and coming up with negligible lithium said jon hykawy a battery minerals analyst at stormcrow capital
wildcatting for water is probably not a great business stephan bogner an analyst for rockstone research was more optimistic if mgx can prove commercial a big rethinking may begin in the united states as to where capital should be deployed he said
it would be a despite burgeoning demand for lithium from battery producers around the world some analysts believe the market for the metal is headed for a glut
on monday morgan stanley sent lithium stocks tumbling when it forecast a surplus in that would drive prices down to half their current level
some industry officials took issue with the outlook
lazerson said he has been told by companies to get them anything that has any lithium in he did not disclose details
lazerson said wastewater brines available in southeastern utah are relatively rich in lithium for north america with content as high as parts per million
the company hired utah land acquisition company plateau ventures to stake out claims in the area and it hopes to start commercial production of lithium from the holdings within months
you have tesla and gm bringing electric vehicles on line with no significant new source of lithium
everyone is struggling for feedstock right now he said
he said he could not disclose the companies with which mcx is in supply talks
an official for electric car maker tesla inc did not immediately respond to a request for comment
gm spokesman tony cervone said the company would not publicly comment on specific sourcing of commodities
the geological survey said in a report last month that global lithium consumption rose more than percent in to tons driven by surging electric vehicle production in china and elsewhere with prices rising worldwide
in the united states prices rose more than percent to a metric ton
lithium supply security has become a top priority for technology companies in the united states and asia the report noted
chile and australia are currently the world s top lithium producers accounting for more than half of global output
mgx s most advanced projects are in alberta where it holds over a million acres of mineral rights
in january the company concentrated lithium from heavy oil waste water in the province using its rapid filtration process with results confirmed by the saskatchewan research council
lazerson said the company s pilot plant in calgary is on track to reach commercial scale early this year
