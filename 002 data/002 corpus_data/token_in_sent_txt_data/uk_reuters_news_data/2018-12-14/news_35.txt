feature-ukraine cities gear up to run on local clean energy by 2050
katowice poland dec thomson reuters foundation f ossil ukraine will strengthen its climate change action plan under the paris agreement to curb global warming its government said at climate talks in poland this week
four ukrainian cities also reaffirmed their goal of shifting to percent renewable energy by announced this year
svitlana romanko eastern europe caucasus and central asia director for climate campaign said ukrainian citizens and mayors were showing that a rapid and fair transition to clean energy was both possible and popular
the new national target should reflect and build on these cities climate and energy plans she added
ukraine has pledged to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least percent from levels by under the paris accord
by its emissions had already fallen percent due to an economic collapse following the of the soviet union
ilya eremenko head of the ukrainian climate network said many cities had set their own goals for reducing emissions which are far more ambitious than national ones
a combination of national and local targets is crucial for effective climate policy he added
in june the northwest ukrainian city of zhytomyr became the first city in the wider region to adopt a target of using percent renewable energy by according to its mayor
three other ukrainian cities chortkiv and lviv have since signed up to the same ambition
in ukraine energy is a crucial issue in both international and domestic politics zhytomyr mayor serhiy sukhomlyn told the thomson reuters foundation at september s global climate action summit in san francisco
moving to local clean energy production would end dependence on imported fossil fuels including natural gas which can be exploited for political ends he said
hundred percent renewable also means percent energy independence sukhomlyn said
major rows have flared up several times with russia over issues such as whether ukraine siphoned off gas supplies for europe as they were transported through russia s neighbouring state as well as payments relating to gas supply and transit
since russia annexed the ukrainian region of crimea in ukraine imports gas mainly from other european countries though some of that originates from russia
and it is aiming to produce more from its own fields including shale gas in future
to help end zhytomyr s dependency on gas and other fossil fuels it plans to build a mw solar power plant by and add another mw of solar capacity later
today renewable sources account for less than percent of energy used by the city known as the birthplace of soviet rocket engineer sergei korolev who played a lead role in launching the first human into space
zhytomyr is also planning four plants and three biofuel plants replacing close to half the gas used by the city in the next few years
sukhomlyn said the projects had been made possible by reforms to decentralise energy production in ukraine
local authorities and municipalities are getting a lot of independence enabling them to develop partnerships with investors and international financial institutions he said
the energy transition in the city of just over people is supported by donors including germany switzerland and slovenia as well as multilateral financial institutions
sukhomlyn said the city plans to reduce energy consumption by at least percent by and curb related emissions
to help achieve that it will retrofit schools and other municipal buildings put in new electric trolley buses and use led bulbs for street lighting
the district heating system will be modernised with boilers that run on biofuels including wood chips and farm waste
the city has also launched a programme to fund insulation for housing associations
the overall transformation aims to bring down energy prices for households by percent the city council said
producing energy locally will be cheaper than importing gas and efficiency measures will lower usage it added
the economic rationale for going in energy is key to getting citizens onboard said the mayor
fossil fuel prices have recently been increasing and switching to local energy sources will provide stable and cheaper alternatives sukhomlyn said
in zhytomyr joined the global covenant of mayors for climate and energy an international coalition and committed to reduce its carbon emissions by at least percent by
two years later a working group uniting city government experts municipal energy companies scientists and the public drafted a sustainable energy policy
climate action group will help city authorities develop further plans for the transition to renewable energy and craft a climate strategy in together with inhabitants
public demand for clean energy is also an opportunity for city residents to have an influence over the decision makers on local climate and energy solutions said romanko
activists meanwhile have launched an app called climate drops that rewards green behaviour such as recycling and
when residents bring plastic bottles to the recycling centre for example they receive points or drops via the app which can be traded for discounts in restaurants and stores
the app has spread to another cities across the country and has about active users
excluding large hydropower dams renewable energy accounts for less than percent of ukraine s electricity production said komila nabiyeva of energy watch group a network of scientists and parliamentarians
the government has set a target to generate percent from renewable sources but that includes hydropower which already accounts for percent making the goal unambitious said nabiyeva
this year ukraine also published a development strategy through to aimed at helping work out how to boost renewable energy and implement energy efficiency measures while modernising its electricity grid and transport infrastructure
nabiyeva said a recent study by energy watch group and finland s lut university showed ukraine s electricity could be supplied entirely from local renewable energy sources excluding large hydro dams by which would be more than today s system based mainly on coal and nuclear
the government s current energy strategy which runs until prioritises growth in hydropower
while it is aimed at reducing production the plan could be thwarted by strong coal lobby groups warned ukrainian energy journalist sergey golovnev
