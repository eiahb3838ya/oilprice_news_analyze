climate ideals clash with coal realities at polish-led u.n. talks
katowice poland reuters delegates at climate talks in the polish city of katowice point to the mining museum next to the conference venue as the proper place for coal which provides percent of the country s electricity
poland s decision to host the negotiations to revive the paris agreement on phasing out fossil fuel has laid bare the tension between goals and business realities
a short drive from the conference venue at the silesian region s dozen or so remaining mines tonnes of freshly dug coal thunder down shoots to be to power plants for generation
coal bosses see a need to address climate risk but say poland must use thermal coal for electricity until it has a better option
silesia also produces coking coal used in steel and viewed as a strategic mineral even by the european union which seeks to be an environmental leader
poland s jsw the european union s largest coking coal producer is seeking to grow
the world has to tackle the increase of carbon dioxide emissions but i do not see a chance the world can live without steel these days and there is not an easy solution to substitute steel and substitute coking coal ceo daniel ozon told reuters
financial backing can be an issue for all forms of coal and jsw has its eye on chinese banks as international lenders are wary
for many poles coal mining symbolizes national independence
companies can look to a government striving to win over an electorate divided between an older generation that associates coal with a reliable income and a sense of community and youths engaged in climate protests
as the demonstrators march international business works to keep shareholders on side
one of the climate team from the world s biggest producer of coking coal bhp was among business representatives taking part in the side events accompanying the negotiations
the talks have proved long and fractious with including a revolt by saudi arabia russia the united states and kuwait against a major scientific report that laid out the reasons to limit global warming to degrees celsius
the real challenge is not whether it s degrees or degrees it s that not enough is happening graham winkelman bhp s practice lead on climate change said in an interview
bhp stands apart from other big miners with a goal to make its own operations carbon neutral in line with the paris agreement by the second half of the century
but just as governments have to work out practicalities it is also unclear how bhp can achieve its goals
there is no definitive winkelman said although he repeated a frequent industry request for a carbon price to help shift investment towards a greener technology
poland s aim is to share the challenges of bringing about a just transition polish deputy environment minister michal kurtyka who presided over the talks said
as a graduate of paris elite ecole polytechnique a physicist an economist and an engineer his favored solution is electric vehicles
with fewer moving parts and less wasted heat than internal combustion engines he says they will help even if they run on power
as a citizen of a country that switched in from a centrally planned to a market economy kurtyka has experience of deep change
in my young days growing up in krakow that was a completely different city from now
at the lights switched off
you could not open the window because of air pollution he said
in katowice some residents say they still can t let the air in and are not confident that is about to change
