cuadrilla pauses gas fracking at english site after more tremors
london reuters british shale gas company cuadrilla has paused fracking at its preston new road site in lancashire northwest england for the fourth time since october following a minor seismic event it said on friday
the company has had to repeatedly stop operations at the site since they began two months ago under britain s traffic light regulation system which immediately suspends work if seismic activity of magnitude or above is detected
cuadrilla has paused and will continue to monitor micro seismicity for at least hours after the event was recorded the company said in a statement adding that well integrity has been checked and verified
fracking or hydraulically fracturing involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure
it is fiercely opposed by environmentalists who say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with britain s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
the government however is keen to cut the country s reliance on imports of natural gas which is used to heat around percent of britain s homes
cuadrilla is percent owned by australia s aj lucas while a fund managed by riverstone holds a percent stake
cuadrilla said last month it had extracted its first shale gas from the site
gas flows were small but coming at such an early stage of the project were evidence of the site s potential it said
