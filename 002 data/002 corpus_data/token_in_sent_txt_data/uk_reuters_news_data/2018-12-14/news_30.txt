norway postpones decision on arctic oil terminal
oslo reuters the norwegian government has postponed a decision on whether to mandate the construction of an oil processing terminal near the arctic tip of northern europe until the third quarter of next year it said on friday
if built the onshore veidnes terminal would receive crude via a pipeline from equinor s offshore johan castberg oilfield which is expected to start producing in late
equinor originally ditched plans for an onshore terminal in order to save costs preferring instead to load oil on to crude tankers at the field before exporting it to global markets
parliament earlier this year urged the government to secure the construction of an onshore terminal however as it would generate significant investment and jobs in the remote region
the energy ministry said on friday further studies were needed into the project which is supported by labour unions
environmentalists however oppose both the oilfield and the proposed terminal
