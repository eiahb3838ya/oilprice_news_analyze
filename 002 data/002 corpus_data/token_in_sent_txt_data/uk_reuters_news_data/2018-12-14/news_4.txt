palmali to fight court ruling on bankruptcy of russian arm
moscow dec reuters palmali one of the biggest players in russia s cargo market plans to appeal against a court decision declaring its russian business bankrupt and effectively handing its fleet over to sberbank the shipping firm s owner said on friday
last month a court in in southern russia declared the palmali unit bankrupt
the unit owes million to sberbank with almost all of its roughly ships held as collateral with russia s largest bank
palmali also owes billion roubles million to russia s tax authorities
palmali s owner mubariz mansimov told reuters the company which is headquartered in istanbul and also operates in the black and mediterranean seas planned to challenge the ruling
we will continue legal actions against sberbank and tax authorities of the russian federation he added
for some reasons sberbank didn t want to restructure our debt in an emailed reply to reuters sberbank said bankruptcy proceeding were the best way to resolve the palmali unit s debt problems
meanwhile we support the company s willingness to continue its business as usual until after the bankruptcy process is finished this would help to preserve the fleet and workers sberbank said
palmali has around staff in russia
the company has handled large volumes of oil and products exports plying routes between refineries in the volga region and black and azov seas
one of its main clients is the novoshakhtinsk oil refinery in southern russia
however it has suffered from cheaper transport options such as railways and pipelines
river shipments in russia which include cargoes of grains and construction materials oil products and cars fell percent in from the year before according to kpmg
western sanctions imposed for moscow s role in ukraine s crisis have also hit some shippers
mansimov said the sanctions paralysed the firm which uses the russian flag on most of its vessels operating in russia
we can t enter ukraine with a russian flag aboard
there is also pressure from the western companies
they just don t want to hand their cargoes to a russian flag he said
