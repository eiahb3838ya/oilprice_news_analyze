by michelle nichols united nations reuters the united states accused north korea on thursday of breaching a sanctions cap on refined petroleum by making illicit transfers between ships at sea according to a document seen by reuters and demanded an immediate end to all sales of the fuel

the united states provided a list to the security council committee of illicit north korean transactions and a few select photos seen by reuters
if fully loaded at around percent laden dprk tankers have delivered nearly triple the quota at barrels the united states said
it asked the north korea sanctions committee to issue an urgent note to all member states notifying them that north korea has breached the refined petroleum cap and order an immediate halt to all transfers
the security council has unanimously boosted sanctions on north korea since in a bid to choke off funding for pyongyang s nuclear and ballistic missile programs banning exports including coal iron lead textiles and seafood and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products
in march the council blacklisted dozens of ships and shipping companies over oil and coal smuggling by north korea
