update 1-russian steelmakers play down impact of eu's import curbs
adds reaction from other russian steel producers analysts by anastasia lyrchikova and polina devitt moscow july reuters russian steel producers played down the impact of the european union s curbs on steel imports on wednesday which according to analysts may even allow some of them to increase supplies to the bloc compared with a year ago
on thursday the eu will set the quotas for steel product categories at the average of imports over the past three years with a percent tariff set for volumes exceeding those amounts
the quotas which are allocated on a basis are designed to prevent a surge of steel imports into the bloc following the imposition of tariffs on incoming steel and aluminium
we regret that states continue to maintain a policy of protectionism and are thereby damaging the longstanding world trading system and contributing to further uncertainty in the markets said severstal the largest supplier of russian steel products to the eu
the eu s decision will not have a significant impact on severstal s financial results due to the flexibility of its distribution channels it said adding that it planned to continue its supplies to european customers within the announced quotas
russia is one of the main exporters of steel to the eu along with china india south korea turkey and ukraine
for russian steel products the eu is the largest export market due to the relatively short transportation distance
severstal s rival nlmk also hopes to continue business as usual despite the eu s curbs it said
other players in the russian steel market evraz for which europe is not the main market and mmk which supplies steel products to the bloc declined to comment
severstal nlmk and mmk may even increase their sales to the eu compared with as the new quotas are estimated to be materially higher then their sales to the bloc analysts at bcs said
