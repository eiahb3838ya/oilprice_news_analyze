update 1-russia urges u.n. to mull easing n.korea sanctions as u.s. seeks action
nations reuters russia s envoy to north korea said on wednesday it would be logical to raise the question of easing sanctions on north korea with the united nations security council as the united states pushes for a halt to refined petroleum exports to pyongyang
the positive change on the korean peninsula is now obvious said the ambassador alexander matsegora according to the ria news agency adding that russia was ready to help modernise north korea s energy system if sanctions were lifted and if pyongyang can find funding for the modernisation
the security council has unanimously boosted sanctions on north korea since in a bid to choke off funding for pyongyang s nuclear and ballistic missile programs banning exports including coal iron lead textiles and seafood and capping imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products
china tried late last month to get the security council to issue a statement praising the june singapore meeting between president donald trump and north korean leader kim jong un and expressing its willingness to adjust the measures on the dprk in light of the dprk s compliance with the north korea s official name is democratic people s republic of korea dprk
but the united states blocked the statement on june given ongoing and very sensitive talks between the united states and the dprk at this time diplomats said
the same day secretary of state mike pompeo spoke to his chinese counterpart wang yi about the importance of sanctions enforcement
secretary of state mike pompeo is due to informally brief security council envoys along with south korea and japan on friday
diplomats say they expect pompeo to stress the need to maintain pressure on north korea during his briefing on friday
in a tweet on wednesday trump said he elicited a promise from russian president vladimir putin to help negotiate with north korea but did not say how
he also said there is no rush the sanctions remain the united states accused north korea last week of breaching a sanctions cap on refined petroleum by making illicit transfers between ships at sea and demanded an immediate end to all sales of the fuel
the united states submitted the complaint to the security council north korea sanctions committee which is due to decide by thursday whether it will tell all member states to halt all transfers of refined petroleum to pyongyang
such decisions are made by consensus and some diplomats said they expected china or russia to delay or block the move
when asked on june about whether sanctions should be loosened russian
ambassador vassily nebenzia said we should be thinking about steps in that direction because inevitably there is progress on the track that should be reciprocal that should be a street
