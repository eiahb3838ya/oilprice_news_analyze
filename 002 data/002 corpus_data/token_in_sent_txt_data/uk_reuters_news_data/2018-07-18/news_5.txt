update 1-u.s. court blocks epa decision not to enforce 'glider truck' limits
washington reuters a federal appeals court on wednesday temporarily blocked a decision by the environmental protection agency that would have lifted strict limits on the number of remanufactured heavy duty vehicles known as glider trucks that could be sold
the vehicles have a used engine in a new frame and rules introduced under former president barack obama a democrat said nearly all new trucks on the road must use more efficient less polluting engines
the glider trucks emit up to times more diesel particulate matter and up to times more nitrogen oxides than new trucks on the market the epa has said epa issued a memo on july that said the agency would not enforce a limit of up to gliders per manufacturer
the epa in november formally proposed undoing the glider rule but has not finalized it
the epa which said wednesday it was reviewing the decision had said in its memo that enforcing the rules would result in the loss of jobs and threaten the viability of companies making the glider trucks
volvo group north america cummins inc and navistar international corp said last year they opposed efforts to reverse the limits on glider trucks
glider kits should not be used for circumventing purchase of currently certified the move could inflict uncertainty and damage to our industry the companies said
environmental defense fund president fred krupp said the decision today is an important step toward protecting the health of all americans from diesel freight the court of appeals for the district of columbia said the epa must respond to the lawsuit from environmental groups by july
the court order said the stay is to give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion and not a ruling on the merits of blocking the memo
the epa has previously said that if gliders were allowed through they would make up percent of the freight trucks on the road but would account for one third of all nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions from the heavy truck fleet
glider companies told the epa that glider trucks are percent cheaper than new vehicles
in august the obama administration issued final rules to cut greenhouse gas emissions from medium and heavy duty trucks through a sector that accounts for percent of carbon pollution from vehicles
the commercial vehicle rules are expected to cut billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions the obama administration estimated
