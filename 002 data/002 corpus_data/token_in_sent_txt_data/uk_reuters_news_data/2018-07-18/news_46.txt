analysis-for the global lng industry, is the fsru honeymoon over?
london reuters a giant vessel docked at the port of moheshkhali in bangladesh two months ago propelling the populous but poor nation into the club of liquefied natural gas lng buyers
the excellence is the latest floating storage and regasification unit fsru a type of carrier that has proliferated since as many countries switch to a cleaner and increasingly cheaper fuel than oil and coal
but the young fsru industry has been beset by more project delays than successes in the past months as fluctuating energy prices shipping rates government policies and not least strong demand for gas in china reshape the sector
with the number of countries importing lng having risen to from in three years plug and play projects in which regasification vessels link to physical and commercial infrastructure are expected to continue if at a slower pace
but strong chinese demand for lng has dampened the allure of projects in other countries by lapping up excess supply and new entrants are trying to develop smaller ventures
in the last year or so fsrus have suffered a bit of a setback from the stellar growth they were previously enjoying andrew buckland wood mackenzie s global lng trade and shipping principal analyst said
some of that is down to conditions unique to particular proposed projects
but a lot of it is more to do with demand being stronger than expected in existing conventional since a golden period between and when almost half of the world s fsrus came onstream projects in ghana pakistan and ivory coast have been scrapped and in countries such as chile croatia and south africa delayed
those stung include oil majors such as exxonmobil trading houses including trafigura and shipping companies that provide fsrus such as norway s hoegh lng
some have backed off others have regrouped in different configurations
for graphic on imports of lng by floating regasification vessels vs select countries and oil and lng prices click fsrus are relatively new the first was put in operation in by excelerate which figured out how to fit an entire lng terminal onto a single ship
the unlisted company together with golar and hoegh now dominates the industry
on the face of it they have a big advantage over onshore import terminals cheaper by half at around million twice as quick to deliver and flexible to boot because the vessel can journey to other destinations once it is not needed
this was shown by egypt s first fsru project completed by privately owned bw group within just five months at ain sokhna on the suez canal
but the project was an ideal plug and play venture suffering severe power cuts as its own gas output fell egypt had the infrastructure to accept regasified lng
conversely ghana demonstrates the difficulties of what are still complex projects despite their lower costs and lead times
the country has yet to enter the lng club despite coming so close that two fsrus were earmarked for two projects
here issues related to the construction of onshore infrastructure and solid contracts with power plants the end consumers of the lng delayed and scuppered successive ventures
the golar and hoegh fsrus were reassigned to other locations
developing countries by their nature have limited capacity when it comes to policy and regulatory structures said lance crist head of natural resources for international finance corp a world bank arm that has lent to several fsru projects
many of these are much smaller markets
you re not talking about large liquid markets with established infrastructure where you can just plug and play he said
while the ghana saga unravelled over the past three years global lng market trends changed the dynamics of fsru projects
rates for transporting lng rose boosting the revenues of lng shipping companies that were thinking of branching into fsrus and china s demand for gas skyrocketed soaking up an anticipated oversupply in the market
china s environmental drive to convert heating plants from coal to gas drove percent of global lng demand growth last year and increased chinese gas imports by percent making it the lng buyer after japan the international energy agency said in june
this created less urgency to open new markets by parking fsrus in countries that had hitherto not bought lng
existing terminals usually underused took more supplies
the result has been a slowdown in the delivery of planned projects
prior to last winter when it looked like there d be excess lng creating new demand centres via fsrus looked a more attractive strategy than it does now buckland said
which is not to say they won t come back to that in the meanwhile lng carrier rates which slumped to per day in more than tripled to a day
this meant those companies that operate lng carriers but wanted to join the fsru bonanza had missed the boat at least for now
for example lng carrier company flex lng backed out of the fsru business in may saying shipping rates and project delays had made the move unattractive compared to improved carrier rates its chief source of revenue
some large projects are still due to come onstream if at a slower pace ivory coast is scheduled to become an nation by with a total project using a golar fsru
the rush of new projects between and together with predictions of lng oversupply also attracted trading houses wanting to secure markets for the rising volumes they bought and sold
trafigura vitol and gunvor have competing plans for fsrus in pakistan after the country became an lng importer in but have failed to get projects in bangladesh off the ground
now the urgency has receded with china s growing appetite for lng
but there has been a proliferation of much smaller projects ventures fsrus for single users such as fertiliser plants and petrol stations for ships using lng as bunker fuel in northern europe
the old fsru only business model is becoming crowded with pressure on returns golar told investors in june saying it was turning to projects to drive some of its growth
the world bank s ifc has also recognised the new trends and is hunting for more projects
we are still in the very early stages of a pretty dramatic transformation crist said
you require critical mass or scale
once you have an anchor project then you can start doing the milk run smaller cargos that will proliferate pretty soon over the next five reporting by sabina zawadzki editing by dale hudson
