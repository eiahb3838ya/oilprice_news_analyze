rpt-vitol invests in coal-to-oil venture as un shipping fuel rules loom
repeats to additional subscribers no change to text by julia payne london july reuters energy trader vitol and coal miner peabody energy are partnering with arq to turn coal waste into a oil product that could be an alternative fuel for shippers as new pollution rules loom the companies said in a statement
global oil and shipping companies are looking at any and all options to avoid becoming a casualty of the major market dislocations that the new standards will create when they come into effect in
the international maritime organization imo will ban ships using fuel with a sulphur content higher than percent compared to percent now unless a vessel has equipment to clean up its sulphur emissions
but few have added such equipment
as a result most will face a skyrocketing fuel bill as they switch to more expensive but cleaner marine gasoil
arq ceo julian mcintyre told reuters in an interview that its fuel would meet the new standards and could be used by the shipping industry to cut costs
it would also reduce the volume of pollutants coming from the coal industry
its technology isolates hydrocarbon particles from feedstock coal waste to produce a fine powder that can be blended into fuel oil and marine gasoil as well as crude
the coal industry throws away anything below millimeters and that fine particle coal becomes waste mcintyre said
we take that feedstock and turn it into products that are worth much more than the those hydrocarbons are essentially free mcintyre said
the coal industry throws out billion tonnes of them a year the equivalent of million barrels of oil per day he said
including transport mcintyre said the firm is aiming to produce and deliver its fuel to port for less than a barrel of oil equivalent which could be blended into fuel oil to account for up to percent of a barrel
arq is in the process of building its first plant in kentucky united states which is expected to start up by early
our basic plant design is to produce million tonnes per annum mcintyre said
our plan is to build plants over the next years with production equivalent of about million bpd of he added that a single plant costs about million to build and takes about months to complete
other uses for arq s fuel would be to blend it into crude oil that would give refiners a greater yield of middle distillates which are products or to press it back together into pieces to be sold to utilities
the partnership will allow arq to set up plants alongside peabody mines to capture its waste while vitol will provide logistics including blending the new fuel before it reaches customers
arq said it has a valuation of over million from industry and financial investors
in its latest million funding round vitol and peabody agreed to each invest million
it is an interesting technology with good potential
we ll offer a range of solutions to help our customers comply with imo
there are many factors which will dictate which method of compliance is adopted mike muller of vitol said in his first statement since joining the firm from shell
vitol the world s largest independent oil trader has made a few forays into green and alternative fuel investments including in uk battery projects a new synthetic fuel from recycled plastic and a new fund to develop renewable energies like wind power
