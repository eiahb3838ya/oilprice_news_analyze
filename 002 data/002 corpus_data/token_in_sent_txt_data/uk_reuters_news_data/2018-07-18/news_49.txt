rpt-analysis-not dead yet: home of brent crude gets new lease of life
repeating story with no changes to text north sea revival seen due to government industry initiatives uk authorities cut taxes established benchmarks unit costs halved by efficiencies technology changing of guard to small firms many backed by private equity by ron bousso and shadia nasralla london july reuters oil giant bp s eastern trough area project off the coast of scotland wasn t supposed to be viable beyond
but government and industry working together have given etap a new lease of life that is being closely watched by countries and companies eyeing other ageing projects around the world
when etap was launched years ago today some experts predicted the uk sector of the north sea would cease most production by
government efforts to keep producers in the basin home to the brent crude that underpins the price benchmark gained urgency with the oil price crash
cheaper oil also forced the industry to upgrade technology and find more efficiencies
from original plans to stop production at etap bp decided to invest billion in
one has to take stock of the potential going forward and make an intervention that allows for the right investment to extend life ariel flores bp s north sea chief told reuters
we ve done that on etap s example shows how efforts to extend the production in the north sea are succeeding providing lessons for producers in other fields near exhaustion such as those in the gulf of mexico and southeast asia
etap produces around barrels per day of oil now against as much as bpd in
but bp production in the entirety of the north sea is set to double in to bpd from as fields such as clair ridge west of shetland islands come on line flores said
there are a number of fields in the central north sea area waiting for final investment decisions fids
and for some of those the potential host is etap flores said
oil giants such as bp royal dutch shell and total as well as smaller nimbler north producers such as enquest and premier oil are all finding business opportunities in the area
the region has also seen something of a changing of the guard in recent years
shell bp omv and engie have sold fields and infrastructure to smaller players many of which are backed by private equity or specialise in squeezing more life out of mature assets such as chrysaor siccar point and neptune
chrysaor acquired around half of shell s north sea portfolio last year and is now one of the largest operators in the basin boosting reserves by drilling wells around ageing fields such as the armada field
six years ago you went to the raising money and everyone was talking about fiscal instability decommissioning a basin in decline and that has completely changed chrysaor ceo phil kirk told reuters
now people talk about opportunity about a change in the ownership of the oil and gas companies invested billions in the north sea in the late to meet surging demand from asia but the subsequent oil price rally masked huge inefficiencies and waste
when the bottom fell out in as shale producers in the united states competed with opec for market share output had already dwindled to around million barrels per day from a peak of million in
investments were drying up and many operators were focused on plugging wells and dismantling fields
that s where the uk government stepped in
scottish oil and gas magnate ian wood was commissioned in to look at how government could stem the outflow from an industry that provides jobs in the region
the wood report led to the creation of the independent oil and gas authority oga and a regulatory overhaul including scrapping a percent petroleum revenue tax and starting in november allowing the transfer of the tax history of an asset to the buyer who can then offset tax on decommissioning
on the decommissioning side they operators can see that it s more manageable they can see there are improvements happening they can see that the government has listened oga director of operations gunther newcombe told reuters
tax cuts for the industry in and alone amounted to billion pounds the government says
the oga also started working with north sea operators to assemble and share cost benchmarks
some thought the uk north sea was facing a terminal decline but it wasn t for lack of resource in the ground it was investment appetite it was portfolio issues and perceived barriers for investment said chrysaor s kirk
industry made its own changes
using simpler field designs replacing kit from paints to seabed pumps with equipment and increasing cooperation among producers to save on transportation and development costs the north sea today can compete with other offshore basins and in some cases even onshore shale
sensors that bp has installed on drilling equipment and pumps now detect minuscule vibrations that give engineers precious extra hours or even minutes to change a valve or shut down a unit preventing serious damage and minimising downtime for a field for example
we are looking at things more collaboratively trusting contractors to be able to come up with solutions for us flores said
at times there had been duplication of work checking and recalculating calculations
now there s a drive towards eliminating bp s operating efficiency in the north sea is now more than percent up from percent earlier this decade he said
for the uk oil sector as a whole including the north sea production efficiency measured as a percentage of potential maximum output is now percent compared to a low of percent in the oga said this week
industry body uk oil and gas says unit operating costs last year were around per barrel of oil equivalent half that in
producers have also become effective in slowing the natural decline of fields according to the bernstein brokerage and research group
the rate of output decline has come down to percent in from percent in
in the ultimate show of confidence companies are new projects
dozens of companies competed for blocks to explore and develop new fields in may
another licencing round for blocks will close in november
we re finding a huge appetite for the uk
we re looking currently at possibly sanctioning projects this year said the oga s newcombe
we ve got around that we re looking at right now
last year we sanctioned two
this year we sanctioned five shell in february decided to go ahead with the development of the penguins its first new project in the basin in six years followed by the fid in june on the fram condensate field
bp has approved the development of the alligin and vorlich fields west of the shetlands
two fids in six months tells you that the north sea competes for capital against other opportunities in other jurisdictions helped enormously by the government s commitment said sinead lynch shell s uk country chair
total expenditure in the north sea in including exploration development and decommissioning was half that of at around billion pounds
but production of both oil and gas is expected to grow to around million of oil equivalent per day this year from million in the oga said
i don t think the uk north sea is ready to turn its lights out for some years to come said premier chief tony durrant
