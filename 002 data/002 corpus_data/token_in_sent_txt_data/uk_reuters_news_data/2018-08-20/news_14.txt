sweden calls for nuclear reactors to be shielded from hot weather
oslo reuters sweden s nuclear energy regulator ssm has asked plant operators to produce plans in the coming months to shield their reactors from harmful hot weather its director told reuters on monday
a number of swedish reactors had to shut down or reduce output as the summer heatwave sent temperatures to record highs in july with the sea water that is used to cool them becoming much warmer than normal exceeding safety levels
the last time that ssm the swedish radiation safety authority asked operators to produce plans to modify their reactors was after japan s fukushima disaster in
the cost of those changes which are due by was in the hundreds of millions of euros
we really have to take into consideration what happened this summer we have asked them orally to come with suggestions
of course there will be a cost
i do not know how much at this stage said ssm chief mats persson said
the cost of modifications to swedish nuclear plants reached as much as million euros million per reactor persson said
persson said the regulator had asked vattenfall and uniper subsidiary okg to consider how they could shield their swedish reactors and notify ssm in the autumn to enable it to make a decision on the best options
i hope we will have results by the end of this year
it is important that we don t come to the same situation again he said
vattenfall which operates seven reactors in sweden shut a megawatt mw unit one of the four located at its ringhals plant in july as water temperatures rose above degrees celsius
the company s second plant at forsmark consists of three bwrs and vattenfall had to reduce output by megawatt per reactor as the sea water in the area climbed to more than degrees celsius
sweden s biggest reactor the gw oskarshamn was not affected and should be less vulnerable to very hot summers because of the depth from which it takes its sea water a spokesman for operator okg has said
