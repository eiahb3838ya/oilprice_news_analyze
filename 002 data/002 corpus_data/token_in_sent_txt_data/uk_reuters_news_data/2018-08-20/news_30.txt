update 1-australian pm waters down energy bill to dampen leadership pressure
sydney reuters australian prime minister malcolm turnbull on monday averted a possible leadership challenge by dropping targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions to appease his critics say local media as a poll showed his government losing voter support
conservatives in his coalition were reportedly sounding out colleagues for a possible leadership challenge before turnbull on monday announced the removal of emission reduction targets from the national energy guarantee neg policy
under headlines such as pm s leadership on knife edge major papers said some government members were gauging support for home affairs minister peter dutton to replace turnbull
dutton said he supported the prime minister
asked whether his leadership was under threat turnbull declared i enjoy the confidence of the cabinet and my party room
the leadership talk was fuelled by an ipsos poll published in fairfax newspapers which showed support for turnbull s coalition falling four points to percent points behind opposition party labor and enough for a crushing electoral defeat
the next election is due by
turnbull said his slim parliamentary majority and internal dissent with some government members saying they would vote against the energy policy left him no option but to remove the emission cuts that were part of the paris climate agreement
politics is governed by the iron laws of arithmetic and in a house of representatives with a majority if a small number of people are not prepared to vote with the government on a measure then it won t get passed turnbull told reporters
though australia remains a signatory to the paris accord the removal of emissions targets from the neg mean the country has no legislative or regulatory path to meeting the agreement s requirements
turnbull s move may relieve immediate pressure on his leadership though internal peace is seen as fragile as the government s prospects look dim
and having conceded on energy he may face demands for other changes
it s a complete capitulation to the members of the liberal party of australia said robyn eckersley professor and head of political science at university of melbourne
turnbull is desperately hanging on to his leadership above and beyond everything in turnbull then leader of the liberal party in opposition crossed the floor to vote with the labor government in favour of an emissions trading scheme a move that ultimately lost him the party leadership
a successful challenge to turnbull s prime ministership would have been the fifth change in national leadership since with no prime minister seeing out a full term in office since
