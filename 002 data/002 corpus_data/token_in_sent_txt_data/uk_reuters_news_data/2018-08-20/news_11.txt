corrected-brazil's ambev plans to add 1,600 electric trucks to fleet
sao paulo reuters brazilian beer maker ambev plans to add volkswagen electric trucks to its fleet making it the largest fleet of its kind in brazil and which would be exempt from new fixed minimum freight fares for diesel truckers
ambev said ownership of the vehicles which will replace older trucks will be with logistics companies that distribute ambev s products
it declined to name the companies
roberto cortes chief executive of volkswagen s bus and trucks operation in brazil told reuters that negotiations with ambev had long preceded the new policy which came into effect this month
the timing was pure coincidence he said though he acknowledged the rule could lead clients to rethink their fleets
ambev s plan which had not yet been firmed up follows a truckers strike in may that severely hampered the flow of food fuel and key exports for nearly two weeks and forced the government to promise changes
this month the government signed those promises into law including a minimum fare for freight to be paid to diesel truckers which is now higher than the current market rate
electric vehicles are exempt from the price minimums
it s obvious that a strike of that nature calls attention to the need of having products that are alternatives to diesel trucks cortes said
still we are not expecting any sales directly caused by this volvo ab and the truck unit of daimler ag have received inquiries from companies considering another option to avoid price minimums buying their own truck fleets instead of relying on contractors
brazil s largest logistics company jsl expects its truck rental unit to grow as it rents out vehicles directly to companies another exemption from the new rule jsl chief financial officer denys ferrez said although the company has not received any firm orders
with the electric trucks about percent of ambev s fleet will be electric which the companies said will save about tons of carbon emissions per year
it expects the trucks will be delivered by
the story corrects to show ambev will not buy the trucks directly in headline first paragraph
