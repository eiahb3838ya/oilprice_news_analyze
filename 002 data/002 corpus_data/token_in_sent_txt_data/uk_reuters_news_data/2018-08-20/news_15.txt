poland and germany disagree over planned russian gas pipeline
warsaw aug reuters poland unlike germany strongly opposes russia s plan to build a new gas pipeline across the baltic sea and shares opinion that the project would help strengthen moscow s market position polish foreign minister jacek czaputowicz said
berlin has given political support to the building of a new billion pipeline to bring russian gas across the baltic sea called nord stream bypassing traditional routes through ukraine despite qualms among other eu states
in july president donald trump publicly criticised germany for supporting the pipeline deal with russia
i would like to underline that poland s stance differs here from the german one
we see this dispute as an existing one between the and germany czaputowicz said at a joint statement with his german counterpart heiko maas
poland buys most of the gas it consumes from russia but has taken steps to reduce that reliance
in this dispute we are at the side as its arguments are more convincing and besides we have raised them before czaputowicz also said in a broadcast speech
he reiterated poland s concerns that nord stream was a harmful and political project that will strengthen russia s dominant position in the gas market and be a threat to ukraine
i know about these objections but the german government does not share them maas said
the foreign ministers spoke in harmeze south of poland near the auschwitz nazi death camp which maas visited earlier on monday
