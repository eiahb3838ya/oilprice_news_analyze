update 4-iran tells eu to speed up efforts to save nuclear deal
ankara reuters iran urged europe on monday to speed up efforts to salvage a nuclear deal between tehran and major powers that president donald trump abandoned in may saying french oil group total has formally pulled out a major gas project
efforts by the remaining signatories eu members britain france and germany plus china and russia to avoid the agreement s collapse are struggling as washington has said any firms dealing with teheran will be barred from doing business in the united states
europeans and other signatories of the deal have been trying to save the deal but the process has been slow
it should be accelerated foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi said
iran relies mainly on its own capabilities to overcome america s new sanctions he told a news conference broadcast on state tv
european states have been scrambling to ensure iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal which trump said was deeply flawed
washington imposed new sanctions on iran in august targeting its trade in gold and other precious metals purchases of dollars and its car industry
the european powers china and russia say they will do more to encourage their businesses to remain engaged with iran
but the threat of the sanctions has prompted many major companies to pull out of iran
oil minister bijan namdar zanganeh said france s total has formally left a contract to develop iran s south pars gas project
the process to replace total with another company is underway he was quoted as saying by state tv
total which signed the deal in with an initial investment of billion confirmed that it had notified the iranian authorities of its withdrawal from the deal after it failed to obtain a waiver from sanctions
iranian officials had earlier suggested that china s cnpc could take over total s stake in the offshore project
cnpc which already has a percent stake in the deal is an experienced onshore oil and gas producer but is relatively new to offshore drilling
as for the future of total s share we have not been informed of an official cnpc position but as we have always said cnpc a chinese company has the right to resume our participation if it decides so total said in an emailed statement
most of cnpc s experience lies in its subsidiary china petroleum offshore engineering company cpoe which has worked in shallow waters off north china
once total quits that will trigger cnpc to take over automatically according to the contract a senior chinese industry source with knowledge of the deal told reuters
but the question is not about if cnpc is going to take over as the operator but if cnpc could deliver and advance the project without china also faces challenges supplying equipment such as compressors needed for developing the giant gas project as leading manufacturers could be barred from supplying to iran under sanctions
carmakers psa renault and daimler are also among those to suspend or drop plans to invest in iran along with deutsche bahn and deutsche telekom working to maintain financial channels with tehran and facilitate iran s oil exports the european union has taken steps to counter the renewed sanctions including forbidding eu citizens from complying with them or related court rulings
washington has said iran s only chance of avoiding the sanctions would be to accept trump s offer to negotiate a tougher nuclear deal
iranian officials have repeatedly rejected the offer
we do not want to revisit that nuclear deal
we want the united states to implement that nuclear deal foreign minister mohammad javad zarif told cnn on sunday
the united states will impose tougher sanctions in november which will target iran s oil sales and banking sector
iran s rial currency has lost about half of its value since april because of a weak economy financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among iranians who fear the effects of sanctions
under the deal most international sanctions on iran were lifted in return for curbs on the country s nuclear programme
