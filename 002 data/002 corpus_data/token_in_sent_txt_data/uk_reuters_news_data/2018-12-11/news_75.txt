column-china's commodity import volume surge tells a different tale to slack value growth: russell
launceston australia reuters the prevailing market narrative after china s overall november trade data was that the world s economy is softening and starting to show the strains of the trade dispute with the united states
after all both imports and exports undershot forecasts for the month
but while there is nothing inherently incorrect in such commentary one factor that may not be getting as much attention as it should the growth in imports may be largely related to weaker commodity prices
china s exports rose percent in november from a year earlier well short of the percent forecast in a reuters poll
imports grew a sluggish percent considerably weaker than the percent forecast
the export weakness was largely put down to the end of of shipments to the united states ahead of the now postponed higher tariffs of percent on billion of imports from china that had been mooted by president donald trump
the import weakness was largely ascribed to slacker domestic demand
while this may be the situation for manufactured goods and services it doesn t appear to be the case for commodities
the problem with simply looking at the trade numbers is that they are expressed in dollar terms and not in volume terms
case in point crude oil where china is the world s biggest importer
china imported a record million barrels per day bpd the first time inbound shipments had topped the million bpd mark and well above the million bpd recorded in october
working out exactly how much china paid for its oil in november is challenging but it s likely to be less than it paid in october despite the extra million barrels imported
exhibit a brent crude hit a high of a barrel on and has since slumped percent to its close of on monday
this means that at the time chinese refiners were fixing cargoes for november delivery prices were declining encouraging volume growth
graphic china trade and economy of course there are other factors at work the of new refineries and their associated inventory buying increased purchases by smaller independent refiners aiming to use up their import quotas before they expire and uncertainty over when exactly imports of iranian oil cleared customs
but the overall picture isn t one of weakness for china s crude oil imports which are now up percent for the first months of the year compared to the same period in
while copper imports were weaker in november compared to the same month a year earlier they were also up strongly from october with unwrought copper jumping percent and ores and concentrates up percent
london copper prices peaked in early june and have subsequently dropped about percent
that means chinese buyers would have been paying substantially less for their imports in november than in prior months
iron ore and coal present more interesting reading
imports of both fell in november from october despite weaker prices
iron ore imports slipped percent to million tonnes while coal purchases from overseas dropped percent to million tonnes
but the weakness in these imports is almost entirely policy driven
in other words it s the deliberate choice of beijing to import less rather than a sign of domestic economic weakness
the authorities have made it clear they didn t want coal imports in to exceed those of in order to protect the local mining industry
while they will fail in this endeavour as the first months of has seen imports reach the total for it does mean that november and december coal imports will be well below potential
iron ore is struggling along with steel as winter production curbs aimed at lowering air pollution start to have an impact on the market
overall the volume of china s commodity imports the main component of its overall import bill offers more insight into the real state of the economy than looking at just the value
there are solid reasons to be cautious about the outlook for the chinese economy and the impact from the trade dispute with the united states and there are also questionmarks over whether the relatively robust commodity imports will sustain
but there is also a risk in turning too bearish too quickly by not accounting for the impact of weaker commodity prices on the value of imports by the world s biggest buyer of commodities
