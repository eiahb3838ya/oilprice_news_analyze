update 1-u.s. proposing to weaken obama-era wetland protections
washington reuters the trump administration proposed on tuesday reducing federal protections for waterways an action sought by ranching and mining interests but one that will likely be held up in the courts amid lawsuits brought by environmentalists
the environmental protection agency proposal would narrow the extent of protections in the waters of the united states wotus rule that president barack obama s administration expanded in to cover a wide range of water bodies
president donald trump who has accused obama of on regulations made rolling back wotus one of his top policy priorities
tuesday s proposal was his administration s latest effort to rescind environmental rules to boost the energy and agriculture industries
andrew wheeler the acting epa administrator said the proposal would cut costs for farmers and miners
the proposed new definition of waters puts an end to the previous administration s power grab wheeler said after signing the proposal at epa headquarters
land owners should be able to determine whether water on their property should be protected without having to hire outside professionals wheeler said
the changes defined which streams and wetlands are protected by federal clean water law from pollutants including pesticides fertilizers and mine waste
mark ryan a lawyer at ryan kuehler pllc who spent years as a clean water expert and litigator at the epa said water systems called headwaters in high regions of the country could lose protections under the new definitions being proposed by the trump administration
i think the mining industry is going to benefit from this because mines tend to be up in the mountains near headwater systems ryan said
miners may no longer need to apply for a permit before pushing waste such as rubble from coal mining in the eastern united states into some streams
ephemeral streams that make up a large percentage of the total river miles in the united states could lose protections as could what the epa calls isolated the proposal will undergo a comment period before the epa moves to finalize it
wheeler said the proposal would withstand lawsuits because the epa closely examined court cases in writing it
ryan said finalization may not happen soon if ever
i don t think this rule is ever going to see the light of day he said
this is going to be tied up in litigation for at least two years and if trump doesn t get in then it s dead he added
