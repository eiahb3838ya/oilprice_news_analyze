climate policies put world on track for 3.3c warming -cat study
katowice poland dec reuters average world temperatures are on track to far exceed the central goal set in the paris agreement on limiting global warming a study showed on tuesday
but the overshoot by the end of this century could be slightly less severe than previously expected thanks to significant efforts by some countries to combat climate change the report by carbon action tracker cat a consortium of three independent european research groups said
the paris agreement aims to restrict warming to well below two degrees celsius fahrenheit above times
the cat report said there had been some progress on the ground since and current policies meant the world was heading for warming of
that compared with the it predicted a year ago and it said that if governments were to implement planned or extra policies they had in the pipeline warming by could be limited to
even a rise of could cause loss of tropical coral reefs alpine glaciers arctic summer sea ice and perhaps an irreversible melt of greenland s ice that would drive up world sea levels a united nations science panel has said
the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc said in october that keeping the rise to was possible but would require rapid and unprecedented changes in human behaviour
we have yet to see this translate into action in terms of what governments are prepared to put on the table said bill hare chief executive of climate analytics one of the three cat research groups
since the paris accord was agreed countries including argentina canada chile and india plus the european union were moving in the right direction towards cutting emissions
if extended and scaled these combined efforts could begin to bend the global emissions curve the report said
but other countries such as the united states australia brazil indonesia russia and the united arab emirates had made either no progress or taken backward steps
