deforestation in brazil's cerrado savanna falls to record low
brasilia reuters deforestation in brazil s tropical cerrado savanna which makes up a quarter of the country fell percent to a record low in compared with a year earlier the ministry of environment said in a statement on tuesday
deforestation in the south american country s savanna biome totaled square kilometers square miles an area larger than the state of connecticut
that s just below square kilometers in the previous low since records began to be kept the ministry said
a biome is a grouping of plants and animals that have adapted to a specific environment
this contrasts with the amazon rainforest making up percent of brazil which has seen a percent spike in deforestation this year to a high
activists have been concerned that deforestation could spike under policies proposed by jair bolsonaro who assumes office and has pledged to end the current industry of fines for environmental violations like deforestation
the figure for cerrado is based on the change in deforestation between august and july the period used to measure annual destruction as recorded by brazilian space research agency inpe
the statement did not give a reason for the decline in deforestation
the cerrado s vegetation soaks up major amounts of carbon dioxide making its preservation key to curbing greenhouse gas emissions and for countering global warming
while the cerrado is less densely forested than the amazon rainforest its plants have deep roots that lock carbon into the ground and are sometimes referred to as an underground forest
ricardo salles brazil s future environment minister under bolsonaro told reuters on monday that bolsonaro would not gut resources for environmental protection contrary to the fears of environmentalists
money for environmental protection is spent inefficiently and mismanaged he said arguing he could produce better results with the same budget
