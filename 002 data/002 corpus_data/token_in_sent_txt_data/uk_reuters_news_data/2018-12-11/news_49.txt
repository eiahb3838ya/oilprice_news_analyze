australian company targets 'under-explored' gas in portugal
lisbon dec reuters a search for hydrocarbons in portugal s onshore lusitanian basin could reveal enough natural gas to supply the whole country for years according to the boss of australis oil gas which has exclusive rights to two concessions in the area
portugal is relatively but there is a relatively high success rate chief executive ian lusted told reuters
but to date there have been no sizeable findings and there is no hydrocarbon production at all in the according to the company which won an exploration licence in a total of onshore wells have been drilled in the country so far with the majority being shallow wells of less than metres
however from the wells already drilled in batalha and pombal in central portugal the two concessions owned by the company there are indications of two working hydrocarbon systems
we had independent engineers who assessed that the recoverable volume was about years of supply for the whole of portugal lusted said
portugal s natural gas consumption was estimated at billion cubic meters billion cu ft in
this is potentially very beneficial for the country and it ties up with government policy lusted added
the government said early in december it was aiming for renewable energy sources to account for percent of portugal s energy by rising to percent in
environmentalists have expressed concerns about the natural gas project even though it is a cleaner energy source than oil and could be used in a transition period as the country turns to renewables
the drilling in the two areas could start in early but it still has to be assessed by environmental authorities
environmentalists also fear the australian company could use an extraction process known as fracking which has been criticised in some countries for disrupting local communities
lusted denied this saying the company would only be allowed to drill a well and produce it conventionally
in a petition signed by more than people local organisation asmaa wrote that the concessions where australis will drill include areas of high population density and many areas of cultural and historical interest as well as many nature reserves
