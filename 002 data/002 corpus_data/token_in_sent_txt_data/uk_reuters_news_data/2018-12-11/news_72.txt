refile-asian jet fuel discounts slip to 9-yr seasonal low as supply swells
removes extraneous text in paragraph
by koustav samanta singapore dec reuters asian jet fuel price discounts stand at their lowest december levels in nine years as a supply glut offsets consumption even as the region s aviation sector booms
the slump is a mirror image of the steep gains asian aviation fuel price differentials saw in the first quarter of this year
then tight supply lifted them to their highest seasonal levels in a decade
the cash differentials for jet fuel in the asian trading hub of singapore were at a discount of a barrel below benchmark quotes on monday the weakest for this time of year since according to refinitiv eikon data
cash differentials represent the price buyers are prepared to pay for fuel over or below benchmark values published daily by price reporting agencies
clearly the physical market does not believe that the high prices of jet paper contracts are justified said sukrit vijayakar director of energy consultancy trifecta
that is what is causing the weakness in the cash the weakness also comes as winter in the northern hemisphere has seen a mild start the outlook is largely for an unusually mild season because of an el nino weather pattern
that s especially the case in japan where kerosene almost identical to jet fuel is commonly used for heating
the low kerosene consumption and high yields for churning out jet fuel are luring refiners to pump out more of the latter market sources said weighing on the price traders are willing to buy it for
and the low cash prices are starting to weigh on refinery margins traders said
refining margins also known as cracks for jet fuel were at a barrel over dubai crude during asian trading hours on monday down percent in the last four weeks
despite that jet cracks remain comparatively high the peak of a barrel on was a near high and seasonally adjusted refinery cracks for jet fuel are still at their strongest levels for this time of the year since
refiners can take comfort from the fact that aviation demand is really good jet cracks are very high said vijayakar
