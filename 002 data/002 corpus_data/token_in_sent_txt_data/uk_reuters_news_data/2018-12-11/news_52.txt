update 1-france's total sees robust demand for lng from russia's yamal
adds detail quotes comments from russian foreign ministry by katya golubkova sabetta russia dec reuters french oil and gas group total believes there is enough demand on the spot market for liquefied natural gas from its yamal lng plant in russia total s chief executive said on tuesday as the project has expanded ahead of schedule
on tuesday russian prime minister dmitry medvedev attended a ceremony marking the launch of the third train or stage of yamal lng which expanded its annual capacity to million tonnes
the expansion had been initially expected at the end of and a quicker rise in output has raised questions about yamal lng s ability to sell the additional volumes
it has more than percent of its lng production under contracts for the next years
russian gas producer novatek controls yamal lng which is by total china s cnpc and the silk road fund
it started operations in december
total s chief executive patrick pouyanne said yamal lng would start sales under a contract from the third stage of the yamal lng project as initially planned
it is not difficult to sell on the spot market the lng market is growing by pct per year or more so clients are asking for more lng it s not a real issue pouyanne told reporters
we export more lng quicker its good for the project
in fact it is a surprise but the lng trains are ready in front of all the vessels he said
last month an lng tanker transferred a cargo of yamal lng to another vessel off the tip of northern norway the first such operation that will help the facility raise production
this has irked the united states who has said the operations undercut europe s energy diversification efforts
by transferring lng to more conventional tankers in norway the arctic vessels cut in half the distance they would cover to deliver gas to europe enabling more frequent shipments from the novatek terminal and increasing russia s gas exports
russia s foreign ministry in emailed comments to reuters said the operation s aim is to reduce transportation costs calling criticism from the united states unfair and political pressure
