arctic posts second warmest year on record in 2018 -u.s. noaa
reuters the arctic had its year on record in part of a warming trend that may be dramatically changing earth s weather patterns according to a report released on tuesday by the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration
arctic air temperatures for the past five years have exceeded all previous records since according to the annual noaa study the arctic report card which said the year was second only to in overall warmth in the region
it marks the latest in a series of warnings about climate change from government bodies even as president donald trump has voiced scepticism about the phenomenon and has pushed a fuels agenda
the study said the arctic warming continues at about double the rate of the rest of the planet and that the trend appears to be altering the shape and strength of the jet stream air current that influences weather in the northern hemisphere
growing atmospheric warmth in the arctic results in a sluggish and unusually wavy that coincided with abnormal weather events it said noting that the changing patterns have often brought unusually frigid temperatures to areas south of the arctic circle
some examples are a swarm of severe winter storms in the eastern united states in and the extreme cold outbreak in europe in march known as the beast from the environmentalists have long warned of rapid warming in the arctic saying it threatens imperilled species like polar bears and is a harbinger of the broader impacts of climate change on the planet
scientists have warned that the region could suffer trillions of dollars worth of climate damage to infrastructure in the coming decades
but the melting of arctic ice has piqued the interests of polar nations like the united states canada and russia by opening new shipping routes and expanding access to a region believed to be rich in petroleum and minerals
the united states and russia have both expressed an interest in boosting arctic drilling and russia has bolstered its military presence in the north
the noaa report comes weeks after more than a dozen government agencies released a study concluding that climate change is driven by human consumption of fossil fuels and will cost the economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century
trump who has been rolling back environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels said of the update to the national climate assessment i don t believe trump last year announced his intention to withdraw the united states from the paris deal agreed by nearly nations to combat climate change arguing the accord would kill jobs and provide little tangible environmental benefit
