rpt-explainer-how unstable is libya's oil production?
repeats march item with no changes by aidan lewis tunis march reuters two of libya s largest oilfields with combined production of nearly barrels per day bpd have suffered shutdowns in quick succession casting fresh doubt on a partial recovery in the opec member s oil output
libya s national output has been sustained at about one million bpd for months and most recent closures have been quickly resolved
a shutdown that began on sunday at el sharara libya s biggest field lasted less than hours
but the latest disruptions caused by guards at el feel field complaining about pay and benefits and by a property owner who said he wanted rubbish cleared from his land highlight continuing risks to output in a country without centralised security forces or political control
libya has the largest proven reserves of oil in africa and has been a key supplier of light sweet crude to europe
around it produced more than million bpd and before the uprising in which muammar gaddafi was toppled and killed seven years ago it was pumping more than million bpd
last year the national oil corporation noc outlined plans that would raise production to million bpd by but said this would need around billion of investment
foreign oil companies including italy s eni total of france and firms conocophillips and hess have production stakes through joint ventures with the noc
since libya s uprising power in the sparsely populated nation has fragmented and local groups have used oil facilities as bargaining chips to press financial and political demands
armed factions across the country have cut off production at key fields and ports including a long blockade of terminals in libya s eastern oil crescent from
prolonged and haphazard shutdowns have reduced pressure at oil wells
as libya s revenue fell due to production disruptions and lower oil prices demands for salaries local development and jobs that feed into blockades became more widespread
islamic state militants attacked oilfields and ports in before being driven back by local forces
their destruction of storage tanks at two of libya s biggest terminals es sider and ras lanuf has yet to be repaired
fields including mabruk and ghani remain closed
after disputed elections in led to rival governments being set up in tripoli and the east factions tried to sell oil independently
they failed but the split added to uncertainty in libya s oil sector
the causes of recent shutdowns include economic protests by guards armed groups pushing for the release of jailed members and apparent political manoeuvring in the east
sometimes shutdowns are triggered in remote fields or at terminals sometimes by people with access to gearboxes that control pipeline valves
production at the key sharara field has repeatedly been cut on the long pipeline leading to the coast by groups near zintan a western town that became militarily powerful in the uprising
the internationally recognised government of national accord gna in tripoli which lacks authority over armed groups even in the capital often has little means of ending blockades
oil installations are meant to be protected by the petroleum facilities guards pfg
but as with other parts of libya s security forces their official status is effectively and their actions are governed by local interests rather than any central authority
even as longer blockades ended from financial constraints have been an underlying drag on libya s production rebound
the noc has had rocky relations with the gna and has complained repeatedly that budget allocations have been held up
the gna says its own resources are limited
a bigger political risk also looms
factions in the east where most of libya s oil wealth is located are opposed to the gna and say it has not disbursed sufficient oil income to eastern regions
some eastern hardliners have threatened to cut oil production although for now the libyan national army lna which has good relations with the noc in tripoli has kept fields and ports open
security is still volatile
in december an explosion at a pipeline in eastern libya caused an outage of up to bpd though it was quickly repaired
international companies are working offshore but still have a limited presence onshore keeping exploration and development programmes mostly on hold
along with nigeria libya has been exempted from production cuts that seek to bolster crude prices and have been extended until the end of
despite speculation that the two troubled nations would be pressured into joining the deal both have signalled their intention to raise production
