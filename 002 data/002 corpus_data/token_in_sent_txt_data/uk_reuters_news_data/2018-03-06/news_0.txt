update 2-australia, east timor sign deal on maritime border, gas field
united nations reuters east timor and australia signed a treaty at the united nations in new york on tuesday to resolve a dispute over their maritime border and struck a deal on how to share revenue from the offshore greater sunrise gas field
east timor will receive a bigger share of the revenue than australia depending on the development concept percent of the revenue if the gas is piped to the tiny country or percent if the gas is piped to australia for processing
the agreement also establishes a maritime boundary in the timor sea for the first time
australia had sought a boundary aligned with its continental shelf but east timor argued the border should lie half way between it and australia placing much of the greater sunrise field under its control
with this treaty we open a new chapter in relations between australia and said australian foreign minister julie bishop who signed the treaty alongside east timor s deputy minister of the prime minister for the delimitation of borders hermenegildo augusto cabral pereira
the protracted dispute had led the owners of greater sunrise woodside petroleum conocophillips royal dutch shell and japan s osaka gas to shelve the project
the greater sunrise field is estimated to hold trillion cubic feet of gas and million barrels of condensates which analysts have previously estimated could be worth billion
however development could be at least a decade away with woodside looking at the latter half of the next decade
australian associated press reported shortly before the signing ceremony that east timor had accused australia of colluding with the oil companies to have the gas piped to australia for processing
australia rejects absolutely any suggestion that we have acted other than in utmost good faith throughout this conciliation process bishop told reporters at the united nations
the way is now clear for as the majority beneficiary of the division of the resource to find a way with the joint venture partners to develop greater sunrise in an economically viable fashion she said
east timor had been pushing hard for the building of an onshore processing plant to boost its economy
bishop said australia does not have a position and that the main concern was that any project was economically viable
it s a conciliation process it was never meant to be easy
we had ups and downs in this months said pereira adding that the focus should be on tuesday s treaty signing
ending years of opposition australia agreed in to accept dili s formal notice to terminate an agreement to split petroleum revenue equally from greater sunrise and set a timetable for negotiating a permanent sea boundary
dili had taken the maritime border dispute to the permanent court of arbitration an intergovernmental organization based at the hague which ordered compulsory arbitration between the two parties
