update 2-diesel collapse gives automakers carbon headache
geneva reuters the accelerating demise of diesel long used by carmakers to boost is undermining their plans to meet looming european union goals and avoid big annual fines
executives gathered on tuesday at the geneva auto show are grappling with unpalatable choices existing vehicles at huge expense restrict sales of some profitable models or risk hundreds of millions of euros in penalties
others are clinging to the hope that the image of the latest euro diesels may yet be rehabilitated and their fortunes restored
i am worried volkswagen chief executive matthias mueller said in a reuters television interview
but it s our job to solve these problems he said
i m firmly convinced that diesel will experience a but a fresh flurry of bad headlines and the growing prospect of outright diesel vehicle bans are already sending their sales into a steeper tailspin
while diesels produce more toxic nitrogen oxides nox and particulates than gasoline engines their efficiency has been instrumental in cutting greenhouse gases
as consumers shun diesels more carmakers are on track to miss tougher eu carbon dioxide goals taking effect in
some industry insiders predict carmakers will be forced to rein in sales of larger models by raising prices to avoid overshooting the eu s target
ford is reviewing its european in light of diesel s slide and is likely to restrict the sale of some vehicles that push us over the limit a company source said
steven armstrong the carmaker s head of european operations played down that prospect
we re not having to rethink the model he said
of course we ll have to the volume by powertrain by vehicle but it s not going to be a fundamental shift for vw brand sales chief juergen stackmann told reuters his business would have to consider price increases for larger models restricting sales
we are required to be compliant with eu targets which steps are necessary will become clear in years
a significantly lower mix of diesels is not helpful he said
initially sparked by vw s emissions scandal and subsequent studies exposing the true levels of nox emissions the diesel slump has since deepened rather than stabilizing as mueller and others had hoped it would
sales of diesel cars fell percent in europe last year reducing their market share to percent from a percent peak in
partly as a result average emissions increased in europe in for the first time in a decade according to researchers jato dynamics
that was before the latest pr setbacks in which vw admitted using monkeys and humans to test exhaust gas and a court ruled that german cities were free to ban older diesel cars joining paris london and a host of other urban centers that have vowed to run them off the road
diesel sales were down another percent in germany last month and a whopping percent in britain amid concern that the decline in values would give way to collapse
french carmakers which have relied heavily on diesels to meet goals are now scrambling for alternatives
renault has stepped up development of a hybrid known as locobox but the powertrain won t even begin rolling out until
psa group chief executive carlos tavares insisted last week the peugeot maker remained on track
in a newspaper interview the same day however he urged governments to suspend penalties for until electric car charging networks are better developed
tavares said on tuesday he would seek backing for his demands from europe s acea car industry lobby group which he currently chairs
hybrids being rushed out across the peugeot citroen and newly acquired opel are not expected to arrive before under current plans
it s not just at psa that it s happening too late it s happening too late everywhere said philippe houchois a automotive analyst with investment bank jefferies
the cost of compliance is one of the potential triggers of the next auto recession houchois said
manufacturers are going to have to raise prices on larger petrol cars to meet their emissions targets and that s going to hit sales already last october investment research house msci was warning that all carmakers apart from toyota are at risk of missing regulatory targets for fleet emissions in
the japanese carmaker is dropping diesels from its european fleet as it benefits from two decades of dominance in hybrids
fiat chrysler is expected to announce a diesel in its plan due in june
german premium automakers are also better resourced to absorb the shock by ramping up sales of hybrids already in their portfolios or pipelines while rushing out technology to curb emissions across existing model lineups including the mercedes
but the strategy of leaning on costly for compliance has limits as well as profitability perils
bmw admits it is already taking a hit on the hybrid version of its suv priced euros below the diesel version at euros despite its higher cost
the profitability of hybrids is below that of cars with pure combustion engines a company spokesman said
that spells bigger trouble for volume brands which lack the lucrative luxury models to offset compliance cars sold at lower profit or even a loss to meet goals
if everybody wants to sell a lot of electrified vehicles the prices are going to collapse said one psa group engineer
