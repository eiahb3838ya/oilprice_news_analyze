update 1-mexico looks for more jamaican oil ties, possible caribbean model -minister
adds details on oil cooperation petrocaribe and mexico background by john myers kingston march reuters mexico is looking into ways to deepen energy cooperation with jamaica foreign minister luis videgaray said on tuesday on a caribbean trip to promote efforts to erode venezuela s diplomatic influence
videgaray said he was hoping to get more mexican firms to come to jamaica as suppliers of oil and as potential investors in developing jamaican oil resources
last month secretary of state rex tillerson announced that mexico canada and the united states were looking at how to mitigate the effect sanctions on venezuela would have in the caribbean
videgaray who visited lucia before jamaica said deeper energy ties could serve as a model elsewhere in the island region
whatever we do in jamaica can be a learning experience for what we do with other caribbean countries he said without directly mentioning efforts to weaken venezuela s support among countries grateful for past oil largesse
while jamaica no longer imports venezuelan crude it was a founding member of the south american nation s petrocaribe program that provided cheap loans for oil to caribbean nations
the legacy of the program has helped venezuela win votes in the organization of american states to defeat motions against president nicolas maduro whose socialist government has overseen an economic crisis in venezuela
mexico s oil output has fallen sharply and the energy ministry has said it would be difficult for the country to replace petrocaribe
we are a economy and any kind of cooperation that we do and any business that we foster is according to market principles said videgaray standing next to his jamaican counterpart kamina johnson smith
he added mexico would be signing a memorandum of understanding to provide technical support to jamaica s oil refinery petrojam which is jointly owned by a unit of venezuelan national oil company pdvsa
jamaica already buys spot cargos of crude from mexico a major oil supplier to the united states
mexico has been gradually opening up its oil sector following a constitutional reform in that ended decades of monopoly control by national oil company pemex
its ability to maximize crude processing has been hobbled however by little new investment accidents and natural disasters
