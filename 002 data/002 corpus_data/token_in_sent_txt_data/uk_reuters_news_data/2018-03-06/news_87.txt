trump's tariff threat may be timed for pennsylvania u.s. house race
washington march reuters president donald trump has alarmed the republican establishment and world leaders by threatening tough steel tariffs a message that might be meant not just to shake the world trade order but to help defend a congressional seat in pennsylvania
some republican strategists said trump s tariff threat appeared to be timed at least in part to sway voters in the steel country of pennsylvania including its district where republican rick saccone and democrat conor lamb are facing off
in a special election on march the two will vie to replace republican tim murphy who resigned in october in a sex scandal
if saccone loses it would be a blow to trump the first loss by republicans of a seat in the house of representatives since he took office in january
the results will not affect republican control of the chamber
trump has endorsed saccone and is scheduled to visit the pittsburgh area on saturday for a campaign event
saccone met trump on arrival for a similar event in january
republican strategist ford o connell said trump s stance on steel and aluminum tariffs could help republicans not only in southwestern pennsylvania but across the industrial midwest
the timing definitely helps saccone o connell said
the district covers steel farm and coal country on the west virginia border as well as pittsburgh suburbs
trump won the district by nearly points in the november presidential election helping him carry the pivotal battleground state
but in recent political races in other states democrats upset by trump policies have been energized to turn out to vote
in the pennsylvania race lamb is rising in the polls and is neck and neck with saccone who has said i was trump before trump was peter navarro the white house trade and manufacturing policy director defended trump s trade plan on fox business network s varney show on monday
of course if you go to ohio or pennsylvania or you go to the heartland of american main street there s universal support he said
trump threatened to impose percent steel and percent aluminum tariffs in an announcement on thursday prompting a steep stock and expressions of concern about a possible trade war from washington to foreign capitals
establishment republicans should not be surprised that trump is following through on his campaign pledge said chris barron a republican strategist
if republicans are going to hold on to the majority in the house they need to hold on in places like pennsylvania
this is a winner he said adding the rally on saturday would be good for trump who will get positive feedback from the crowd
it s going to be hard to talk the president back from that because he s going to feel that support from those grassroots voters barron said
democrats said the tariff issue would likely be a factor in the district race but one that would cut two ways
pennsylvania democratic strategist mike mikus said the issue of steel tariffs is a very popular idea here in western pennsylvania
however i don t believe it will be enough to help rick saccone in this election
i don t view it as a because the issue has been championed by democrats for so republican strategist mike devanney said tariff rhetoric may help saccone but that any boost could be muted in the diverse district
he added that the president s comments could backfire
it s not without risks in equally energizing lamb s base devanney said
president trump is obviously a figure who can energize and divide depending on who s writing by kevin drawbaugh and peter cooney
