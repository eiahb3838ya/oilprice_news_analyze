shrinking gas giant engie eyes deals to stem earnings loss
paris reuters french power utility engie is looking at big acquisitions that will generate cash in a strategy switch following the sale of billion euros of assets that have shrunk its earnings base according to two sources close to the company
between and engie s revenue fell by a third from billion euros billion to billion and analysts expect it to have dropped further during
over the same period core earnings have slumped from billion euros in to a forecast billion euros at end
engie s stock has followed the same pattern dropping more than percent from highs
its billion market value puts the top european utility way behind peers iberdrola and enel worth billion and billion respectively
new engie ceo isabelle kocher appointed in may has reinvested part of the proceeds from sales of fossil fuel related assets in a string of smaller renewable energy power grids and energy services assets
but the acquisitions have not made up for the lost earnings so far and investors are hoping to get more clarity on engie s strategy at the release of earnings on thursday
with the stock price lower than when she took charge kocher is cautiously considering bigger deals in a bid to restore earnings flow and regain investor confidence the sources said
a source close to the board told reuters that management is presenting potential major acquisitions to the board every three months
the last such meeting took place at the end of
selling the assets has blown a hole in the earnings and it is not going to be filled with renewables so kocher is on the lookout for an acquisition the source said
the sources declined to name possible acquisition targets but bankers said dutch utility eneco could prove attractive
eneco s owners want to pursue a private sale to another industry player in coming months reuters has reported
engie declined to comment
an investment banker who has worked on several deals for engie said the arrival of solvay ceo clamadieu who will take over as chairman of engie s board in may could speed up the switch in strategy
the way engie is run may change in coming months
engie has to do something big he said
shortly after he was nominated in february clamadieu said on french tv that kocher s strategy was coherent but that engie needed to identify growth engines and consider external growth
a first wave of asset sales in was aimed at reducing debt but kocher s strategy is to sell and reinvest
by late engie had completed nearly percent of her divestment plan with the sale of its upstream liquefied natural gas assets for billion its oil and gas exploration and production business for billion and the loy yang b power station in australia for million
how engie has reinvested or will reinvest the proceeds of the sales and how much cash is left is less clear
while asset sales were big chunks counted in billions acquisitions have been mainly counted in millions like the million euro for solar energy firm solairedirect and the million for percent in dubai firm tabreed
last year in may sources said germany s rwe and engie had studied the possibility of rwe swapping its renewables and grids unit innogy in exchange for a stake in engie
