peugeot boss demands government commitments on electric-car charging networks
geneva reuters psa group boss carlos tavares said he will introduce demands that eu governments commit to develop networks in exchange for previously agreed emissions goals taking effect in backed by heavy fines
in what could be the start of a pushback against the agreed carbon emissions targets by the main acea european carmakers lobby tavares who currently chairs the acea said he would propose the new demands to its board this week
i think it s only logical that there should be commitments from governments tavares told reporters at the geneva auto show
the potential suspension of penalties if charging network rollouts fall short of targets is to be discussed he added
in a newspaper interview last week tavares suggested carmakers should not be fined for if the density of charging networks remained inadequate
the accelerating decline of diesel long used by carmakers to boost is undermining carmakers efforts to meet the looming goals and avoid big penalties
