skirting saudi arms sales, france says iran has "lots" of weapons in yemen
paris reuters france s foreign minister on tuesday sidestepped questions on whether his country should end weapons sales to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates because they were being used in yemen saying that iran also had lots of weapons there
the kingdom is leading a coalition formed in to fight the houthi group that controls most of northern yemen and the capital sanaa in a war that has killed more than people and displaced more than three million
the french administration under president emmanuel macron has drawn criticism in particular from rights groups over its support of the kingdom s actions and allowing weapons it has sold to riyadh potentially to be used in its yemen operations
when asked specifically why france continued to sell weapons to saudi and the emirates in the current context le drian skirted the issue and said the priority was to find a political solution to the yemen crisis
i m really worried by the situation in yemen le drian told parliament s foreign affairs committee
it s an absurd war
it s true that there are saudi weapons but would you believe it there are iranian weapons too lots of them iran has denied supplying the houthis weapons
the two gulf arab states are among france s main weapons clients receiving tanks armoured vehicles munitions artillery and in the case of the emirates fighter jets
unlike some european states paris has shown no concrete signs of reducing or suspending sales to the coalition despite warnings that some of its weapons could be used in the war in yemen sources aware of the issue have said
however paris has grown increasingly concerned by the worsening humanitarian situation and in december macron called for a complete lifting of a saudi blockade on yemen
the problem is the sovereignty of the states that commit their own armies to an absurd conflict and we hope that we will quickly start the political solution because it is probably the crisis in the region that would be easiest to resolve if there was the political will on all reporting by john irish editing by william maclean
