papua new guinea aid workers race to deliver supplies as aftershocks strike
reuters aid workers struggled to reach remote areas of papua new guinea s rugged highlands on tuesday as aftershocks rattled the region more than a week after a powerful magnitude earthquake killed dozens of people
two aftershocks above magnitude hit the mountainous southern highlands about km miles northwest of the capital port moresby with the constant shaking driving people from their homes to makeshift shelters for fear of landslides
local media outlets on tuesday reported the death toll had grown to after government officials said previously that people had been killed
james komengi a united church project officer speaking from tari the capital of hela province said his church s assessment and response centre had counted up to deaths in that province alone
mothers and children are so traumatised
even my own children are refusing to sleep in our house
every little movement scares them said komengi
concerns were also growing about access to safe drinking water after the shaking destroyed many water tanks while land slips had poured mud into natural water sources
because of the landslides it s very dirty water said udaya regmi director the international red cross in papua new guinea
provincial health officials and red cross volunteers were urgently trying to improve sanitation systems and carry out hygeine training to avoid an outbreak of dystentry regmi said
local hospitals had seen a number of people with stomach conditions but it was not yet confirmed whether these were due to contaminated water he added

the logistics are still a massive problem said anna bryan an aid worker for care australia based in the capital port moresby
australia new zealand and the red cross have all pledged aid although reaching the remote area has proved difficult as forbidding terrain and bad weather as well as damaged roads and runways have delayed aid efforts
right now the main challenge in the affected areas is accessibility by roads
there are big cracks along the roads and even roads completely cut off
so that s making it quite difficult to get water food and medicine to the remote areas said milton kwaipo caritas australia s disaster response and management officer in papua new guinea
the quake has also been felt on global gas markets with exxonmobil corp declaring force majeure on exports from papua new guinea according to an industry source pushing up asian spot liquefied natural gas lng prices
the company declined to comment on the force majeure but said it would take about weeks to restore production
