update 2-ceraweek-global oil sector needs $20 tln investments over 25 years -aramco ceo
houston reuters the global oil and gas industry needs to invest more than trillion trillion pounds over the next years to meet expected growth in demand and compensate for the natural decline in developed fields saudi aramco chief executive officer amin nasser said on tuesday
speaking at the ceraweek conference in houston nasser said the industry has already lost trillion of investments since the oil price downturn from to
future investments needed will only come if investors are convinced that oil will be allowed to compete on a level playing field that oil is worth so much more and that oil is here for the foreseeable future nasser said
that is why we must push back on the idea that the world can do without proven and reliable sources
we must challenge mistaken assumptions about the speed with which alternatives will penetrate he noted that about percent of passenger vehicles on the road use internal combustion engines even hybrid vehicles and said electricity produced for vehicles comes through power generation which is still dominated by coal particularly in markets like india and china
nasser said that even with the growth of electric vehicles increased demand from petrochemical markets over the next two decades will necessitate additional investment and need for crude oil
he noted even conservative estimates suggest the need for about million barrels per day of new capacity in the next five years
he said he was confident that oil market fundamentals and future demand growth would be healthy despite significant oil price volatility and forecasts of rising shale oil production
nasser only briefly referenced the plans for saudi aramco to go public saying it is proceeding very well but the company s shareholder the saudi government will ultimately decide when and where it will be listed
the company is expected to list the ipo domestically but there is significant jockeying between new york london and hong kong for a potential second listing
hong kong is emerging as an increasingly likely compromise according to two sources familiar with the matter
the decision on the venue must be taken by march or april at latest if the ipo is to list in october or november or it could be delayed until sources familiar with the ipo discussions have said
nasser speaking in houston did not comment specifically on the timeline
