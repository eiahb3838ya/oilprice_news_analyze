the automaker which makes just under one in three of britain s million cars at three factories is building its new electric model in austria

london and brussels hope to agree on a transitional deal this month to maintain free and unfettered trade until at least the end of ahead of a brexit agreement to be decided by the end of the year
speth cited the need for support from government and academia but when asked whether brexit was a factor in the process he said we are waiting for these kinds of decisions
