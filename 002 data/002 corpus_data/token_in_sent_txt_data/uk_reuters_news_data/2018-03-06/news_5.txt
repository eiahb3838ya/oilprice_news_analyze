ceraweek-energy execs says tariff gambit could hit shale, lng project costs
houston reuters energy executives say the trump administration s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs could bump up the cost of projects needed for rapidly rising shale oil and gas output by three to percent
higher construction costs could slow growth in production and exports of crude and natural gas from shale that has made the united states the world s largest gas producer and second largest oil producer
president donald trump s proposal is emerging as a potential spoiler for new pipelines drilling rigs offshore platforms and refineries to handle coming oil and gas production
companies including exxon mobil corp kinder morgan inc and others have outlined tens of billions of dollars of new petrochemical and pipeline expansions in the united states
the administration has not yet formally unveiled its plan
it is unclear whether exemptions would be available for certain sectors or for steel from places such as canada the biggest foreign provider of the metal to the united states
trading partners have said they could counter tariffs with their own levies on exports
if the proposed tariffs were in place when natural gas company freeport lng was building its first three liquefied natural gas lng production lines they would have raised the dollar construction cost by about million or between percent and percent chief executive michael smith said in an interview
freeport lng is in the process of building a fourth production line at the lng plant in texas
steel tariffs would affect the economics of the plant but not deter the company from building it smith said on the sidelines of an industry gathering in houston
if the tariffs lead to a trade war with china then freeport lng could suffer because china is among the buyers for the gas he said
export capacity was less than million tonnes per annum mtpa in and is expected to top mtpa by which would make it the world s no
exporter behind australia
steel accounts for as much as percent of new drilling project costs
while higher costs would not halt new drilling in shale fields it could slow it down jim burkhard vice president of oil research for consultancy ihs markit said in an interview
benchmark steel prices hit a high on monday according to data provider s p global platts
last month turkey s borusan mannesmann said it would provide about half the steel for the gulf coast express pipeline a billion kinder morgan project to move nearly billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the permian to texas gulf coast
kinder morgan declined to comment on the pipeline suppliers
when the proposal was first announced sources at exxon mobil told reuters that increased costs from tariffs could affect the company s plans to build another crude oil distillation unit at its baytown refinery that would make it the largest in the united states
the proposal is part of a billion expansion of several refining and petrochemical complexes along the gulf in coming years
since billion worth of petrochemical projects have been started or completed across the united states
the shale production boom has overcome bigger hurdles including the organization of the petroleum exporting countries efforts to stem its rise a few years ago by flooding the market with oil
energy production is projected to reach million barrels of oil per day in up from an average of million bpd last year ihs estimates
some pipeline projects could be hamstrung if developers can not buy parts made outside of the united states said greg armstrong ceo of energy storage and transport company plains all american pipeline
his firm has about billion in projects on the drawing board and some of the steel required is not made domestically
it s a thornier issue than is printed in the headlines said armstrong
if you can t get what you need you kind of have to go somewhere else outside the united states he said
