update 4-u.s. pushes nafta talks pace, warns of political headwinds
mexico city reuters mexican and officials pushed on monday to speed up nafta negotiations with the united states floating the idea of reaching an agreement in principle in coming weeks to avoid political headwinds later this year
trade representative robert lighthizer showing impatience at the slow pace of the talks said mexico s presidential election and the looming expiry of a congressional negotiating authorization in july put the onus on the united states mexico and canada to come up with a plan soon
we probably have a month or a month and a half or something to get an agreement in principle lighthizer told reporters at the conclusion of a seventh round of talks to overhaul the north american free trade agreement in mexico city
he was speaking after meeting mexican economy minister ildefonso guajardo and canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland for a joint event marked by a more cordial mood than in previous rounds despite major disagreements over president donald trump s plan to impose steel tariffs
trump has threatened to dump nafta unless it boosts manufacturing and employment arguing the accord has caused the migration of jobs and factories southward to mexico
guajardo told reporters the three countries aimed to hold discussions on nafta over the next five weeks before an eighth round probably in early april
during that period he and his two counterparts also aimed to meet to narrow differences on the most complex issues in the talks which include agreeing on new auto content rules a mechanism and agricultural market access
lighthizer said time to rework the deal was running very short and again raised the possibility of the united states pursuing bilateral deals with its partners albeit stressing that his government would prefer a agreement
he said the united states was making more headway with its southern neighbor than with canada
freeland declined to give details on a prospective timeline for the next round and said alongside lighthizer that trump s plan to impose a percent tariff on steel imports and a percent tariff on aluminum imports was unacceptable
the trade promotion authority or tpa is authorized by congress and is needed to implement legislation for new trade agreements such as the renegotiation of nafta
the tpa expires on july and analysts expect it to be extended
the united states also holds congressional elections in november
early on monday the president ratcheted up tension before the ministerial meetings in mexico by tweeting that tariffs on steel and aluminum will only come off if new fair nafta agreement is lighthizer said that meant canada and mexico would enjoy tariff exemptions once a nafta deal was reached calling the tariffs an incentive to conclude the talks
canada and mexico say they should be exempted from such moves and have warned they could retaliate
guajardo said there would be no concessions made in the nafta negotiations to placate trump on steel and aluminum while freeland said the two issues were separate
guajardo urged all sides however to avoid a trade war and said mexico would wait for a decision
if the united states did impose tariffs a response should be tailored to the sector in question to avoid complicating other issues he added
contaminating strategies just ends up making you escalate the nature of the conflicts guajardo said
talks to overhaul the pact are moving slowly in part because canada and mexico have resisted demands to boost the north american content of autos produced inside nafta
when asked about the discussions on the rules of origin for autos guajardo noted that no trade deal could depend only on the interests of one particular sector
although mexico holds its election in july it will not change governments until december and guajardo pledged to keep negotiating for as as long as necessary while president enrique pena nieto s administration is in office
lighthizer said only six chapters had been concluded since talks began in august
negotiators are working on chapters overall he said including a new one on energy
uncertainty over the talks and the potential for a wider global trade war are making investors nervous
during the latest round negotiators concluded talks on rules governing food safety and animal health good regulatory practices plus administration and publication officials said
