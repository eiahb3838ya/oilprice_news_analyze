french hydro firm builds wind turbines as swiss glaciers melt
paris reuters french hydropower firm cnr anticipating the impact of climate change and the possible disappearance of glaciers in the swiss alps plans to sharply increase its solar and wind capacity to compensate for lower water levels on the rhone river
the rhone running from lake geneva to the french mediterranean is one of europe s biggest rivers but also one of the most exposed to climate change as it is fed mainly by alpine glaciers which are shrinking due to global warming
an exceptional drought last year reduced water flow by percent and reduced electricity production at the compagnie nationale du rhone cnr hydropower group by the same percentage to terawatthours compared to twh in record year
some scientists forecast the rhone s flow to fall by to percent in coming decades and also see more violent swings in flow rates as droughts alternate with floods
scientists say the alps glaciers could disappear by the end of the century
that does not mean they will but we must act responsibly cnr ceo elisabeth ayrault told reuters on the sidelines of a briefing for energy reporters
to make up for this cnr plans to boost its renewables capacity
our plan is to have as much capacity away from the river as on the river probably by she said
cnr has megawatt mw of hydropower capacity making it france s hydropower producer after edf and has already built some mw of mainly wind and some solar power since
by it wants to boost that to mw and then accelerate renewables investment with a further mw in to eventually reach mw of renewables capacity
ayrault said the problem was not just slower flow rates but also increasing volatility
last year s drought was followed by three major floods in
floods also weigh on output as cnr is forced to open dams to evacuate excess water
what is worrying is the huge swings in river flow
we no longer have the regularity we had before she said
ayrault said the irregular flow also affects other industries such as nuclear energy agriculture and shipping
in the past months france twice had to ask switzerland to increase the outflow of lake geneva to ensure sufficient cooling water for the bugey nuclear plant she said
owned percent by gas utility engie percent by state financial group caisse des depots and percent by local authorities cnr accounts for percent of french hydropower output and has a monopoly on rhone river hydropower under a concession that runs till
