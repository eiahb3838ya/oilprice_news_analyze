rpt-graphic-president trump can't stop u.s. coal plants from retiring
repeats to widen distribution by scott disavino jan reuters more power plants were shut in president donald trump s first two years than were retired in the whole of barack obama s first term despite the republican s efforts to prop up the industry to keep a campaign promise to states
in total more than megawatts mw of generation were shut in versus mw in according to data from reuters and the energy information administration eia
trump has tried to roll back rules on climate change and the environment adopted during the obama administration to fulfill pledges to voters in states like west virginia and wyoming
but the second highest year for coal shutdowns was in trump s second year at around megawatts following a peak at about megawatts in under obama
one megawatt can power about homes
the number of coal plants has continued to decline every year since coal capacity peaked at just over mw in and is expected to keep falling as consumers demand power from cleaner and less expensive sources of energy
cheap natural gas and the rising use of renewable power like solar and wind have kept electric prices relatively low for years making it uneconomic for generators to keep investing in older coal and nuclear plants
generators said they plan to shut around mw of power and mw of nuclear in while adding mw of wind mw of solar and mw of gas according to reuters and eia data
the predictions come from estimates compiled by thomson reuters and energy information administration data

since taking office in january the trump administration has announced its intention to leave the paris agreement on climate change and is relaxing rules on emissions from power plants as it seeks to boost domestic production of oil gas and coal
emissions of carbon dioxide the main greenhouse gas spiked in after falling for the previous three years as cold weather spurred gas demand for heating and the booming economy pushed planes and trucks to guzzle fuel according to a study by rhodium group an independent research group
after falling to million tonnes in the lowest since the eia projected carbon emissions will rise to million tonnes in
there will be a limit to what increasingly cheap renewable power and continuously cheap natural gas can deliver with respect to emissions reductions said john larsen a director at rhodium group who leads the firm s power sector research noting the rising use of gas to produce power as coal plants shut
natural gas emits about half the carbon as coal
the trump administration has also tried to slow the retirement of coal and nuclear plants through a directive in from energy secretary rick perry to subsidize the aging units because they make the electric grid more resilient
that plan was bashed by advocates for gas renewable power and consumers and unanimously rejected by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc led by former chairman kevin mcintyre
the plan could resurface now that trump has a chance to replace mcintyre who died on
