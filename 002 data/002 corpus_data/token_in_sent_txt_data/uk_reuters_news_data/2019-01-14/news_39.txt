from tibet to the 'nine dragons', vietnam's mekong delta is losing sand
mo cay vietnam reuters in the dead of night the entire front half of shopkeeper ta thi kim anh s house collapsed
perched on the sandy banks of the mekong river it took just a few minutes for one half of everything she owned to plunge into its murky depths
our kitchen our laundry room our two bedrooms all gone said kim anh speaking amongst the twisted metal and rubble of her house from which she still sells eggs soap and instant noodles to villagers in ben tre a province in vietnam s mekong delta region
we d be better off living in a cave instead said kim anh who has used coconut husks and old tires to reinforce the riverbank under her home
upstream damming and extensive mining of the mekong s riverbed for sand is causing the land between the sprawling network of rivers and channels near the mouth of one of the world s great rivers to sink at a pace of around cm inches a year experts and officials said
the km river known as the lancang in its upper reaches flows from china s tibetan plateau along the borders of myanmar laos and thailand through cambodia and finally vietnam where it forms the delta known in vietnam as the nine dragons
reuters visited three provinces straddling different branches of the delta where it has supported farming and fishing communities for millennia
across the region local authorities are struggling with a rapid pace of erosion that is destroying homes and threatening livelihoods in the southeast asian country s largest region
a key cause is the years of upstream damming in cambodia laos and china that has removed crucial sediment local officials and experts said
that sediment vital for checking the mighty mekong s currents has also been lost due to an insatiable demand for sand a key ingredient in concrete and other construction materials in vietnam that has created a market both at home and abroad for unregulated mining
it s not a problem of the lack of water it s the lack of sediment said duong van ni an expert on the mekong river at the college of natural resources management of can tho university the largest city in the mekong delta region
at this time of year the waters of the mekong used to flow into vietnam as a crawl locals and officials said
now the river runs clear
and without fresh sediment from upstream the deeper riverbed creates stronger currents which in turn eat away at the banks of the mekong where those who rely on the river for their livelihoods have their homes
the problems began when china built its first hydropower plants in the upper mekong basin said ni at can tho university
that left laos cambodia and thailand as the main source of sediment for the mekong in vietnam he said
sand mining in cambodia boomed over the last years fueled in part by demand from wealthy but cramped singapore where it is used to reclaim land along its coast and culminating in a government ban of all cambodian sand exports in under pressure from environmental groups
hydroelectric projects have continued however
earlier this month cambodian prime minister hun sen opened a million hydroelectric dam in stung treng province near the border with laos built by companies from china cambodia and vietnam
the new dam is the southeast asian country s biggest hydroelectric project to date and will have a catastrophic impact on fisheries and biodiversity in the mekong river environmental groups have said
hun sen has dismissed criticism of the project which he says benefits cambodia and its people
since china built hydropower plants new sand almost never reaches us said ni
if we use up the sand we have here there will be no more
china s foreign ministry said in response to reuters questions that it pays great attention to the concerns and needs of downstream countries on the mekong adding that its regulation of water flows from hydro dams has already become an important instrument in preventing floods and droughts
singapore s ministry of national development said in a statement emailed to reuters the city state imports sand on a commercial basis from various countries
we have stringent controls to ensure that suppliers obtain sand in accordance with the source country s laws and regulations it said
regional officials in southwest china s yunnan province have defended the building of dams on the mekong there as fully legally compliant
downstream however the problem is made worse by thieves who illegally mine for sand usually at night
the unlicensed sand miners are very quick and devious nguyen quang thuong vice head of ben tre province s agriculture department told reuters in a recent interview
they escape very fast so having groups of local people helping out the authorities is very one such group in ben tre some of whom are as old as have been using homemade weapons such as slingshots and rudimentary catapults to drive the sand thieves away
we patrol and in the first few months we managed to get rid of percent of the thieves said nam lai one of the group
since none of them dare to go near our shore
still activists and environmental groups worry that on the mekong which runs through six countries with competing needs to exploit the river s hydroelectric potential the damage has already been done
pianporn deetes at the international rivers campaign group who has worked on the mekong for two decades said there was a lack of political will among the countries that share the river to acknowledge the impact of such projects
without the recognition of the existing problems i don t think there is any hope she said
