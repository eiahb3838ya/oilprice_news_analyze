rpt-column-diesel futures point to economic slowdown in 2019: kemp
repeats column that ran on friday with no changes chartbook by john kemp london jan reuters by the end of last year hedge fund positions in diesel had fallen to a level normally associated with a sharp slowdown in economic growth if not an outright recession
most middle distillate fuels such as diesel gasoil and jet fuel are consumed in freight transport ships trucks railroads and air cargo as well as manufacturing and mining
middle distillate consumption and prices are therefore more closely tied to the state of the economy than other refined fuels such as gasoline
for the last years hedge funds and other speculators collectively termed traders have mostly held a net long or bullish position in distillate futures and options
the typical net long position reflects the overall expansion of the and global economies expansions have been long while recessions have been relatively short
in most cases when traders have switched to a substantial net short or bearish position the economy has been experiencing a sharp slowdown or is already in recession
large net short positions in and were all associated with slowdowns or recessions according to contemporary statements or minutes from the federal reserve s open market committee
the exception was the net short position at the end of which came six months after the fed noted a soft patch in the expansion by which time the economy was improving enough for the fed to raise interest rates again
crucially not all these episodes ended in a recession some were transient slowdowns in an uninterrupted expansion
but given this history the large liquidation of speculative long positions in diesel futures during the fourth quarter of was consistent with a substantial deterioration in the economic outlook
traders started with a record bullish position in diesel futures equivalent to million barrels of fuel with more bullish positions held in options and european derivatives such as gasoil
at the start of the fourth quarter they still held a very large net long position equivalent to almost million barrels suggesting most speculators continued to anticipate a strong economic expansion
but the net long position had disappeared by the end of november and turned into a net short of million barrels by the middle of december coinciding with the slump in equity markets and fears about the economic outlook
unfortunately there is no more recent data on positions because of the partial shutdown of the federal government
by the middle of december the net short position was not yet at a level signalling a slowdown or recession but the trend was clear
the fall in diesel positions was consistent with other indicators of slackening economic activity including the decline in equity prices yield curve inversion business surveys and slowing freight growth
at the end of the distillate market like other financial markets and the economy was balanced uncertainly on the brink of a slowdown
what happens next depends critically on whether the and global economies accelerate again settle into an extended soft patch or slump into recession
if the rate of economic expansion quickens again hedge funds and other speculators will close some of their short positions and rebuild a significant net long position exerting upward pressure on diesel and crude prices
the process may already have started in recent days as traders become more optimistic the united states and china will reach an agreement or at least a truce in their trade war
but if the economy settles into a more sluggish phase or stalls and slips into recession further hedge fund selling will put renewed downward pressure on diesel and crude
