antarctica's melt quickens, risks metres of sea level rise-study
oslo reuters antarctica s annual ice losses have accelerated in the past years in a trend that could push sea levels metres higher in coming centuries amid global warming scientists said on monday
they said the east antarctic ice sheet is thawing at the fringes and adding to rising seas unlike many past reports which have concluded that the eastern sheet has so far resisted a melt seen on the western side
ice losses from the frozen continent surged to a net billion tonnes a year in the period from an average billion tonnes from according to the study in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences pnas
overall the scientists said that the melt of antarctica added water equivalent to millimetres inch of sea level rise over the past four decades
that s just the tip of the iceberg so to speak said eric rignot a professor of earth system science at the university of california irvine who led other scientists in france the netherlands and the united states
as the antarctic ice sheet continues to melt away we expect sea level rise from antarctica in the coming centuries with continued global warming he wrote in a statement
global sea levels have risen about centimetres inches in the past century and many other studies have shown a faster thaw from greenland to antarctica threatening coasts from bangladesh to florida and cities from london to shanghai
the pnas study estimated that antarctica lost billion tonnes of ice from above the billion tonnes in the same period estimated last year by a large international team of researchers
the gap was mainly because the pnas study estimated that east antarctica lost billion tonnes over the period compared to a billion tonne gain in last year s estimates
ice sheets can gain mass if snowfall exceeds losses of ice
michiel van den broeke a professor of polar meteorology at utrecht university said the thaw of wilkes land in east antarctica was an emerging area of science
it s extremely important to find out what is happening there he told reuters
antarctica contains enough ice to raise global sea levels by metres if it ever all melted a process that would require far higher temperatures than now and thousands of years
