update 2-eu ready to accept deal to exempt duties on argentine biodiesel
brussels reuters the european commission is willing to accept a deal with producers of argentine biodiesel to settle a trade dispute over imports of the product into europe
the commission which oversees trade policy in the european union said it had communicated to interested parties last week that it was willing to accept undertakings from producers that they would sell at a minimum price
this would exclude these producers from possible duties to be imposed by the european commission while restoring the level playing field for european producers a commission spokesperson said by email on monday
those interested parties have until friday to comment on the proposal with eu countries due to be consulted on the issue on
the deadline for definite duties which are typically in place for five years is
a lawyer representing one of the parties in the case said the commission had not made clear what the minimum price would be nor what potential volume would be allowed in
the scheme with a minimum price would mirror that used to allow chinese solar panel producers to export to the bloc after a major dispute over alleged dumping that threatened to spiral into a trade war
for argentine biodiesel the commission has proposed duties of between and percent depending on the companies a document seen by reuters in december showed
exporters include the argentine arms of bunge ltd cargill inc and louis dreyfus corp as well as molinos rio de la plata sa
we would be willing to settle for a minimum value said luis zubizarreta president of the argentine chamber of biofuels carbio
there is a good dialogue with the eu and it seems like the way to benefit everyone zubizarreta added
an argentine industry source with knowledge of the relationships told reuters that if successful the agreement would be implemented from february and last for several the commission began investigating argentine as well as indonesian biodiesel imports in following a request by eu producers of fuels made from vegetable and recycled oil
the eu case was based on export duties both countries impose on the raw material soybeans for argentina and palm oil for indonesia
the eu view was that this gave an unfair advantage to biodiesel producers there allowing them to sell at unfairly low prices
it imposed duties in but then had to remove most in march after successful challenges at the world trade organization and the european court of justice
the commission opened its current investigation a year ago
