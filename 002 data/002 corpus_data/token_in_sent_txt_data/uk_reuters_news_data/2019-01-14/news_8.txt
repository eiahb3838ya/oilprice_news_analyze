update 2-fca reviewing italy plan after new taxes for polluting cars
detroit reuters fiat chrysler automobiles nv is reviewing its investment plan for italy after the country approved taxes on the purchase of larger gasoline and diesel cars chief executive officer mike manley said on monday
the carmaker said in late november it would spend more than billion euros billion on new models and engines in italy over the next three years to try to make better use of factories and boost jobs and margins
in december however italy approved measures to offer subsidies of up to euros to buyers of new vehicles while introducing taxes on the larger gasoline and diesel cars
it certainly means it needs to be reviewed again
it s being reviewed at this moment manley told journalists on the sidelines of the detroit auto show
until that review is finished i can t comment any fca s italian plans were intended to deliver on a strategy outlined by late boss sergio marchionne in june when he committed to keep converting italian plants to churn out alfa romeos jeeps and maseratis as well as hybrid and electric vehicles to protect jobs and lift profit
manley said tariffs imposed by president donald trump s administration on steel and aluminum imports would add between million and million in extra costs for fca in
he said the partial government shutdown over spending for a wall sought by republican trump on the border has delayed final certification of one of fca s pickup trucks
pickup trucks are the one of most profitable segments in the auto industry and are a major profit driver for fca as it battles for market share against general motors co and ford motor co
so i am concerned clearly
very concerned manley said
if it the shutdown continues it will have an impact on the launch of heavy the earlier it can be resolved clearly the better he added
manley who took the helm at the world s carmaker last year after marchionne s sudden death also said that fca s robotics business comau and castings unit teksid were not for sale at the moment
i m focused on building value in those businesses
if i m able to do that that s going to give me options in the future he said
fca last year agreed to sell its biggest parts maker magneti marelli to japan s calsonic kansei owned by private equity firm kkr for billion euros
that sparked renewed speculation that the smaller comau and teksid businesses could also go especially after attracting interest from potential buyers in the past
one thing i learned in you should never say never manley said
those businesses have value there have been people that have talked to us about those businesses and i ve been interested to hear what they have to reporting by nick carey in detroit writing by agnieszka flak editing by david goodman and matthew lewis
