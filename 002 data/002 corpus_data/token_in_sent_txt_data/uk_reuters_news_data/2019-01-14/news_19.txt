brazil minister blasts supermodel bundchen, invites her to be environment envoy
brasilia reuters brazil s agriculture minister on monday criticized supermodel gisele bundchen for saying brazil is a deforester and said she will invite the supermodel to be an ambassador for the country s efforts to supply the world with food while preserving nature
minister tereza cristina dias said on twitter that bundchen would receive the invitation soon after striking out at her in a radio interview
sorry gisele bundchen you should be our ambassador to say that your country preserves that your country is on the global vanguard of preservation and don t come here saying bad things about brazil without knowledge of the facts dias told sao paulo s jovem pan radio station earlier on monday
press representatives for bundchen did not immediately respond to request for comment
recruiting the supermodel as a spokeswoman for sustainability would be a major public relations coup for the government of president jair bolsonaro which took power by bringing onboard a critic of his predecessor s moves to loosen environmental protections
bundchen who is married to football star tom brady twice squared off with former president michel temer on social media over policies to shrink or eliminate protected areas of the amazon
temer ultimately reversed himself in both cases responding directly to her by twitter in one instance after vetoing rules that would have reduced the size of the jamanxim national forest in brazil s amazon rainforest
environmentalists have blasted the new bolsonaro government warning that it may broadly roll back environmental protections
bolsonaro has said he wants to end an industry of environmental fines which activists say is a major tool for ensuring rules are followed
he has also suggested brazil could exit the paris agreement on climate change
dias tweet followed on the radio interview in which she cited government statistics that brazil has preserved roughly of its native vegetation as evidence of the country s accomplishments in conservation
