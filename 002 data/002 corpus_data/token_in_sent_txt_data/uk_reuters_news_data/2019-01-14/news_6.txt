analysis-'zero coordination': mexico's war on fuel theft risks economic chaos
mexico city reuters conceived as a bold plan to attack corruption a crackdown by mexico s new president on rampant fuel theft has turned into a battle to prevent economic chaos after state governments businesses and consumers were caught out by the decision
eager to purge a prominent stain on mexico s reputation president andres manuel lopez obrador on unveiled a plan to increase military protection of oil installations and began cutting supply from pipelines that have been bled for years by thieves
so far the result has been more than a week of severe fuel shortages shuttered gas stations and lines of motorists snaking around city blocks waiting hours to fill their tanks
the leftist who took office on will score a major victory if he can eradicate the parallel fuel distribution network which the government says has been run largely with the connivance of corrupt employees inside state oil firm pemex
last year alone the theft was worth billion according to government figures
but the pipeline shutdowns which lopez obrador says were drawn up in his early morning security cabinet meetings during december blindsided mexicans when gas stations started to run dry in some of the country s largest cities
officials in three affected states told reuters they were not warned in advance about the supply cuts
there was zero coordination said alejandro guzman head of economic development in the government of jalisco home to the country s city guadalajara
we started to notice when the gas stations began he estimated only a quarter of gas stations in the western half of guadalajara had fuel during the past week
still once the shortages became apparent pemex s new management started to work well with the state to try to address the problem he said
the government spent most of its regular news conference on monday morning discussing the fuel plan
pemex chief executive octavio romero said sales were recovering in affected areas
we ll be back to normal soon lopez obrador said
government officials said three senior pemex executives in charge of pipelines were under investigation over the fuel thefts and that more than a dozen people had had their bank accounts blocked
none of the suspects were named
the haphazard of the plan in which millions of liters of fuel are delivered each day by tanker truck instead of by pipeline is a new test of investor confidence in lopez obrador who rocked markets by cancelling a billion airport five weeks before taking office
a successful crackdown on theft would be welcome news for pemex which as the most indebted oil firm in latin america faces the threat of a credit rating downgrade
for now however pemex is absorbing the higher cost of moving fuel by road
if distribution problems persist industry groups say manufacturing facilities like auto plants could soon idle
the central bank has warned that fuel bottlenecks could stoke inflation and crimp growth in an already slowing economy
already a new black market is emerging for gasoline resold at a premium by people willing to spend the time standing in line
usually bustling food markets in mexico city have quietened down as shoppers and suppliers stay home to conserve fuel
facing reporters every weekday at lopez obrador has taken ownership of the theft crackdown
but his officials have not always agreed on how quickly the crunch will be resolved
calling it the first real domestic crisis of the new administration andres rozental a former deputy foreign minister said the fuel controversy had added to previous question marks about lopez obrador s style of governing
there s not enough communication and not enough coherence in the strategy said rozental a longtime diplomat turned business consultant
given the complexity and cost of protecting thousands of miles of pipeline some analysts believe lopez obrador will have to back down before the theft is fully under control
he says he will only reopen the pipelines when they are secured
polls suggest lopez obrador s base still has his back
a survey of voters by polling firm consulta mitofsky said percent backed his plan while some percent wanted fuel supply returned to normal immediately
lopez obrador won office with just over percent of the vote
some of the worst shortages have been in states
in one the carmaking hub of guanajuato governor diego sinhue told local radio all but of nearly gas stations in leon the biggest city were closed at one point
once a largely peaceful region annual murders in guanajuato leapt more than between and last year to over spurred by turf wars between gangs battling over the pipelines that crisscross the central state
so the government s decision to go after the fuel thieves was welcome said jose arturo sanchez head of the leon chapter of mexico s cce business lobby
but the planning that left drivers stranded he said was totally they didn t consider the consequences he said
in the years i ve lived in leon there s been nothing like as with jalisco sinhue said guanajuato was not warned by the federal government the pipelines would be closed
nor was the city of queretaro capital of the neighboring state of the same name mayor luis bernardo nava told reuters
