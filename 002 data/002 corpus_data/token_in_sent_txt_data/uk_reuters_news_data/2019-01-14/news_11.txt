venezuela goes to wto to contest colombia fuel import rules
geneva reuters venezuela has launched a complaint at the world trade organization to challenge colombia s restrictions on the distribution of liquid fuels imported from venezuela a filing published by the wto showed on monday
venezuela said colombia was illegally discriminating against its fuel exports by imposing a series of distribution and licensing measures and product surcharges market access measures and pricing policies on venezuelan fuel
colombia has days to settle the dispute or venezuela could ask the wto to adjudicate although the ability of the body to keep refereeing such disputes is in doubt due to a block on judicial appointments
