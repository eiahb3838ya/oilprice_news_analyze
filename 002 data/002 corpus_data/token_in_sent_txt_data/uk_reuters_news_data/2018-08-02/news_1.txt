column-commentary: freezing u.s. fuel standards is a gift to china's auto industry
kate gordon is a fellow at the columbia center on global energy policy senior advisor to the paulson institute and the author of risky business the economic risks of climate change in the united the opinions expressed here are her own by kate gordon aug reuters the trump administration on thursday took a giant step backward on transportation innovation by issuing a proposal to freeze federal rules requiring automakers to design more efficient cars
in april protection agency chief scott pruitt called the current standards too high and said they did not comport with but globally these standards have helped american automakers to remain competitive as other countries particularly china embrace the transition to a economy
by reversing course on regulations the united states is encouraging automakers to build outdated vehicles in a market ceding market leadership to china in the process
current federal vehicle standards require automakers to produce passenger vehicles that meet specific and standards
the administration s proposal lays out eight possible scenarios for scaling back the standards with the preferred option being to freeze them at levels through
whether from a market safety or environmental perspective this is misguided
historically federal regulation of the auto industry has led to better vehicles just look at seat belts safety brakes and glass standards for windshields all of which led to the development of safer cars that have become the global standard over the past half century
looking forward it s clear that or vehicles will dominate our global transportation future
the vehicle emission rules provide incentives for automakers to produce and sell vehicles and electric vehicles in particular as these are both cleaner and more efficient than cars and trucks
companies can manufacture these vehicles but can also meet the standards by purchasing credits from other auto companies that have more mature ev or vehicle lines
the rules are flexible but they re also critical to maintaining leadership on ev manufacturing
according to the environmental and energy study institute eesi policy support is playing a major role in developing and deploying evs in both the united states and china which is why the two countries lead the world in ev registrations today
rolling back federal rules will relieve pressure for manufacturers to invest in electric vehicles and could have significant impacts for the united states
last year global ev sales surpassed the one million mark for the first time
battery pack prices dropped percent from through a trend that will only accelerate as global demand for evs rises
china recently joined the uk france norway and india in pledging to phase out the use of vehicles in the coming decades
even exxon bp and opec project surging demand for electric vehicles out to and the most aggressive market outlook shows evs making up over percent of the entire global vehicle fleet by
automakers are reading the tea leaves
globally they ve announced billion in investments to get million more electric vehicles on the world s roads by around
the united states is making a strong showing on evs but china leads the pack
in half of global ev production took place in china where demand for electric vehicles is expected to triple by
the government is offering generous incentives to scale up ev production and sales
more important china has offered generous terms to international automakers looking to establish themselves in the country
it s working american companies like ford and general motors have announced hefty investments in china s ev market and ford s chairman is on the record as saying that china will lead the world in ev the united states accounted for percent of global production of electric vehicles in putting it in second place behind china
while domestic policies are spurring significant growth in the ev market there is also increasing consumer demand
recent data from aaa shows that one in five drivers will likely go electric when buying their next car and drivers are becoming less concerned about running out of battery charge while driving evs
ford gm and toyota are all adapting their production accordingly indicative of the larger global shift toward evs
but of the top electric vehicle manufacturers nine have headquarters in china while only three are based in the united states
china accounts for percent of global investment in evs and projections show that the country will lead the market through
china s potential dominance in the changing auto sector matters
auto manufacturing constitutes about three percent of gdp and accounts for the most jobs of any manufacturing sector
losing these jobs and this market share to another country is no laughing matter especially in the midwest and southeast states in michigan ohio and tennessee auto industry jobs make up percent or more of the entire state labor force
freezing fuel efficiency standards at this critical juncture when momentum is picking up and billions of dollars in investments are following suit would cede the growing ev market to china and create unnecessary regulatory uncertainty for automakers in the united states
the trump administration should preserve the current standards or risk encouraging american automakers to build the cars of the past in an increasingly electric future
