graphic-phew! asia, europe heatwave pushes australia coal prices to 6-year high
asia and europe hit by extreme heatwave demand for power to run cooling systems spikes eu nuclear output falls reactors have to dial back in heat coal prices outperform oil and gas in by henning gloystein singapore aug reuters australian thermal coal prices have hit fresh highs as a heatwave across the northern hemisphere has triggered a spike in demand for power to help keep air conditioners cranking out cool blasts
spot thermal coal cargo prices from australia s newcastle terminal last settled at per tonne their highest since february and up by a third from their low set in april
extreme heat in asia and europe is pushing power demand for industrial and also residential cooling above what s normal for this time of the year said one utility trader declining to be named as he was not authorised to talk about commercial matters
coal has reacted stronger than natural gas because more spare coal capacity has been activated he said
temperatures in key regions of north asia and europe hit records in july and the heat that has continued into august is set to persist meteorological services said
weather analyst ed whalen said widespread warmth between degrees celsius above normal was observed across much of south central east and northeast china over the past seven days
hot weather would this week dominate most of china once again he added
in japan the unusual heatwave last week pushed temperatures in tokyo above degrees celsius
beyond maximising japanese utilities have cranked up old power stations to cope with the spike in power demand which has also sent the country s wholesale electricity prices to record highs
extreme heat has also gripped large parts of europe with temperatures in spain and portugal exceeding degrees celsius and even scandinavia seeing temperatures of more than degrees
the hot weather has also pushed up river temperatures across the region forcing several nuclear power stations that use the waters for reactor cooling to reduce output
european utilities especially in germany have turned to power stations to fill some of that gap generation data in thomson reuters eikon showed
germany and europe are not major buyers of australian coal but their increased demand is still being felt as a ripple effect amid a globally tighter coal market traders said
overall thermal coal prices have this year have outperformed other fossil fuels like crude oil and liquefied natural gas as the strong demand comes amid stagnant output while availablility in oil and gas has been rising
