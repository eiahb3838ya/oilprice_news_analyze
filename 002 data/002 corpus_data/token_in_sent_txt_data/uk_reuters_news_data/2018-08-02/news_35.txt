analysis-u.s. utilities balk at expanded carbon-capture subsidy
richmond texas reuters few energy policies can bring together coal miners oil drillers environmentalists republicans and democrats
but tax credits for capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions have appeased all these camps and congress this year tripled the subsidy s value with broad bipartisan support
if only they could convince utilities the biggest industrial polluters to get on board
a reuters survey of the top power companies showed eight have no plans to purchase and install carbon capture and storage ccs equipment citing high costs and uncertain demand while the other two declined to comment
another three utilities that are to adopt the technology because of their proximity to existing carbon pipelines and coal reserves also said they have no plans to tap the newly enriched subsidy
the technology employs sophisticated equipment to pull carbon dioxide from industrial plants and then inject it underground so it never pollutes the atmosphere
that could help fight climate change while giving coal and natural gas plants a new commodity they can sell to oil drillers
when carbon dioxide is injected into ageing oil fields it helps drillers increase pressure and push more oil to the surface
the potential of ccs is on display in texas where the utility nrg and joint venture partner jx nippon a japanese energy firm built a billion operation called petra nova at the state s largest power plant
in the months since nrg installed the shiny steel pipes and towers the project has kept nearly million tons of gas from the atmosphere and multiplied oil output at the nearby west ranch oil field by
petra nova had key financial advantages that are difficult for other utilities to duplicate
the japanese government provided a million million loan to the project in hopes of finding better ways to use coal as an alternative to nuclear energy after the fukushima nuclear disaster in
the effort also won a million grant in from the department of energy s clean coal power initiative which supports innovations that produce clean reliable and affordable electricity from coal
david knox an nrg spokesman said operating petra nova is showing the firm ways to cut costs for the next generation of the technology such as using smaller towers with less steel
we feel you can build a second one for maybe up to percent cheaper knox said although his company is focussed on perfecting petra nova rather than building a new ccs operation
other utilities that do not have access to the same government and private funding worry that investments on ccs would not pay off even with tax credits now worth per tonne of carbon dioxide captured and reused compared to previously
any new industrial facility that injects carbon dioxide into an oil field before is eligible for the expanded tax credit but the programme s success relies heavily on power plants which produce nearly percent of carbon emissions
although increased credits for ccs are positive the amount still does not address the significant capital and operating costs said melissa mchenry a spokeswoman for american electric power in a comment typical of responses from other utilities
duke energy southern dominion exelon xcel pg e and edison international also said they had no such plans while nextera energy inc and pseg did not comment
three small utilities that industry watchers say are among the to adopt ccs technology rocky mountain power black hills and og e also told reuters they had no plans to do so
carbon capture is definitely interesting it just hasn t made economic sense just yet said spencer hall a spokesman for rocky mountain power
utilities say that it is unclear when or if revenues from ccs would cover the required investment
another concern is that president donald trump s successor could reverse efforts to support the coal industry accelerating plant closures and making ccs investments pointless
the hesitancy of utilities represents a setback for the coal industry which had hoped carbon capture would help extend the lives of power plants
it also means that oil companies that want access to greater supplies of carbon dioxide may need to look beyond coal and gas plants
texas drillers have been revitalising ageing fields for years using carbon dioxide from naturally occurring deposits and from natural gas processing
but those supplies are not enough to sustain the industry s ambitions
occidental petroleum corp the top user of the technique in the permian basin wants to expand its use of carbon injection from traditional oil fields to shale wells said jody elliott the president of occidental s american operations
the company believes the technique could boost oil output in the largest oil field by barrels per day from million now
the permian has a large inventory of future projects which could be developed over the next years elliott said
but that would require carbon captured from power stations and plants that make ethanol fertiliser and cement along with billions of dollars in new pipelines to take carbon to the fields
julio friedmann who worked in the energy department under president barack obama and earlier as a scientist for exxon mobil said he sees interest from ethanol plants and other industrial facilities to add carbon capture to plants but urged utilities to join them
i don t know what they imagine they are looking for he said
but if they are just waiting for better policy treatment they may be reporting by timothy gardner editing by richard valdmanis and brian thevenot
