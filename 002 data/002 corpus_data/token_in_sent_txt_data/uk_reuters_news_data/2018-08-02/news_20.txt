brazil sugar output seen even smaller next year as crop shrinks
araçatuba brazil aug reuters brazil s is likely to produce an even smaller amount of sugar next year after a sharp drop reported in the current crop as a harsh drought and reduced crop care will lead to a poor cane harvest according to industry representatives
the world s largest sugar producing region is expected by most analysts to cut output in the current crop which runs from april to march to around million tonnes from million tonnes in the previous crop as cane volumes fall and mills prioritize ethanol production at the expense of sugar due to better returns for the biofuel
it is hard to believe but we see an even smaller cane crop next year said dib nunes jr a director at consulting firm cana
analysts project the ongoing cane crop to fall to million tonnes from million tonnes last year as most fields have not had widespread rains for more than two months
if next year s crop shrinks it would be the fourth consecutive reduction since the record million tonnes of cane in
with less cane and the focus on ethanol sugar output would decrease again
most mills are short of money they are cutting investment in plants and cane fields to pay bills nunes said
he expects around percent of fields to be renovated this year lower than an ideal level of to percent which will lead to older cane fields that tend to produce less
marcos tulio bullio a cane industry consultant at mtb consultoria empresarial agrees that crop care is going to be weak this year
they will be happy if they at least manage to apply herbicides forget about other things he said
weed killers are key for cane plantations to avoid weeds that steal nutrients from cane
the consultants talked to reuters on the sidelines of the national bioenergy congress a event organized by industry group udop in araçatuba sao paulo state
even with poor crop care there is a possibility for a larger cane crop next season if it rains a lot in the brazilian summer from december to march sugar and ethanol broker and analyst tarcilo rodrigues said
celso jungueira franco owner of the santa adélia mill disagrees
we haven t seen a drop in the araçatuba region for almost days
mills aborted planting plans due to poor soil moisture
even if it rains a lot that will not compensate he said
