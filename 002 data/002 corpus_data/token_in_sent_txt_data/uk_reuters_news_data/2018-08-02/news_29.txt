column-white house escalates china trade dispute to secure early breakthrough: kemp
john kemp is a reuters market analyst
the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london aug reuters the united states has adopted an escalate to negotiate strategy towards china threatening a dramatic hike in tariffs to try to force a resumption of trade talks while the economy remains strong and as elections approach in november
president donald trump has reportedly rejected a plan to levy tariffs of percent on an additional billion of imports from china and ordered aides to prepare a proposal for tariffs at the higher rate of percent
the levies are in addition to the tariffs on billion of imports that have already gone into effect and the billion of tariffs announced but not yet implemented
the administration s approach to china is the same one it has employed in dealing with north korea iran the european union and nafta partners
the basic strategy including the risks and opportunities will be familiar to anyone who has studied the cold war confrontation with the soviet union on escalation metaphors and scenarios kahn
the administration s decision to escalate the confrontation dramatically at this point threatening significant tariffs on a wide range of imports including consumer items is likely to stem from a combination of strength and fear
so far the trade war appears to have hit china s economy and financial markets harder than the united states which has given the administration confidence that it is escalating from a position of strength
the s equity index is up by more than percent since the start of and percent since the start of while china s shanghai composite index has fallen by percent and percent respectively
the dollar has strengthened by percent against china s yuan since the beginning of the year and has risen by around percent on a basis against the currencies of other major trading partners
china s economy has shown signs of slowing with the central government resorting to fiscal and monetary stimulus to offset the slowdown in external demand and boost confidence
in contrast the economy expanded at an annualised rate of percent in the second quarter the fastest for almost four years according to advance estimates
manufacturers have reported a upturn in business activity in recent months while consumer confidence is close to highs
the asymmetric economic and financial performance of the united states and china has convinced the white house it has escalation dominance and should press home its advantage
the white house strategy has been to escalate secure in the belief china has more to lose than the united states on each of the next few rungs up the escalation ladder
until now china has matched tariff moves but not sought to escalate them which has also probably also emboldened the white house to think it holds a stronger position on the escalation ladder
but if the white house thinks it is escalating from a position of strength it probably also fears strength may not last forever and could diminish the longer the conflict lasts
rapid gdp growth in the second quarter was mostly the result of tax cuts which stimulated consumer spending as well as a race to export soybeans and beat the tariffs
growth in the third and fourth quarters is likely to be slower as these temporary effects unwind and the baseline for comparisons becomes more challenging
economic expansions tend to be cyclical and even within each expansion there are spurts of rapid growth followed by more sluggish intervals so the administration can not count on the recent spurt to be sustained
businesses are already starting to report widespread increases in input costs in part as a result of steel and aluminium tariffs
consumer price inflation is also rising and starting to erode the real value of wage rises
so far the administration has tried to avoid imposing tariffs on consumer items in order to avoid politically controversial price rises at retail level
but if the united states is forced to carry out its threat and actually imposes percent tariffs on billion worth of additional items from china hitting consumer goods will become inevitable
until now senior administration officials have made great efforts to reassure investors and businesses that a tariffs are unlikely to be imposed b even if imposed the economic impact will be small c the economy is strong enough to weather any hit and d the pain is worth the gains from resetting relations with china
if the white house is forced to carry out its threat to extend percent tariffs to a much wider range of items however the fallout will be greater and pose a more serious test of resolve for investors and businesses
part of the strategy seems to be to intensify the pressure on china quickly through rapid escalation in the hope it will force an early restart of negotiations on advantageous terms and permit quickly before the economic damage becomes too great
if the white house can secure an early resumption of negotiations or an early settlement even a partial one it will feature heavily in the political campaign ahead of congressional elections as a successful example of the president s tough negotiating style
the administration therefore has a strong incentive to escalate quickly in the hope of forcing a favourable outcome well before the country goes to the polls in november
for the white house the economic and political cycles favour rapid escalation in the hope of being able to claim an equally quick victory before the costs start to rise
by bringing the conflict to a crisis in the greek sense of a moment of decision the administration hopes to end the dispute or at least before the damage grows
china s reaction remains uncertain however which introduces a dangerous element into the escalation strategy and means it could backfire
china s economy is under greater pressure in the short term but its policymakers may conclude that it is better to absorb the costs and wait for the pressure to start to mount on the united states
in the end tariffs are a tax on consumers and if high tariffs go into effect on consumer items and are sustained for any length of time the economic and political fallout could be considerable
there are already some preliminary signs that the global economic expansion has started to slow under pressure from higher oil prices and the costs and uncertainty created by the trade conflict
if the united states chooses to escalate rapidly while china elects to ride out the attack and wait for the costs to rebound on the and global economies the damage to both as well as third countries could be extensive
