bangladesh sees stalled floating lng terminal starting operations in days
dhaka aug reuters a vessel that arrived in bangladesh in april to offload its maiden cargo of liquefied natural gas and moor permanently as an import terminal should begin operations within a week after bad weather hampered its an official said on thursday
the floating storage and regasification unit fsru will allow bangladesh to import lng for the first time as its domestic gas production falls and will boost several power projects in a nation where percent go without electricity
since its arrival at moheshkhali near cox s bazar in southeast bangladesh bad weather has hampered the fsru s efforts to dock properly connect to the import infrastructure and offload its first cargo of qatari lng officials have said
the delay was basically the rough sea
it the project will succeed very soon hopefully within a week a director at energy firm petrobangla s lng division said
the excellence fsru is operated by privately owned company excelerate which launched the first fsru in the world in and still dominates the industry alongside golar lng hoegh and bw group s lng arm
two senior petrobangla officials said the firm would contest excelerate s declaration of force majeure on the project due to the delays
declaring force majeure absolves a company from responsibility for delays to fulfilling contracts due to circumstances beyond its control
they have claimed force majeure for bad weather but we haven t accepted it one of the officials said
petrobangla doesn t have any obligation to pay any money before the gas flow starts
excelerate will pay demurrage as per that official said technical experts from international finance corp an arm of the world bank which lent to the million project were on site monitoring progress
the country of million people relies on its gas resources for percent of its energy production but as demand has risen its falling supply has struggled to keep up prompting it to consider a host of lng projects
aside from the moheshkhali project several others are being considered usually combining lng imports with onshore power plants that would use the regasified fuel as feedstock or with fertiliser complexes that are heavily
most recently two projects costing a combined billion were announced involving firm general electric
energy trading houses gunvor vitol and trafigura have also chased projects in bangladesh is seen as an ideal lng importer because it has the legacy of using gas and therefore much of the onshore infrastructure already unlike some other countries that have struggled to get lng projects off the ground
nasrul hamid state minister for power energy and mineral resources said the moheshkhali project would help bangladesh import million cubic metres of gas a day by
we have a robust internal gas supply system which has historically transmitted our local gas
this grid will carry the lng internally
this is an advantage for us he said
