tepic mexico aug thomson reuters foundation mexico s andres manuel lopez obrador will have a better chance of slashing poverty and inequality if he weaves a strong green thread through his policies analysts say
but despite high hopes the environment will be a top priority for his government some fear plans to boost energy security by revitalising mexico s petroleum industry sit uncomfortably with pledges on climate change and biodiversity
if they achieve everything they say in six years mexico will be in a very strong position regarding environmental protection gustavo ampugnani mexico director for conservation group greenpeace told the thomson reuters foundation
it s the chance to see environment and climate themes intersecting with other policies not divided off as happened in the previous lopez obrador a former mayor of mexico city known by his initials amlo swept to victory on july vowing to tackle corruption violence and inequality in a bid to transform the latin american country where over percent live in poverty
outlining its environmental strategy before the poll his party said it would prioritise communities as it seeks to improve water quality and access while strengthening climate change action and promoting sustainable cities and biodiversity
however experts say steps to slash carbon emissions reduce deadly air pollution and push greener public transport are at odds with the new president s intention to reinvigorate the petroleum industry
seeking to curb massive fossil fuel imports from the united states lopez obrador wants to prioritise domestic crude oil production which has fallen since while building one or two refineries during his term which begins on
andres flores montalvo climate change director for the world resources institute mexico a think tank said mexico had high potential for cleaner energy sources
that can help a lot in achieving the main goal which is energy with many other benefits he said
mexico has a target of producing percent of electricity from clean sources by compared to just over a fifth today
fighting poverty and climate change are closely linked flores added

in mexico where water access is deemed a human right more than percent of homes lack a regular water supply and percent of surface water is contaminated
environmentalists said more money was needed to enforce laws to stop industrial pollution and protect watersheds
restoring damaged ecosystems like forests which are largely owned by rural and indigenous communities could also improve water access and quality while creating local jobs they added
the new government s plan for a national climate change policy that promotes renewable energy sources including solar wind and mini plants could turn on the lights and bring opportunities for poor communities experts said
large investors are increasingly looking to holdings and are less interested in petroleum said alba aguilar priego head of new markets at the mexican stock exchange
they are eyeing assets involving renewable energy clean transport and water and waste management said aguilar whose exchange expects to start carbon trading next year
she urged the new government to make environmental disclosure mandatory for businesses to help investors choose well and ensure pension funds put a minimum into green assets
rolling out mexico s national biodiversity strategy will be essential to strengthen its ecosystems by said the national commission for the knowledge and use of biodiversity conabio which published the plan in
we are running out of time said andrea cruz angon conabio s biodiversity strategies coordinator
aware of the new government s funding constraints conabio is working with other organisations on ways to cover the costs of implementing the strategy which focuses on conservation landscape restoration and sustainable resource management
meanwhile with nearly percent of mexicans living in cities morena wants to make urban areas more sustainable and generate finance to upgrade public transport
also on its list are reducing marine and coastal damage exacerbated by poorly planned development while stopping illegal felling in mexico s forests
the party says percent of wood on the market comes from unauthorised sources
