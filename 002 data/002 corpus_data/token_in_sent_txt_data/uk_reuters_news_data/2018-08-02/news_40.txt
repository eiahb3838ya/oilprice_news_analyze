update 3-shanghai exchange mulls market makers to boost crude futures liquidity
investors brokers flag worries about forward month liquidity september expiry seen as big test for shanghai crude contracts reledes changes sourcing cites ine response in paragraphs and by meng meng and josephine mason beijing aug reuters shanghai international energy exchange ine is considering appointing market makers to boost trading volumes in its nascent crude oil futures amid growing concerns about liquidity as the first contract heads for expiry later this month
responding to a report by reuters earlier on thursday the ine part of the shanghai futures exchange shfe said in an email that it was studying introducing a scheme following requests from some investors
the exchange has approached at least two major brokers in recent weeks about finding investors to help drum up business in the forward months two sources familiar with the matter said
those investors would be similar to market makers who are often deployed by international exchanges such as cme group inc and intercontinental exchange to fuel activity in new contracts
in recent days some market investors have asked the exchange to follow practices from other international exchanges and introduce the market making scheme to further provide liquidity for forward month contracts the ine said
we are seriously considering the request and demands from investors and are currently studying and seeking advice from investors for a plan the exchange said
the potential candidates for the role would be institutional investors such as wealth managers and hedge funds the sources said
the sources declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media
the move comes amid worries among investors and brokers that liquidity in the market is concentrated in the september contract which expires at the end of this month
september s expiry is seen as a big test of china s first oil contract which was launched four months ago aimed at gaining greater clout in global crude pricing
more investors will roll their september contracts into december in the coming weeks
right now liquidity in december is not high enough to attract big investors said wang xiao head of crude oil research with guotai junan futures
oil majors have helped provide liquidity but getting a commitment from other investors to do so would enhance efforts to increase interest in the market
monthly exchange data shows that turnover in the contract has surged since its launch
in july it accounted for percent of global turnover in oil futures taking third place behind london s brent and west texas intermediate wti with arab oil heavyweight dubai in fourth
but most of the daily turnover and open interest a measure of liquidity is concentrated in the september contract which expires at the end of this month
the december contract has a cluster of activity but the is steep
chinese commodity futures investors do not typically trade steadily over the months but instead pick specific months in which they deal
that complicates efforts to trade spreads between brent wti and shanghai
the monthly gap between shanghai contracts and global oil futures created difficulties for arbitrage said wang
having more liquidity spread out across forward months is considered important for luring international hedge funds and other financial players who like to trade month by month
open interest across the first five months of the brent and wti contracts and is relatively evenly spread out
ine slashed fees for the october and november contracts last month and on tuesday cut them for the january and february months which was seen as an effort to make liquidity spread out more evenly across forward months and to engage in industrial traders such as refiners who tend to trade month by month the ine said
combined open interest in those four contracts was just lots on thursday equivalent to just under barrels of oil and tiny in comparison to september which has almost lots of open interest
