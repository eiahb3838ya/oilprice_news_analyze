update 6-u.s. states vow to fight trump rollback on auto emissions
reuters california and other states promised on thursday to fight a trump administration proposal to weaken fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks and force states into line arguing the united states has an obligation to protect the environment for future generations
the administration billed the proposed rollback from fuel efficiency standards as a way to help car companies and lower vehicle prices for consumers but critics said the plan would accelerate climate change and increase fuel prices
by seeking to strip california of its authority to set its own strict vehicle emissions standards the proposal also opens new questions about the limits of federal powers over states
the states and washington announced they would sue to halt the proposed rollback touching off what will likely be a heated legal showdown possibly making it to the supreme court
it could also become a polarizing issue in elections in november
the trump administration has launched a brazen attack no matter how it is cloaked on our nation s clean car standards said california s attorney general xavier becerra
california will use every legal tool at its disposal to defend strict standards he said in a statement
many states have adopted california s emission rules and together they make up about one third of the auto market making the stakes for the autos industry enormous
the administration said the proposed rollback would mean billions of dollars in regulatory savings for car manufacturers
but the industry is pushing for a negotiated settlement between states and the administration to lift uncertainty over the kinds of cars and trucks it will need to produce for the american market in the coming years
the proposal to roll back efforts is in line with president donald trump s decision last year to abandon the paris agreement under which countries agreed to take steps to mitigate global warming
it also dovetails with the republican president s broader effort to unwind green regulation much of it enacted by democratic former president barack obama s administration
the proposal from the transportation department and environmental protection agency would freeze fuel efficiency standards at levels through and require dramatically fewer electric vehicles as more people continue to drive vehicles
the administration said the freeze would boost oil consumption by about barrels of oil a day by the and argued it would prevent up to traffic fatalities per year by reducing the price of new vehicles and so prompting people to buy newer safer vehicles more quickly
unless the obama administration s punishing standards are changed consumer choice will be limited and the cost of vehicles will skyrocket said republican senator john barrasso
americans shouldn t be denied the ability to purchase a car or truck that meets their environmental groups criticized the assertion about reducing crash deaths and said the proposal would drive up gasoline prices increase smog and reverse one of the most significant steps washington has taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions
the clean car standards are already saving our families billions at the pump supporting nearly american jobs and cleaning up dangerous tailpipe pollution said rhea suh president of the natural resources defense council
we need to speed up that progress not slide the administration must gather feedback on the proposal before it is finalized a process that could take months and that could be further delayed by lawsuits
the transportation department says the proposal would shrink regulatory costs for automakers by billion through reducing by more than billion what general motors co ford motor co and fiat chrysler automobiles nv each would have been expected to spend to comply with the rules
toyota motor corp would save billion and volkswagen ag billion
general motors said in a statement that it wants to work with all parties to achieve one national program adding it was committed to continually improving fuel economy and our commitment to an the administration also contends that hiking oil consumption by to percent over forecast levels would have a minimal impact on the environment boosting global average temperature by just of a degree celsius by trump s decision to challenge california s authority to regulate vehicle emissions upends decades of federal policy that allowed the most populous and richest state to combat air pollution that particularly afflicts los angeles
the trump administration proposal said california s zero emission vehicle rules adopted by nine other states are technologically california will fight this stupidity in every conceivable way possible governor edmund jerry brown a democrat said in a statement
democrats hope to make any rollback of the emissions rules a key part of november s midterm elections when they will try to regain control of one or both chambers of congress
republicans in states with links to the auto industry may counter that the administration is working to ensure automakers can make more profitable larger vehicles including pickups and suvs
some middle ground might be possible
acting epa chief andrew wheeler said on wednesday he would welcome a deal between the industry and states
bill wehrum an assistant epa administrator told reporters on thursday that many things had changed including a drop in fuel prices since the efficiency rules were last set six years ago
he said gas prices are at historically low levels and that changes driving habits that changes the kind of cars and trucks that people want to federal and california officials would soon meet about the proposal wehrum said adding all of us want one national program
we are going to try to work it becerra said california is ready and willing to talk with trump administration regulators but that previous talks have not been fruitful
