rpt-column-distillates hold key to oil prices and global growth: kemp

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london aug reuters middle distillates including road diesel and marine gasoil are the critical link between global growth and the oil market
distillates will be at the heart of three developments in the next two years that determine the direction of oil prices as well as the longevity of the current economic expansion if sustained global economic expansion and the associated growth in trade volumes will boost consumption of significantly and lead to a further drawdown in available stocks
pollution regulations scheduled to go into effect from january will further boost distillate consumption as a cleaner substitute for residual fuel oil in ocean shipping
tightening distillate supplies will push up crude oil prices resulting in a widespread increase in inflation upward pressure on business costs and tending to curb the cyclical expansion
it seems unlikely the global economy will still be growing strongly while oil prices remain at comfortable levels for consumers at the same time as the shipping regulations go into effect at the start of
cyclical tightening of distillate markets plus new fuel regulations are inconsistent with moderate crude oil prices
something will have to give
either global economic growth will slow of its own accord easing the pressure on distillate supplies or crude oil prices will rise enough to force an economic slowdown
accounted for million barrels per day of global oil consumption in around of the total according to bp statistical review of world energy
freight transportation including cargo moved by road rail pipelines barges shipping and aviation is the biggest of fuels derived from the middle part of the crude barrel
substantial quantities are also used by manufacturing firms as well as miners and within the oil and gas industry itself with much smaller volumes used for heating and cooking
distillate consumption is more closely geared to the level of business activity and the macroeconomic cycle than any other section of the oil market
distillate stocks are in turn closely correlated with changes in benchmark crude prices and the shape of the futures curve
since are one of the most important refinery outputs the link is not surprising
as the distillate market alternates between and brent cycles between contango and backwardation
periods when distillate stocks were abnormally high and all linked to slower growth in economic activity have been associated with a large contango in brent
likewise periods when distillate stocks became unusually tight and mostly linked with stronger economic growth have all been associated with brent backwardations
stock draws in distillates have been much more closely associated with the shift in brent spreads than changes in gasoline stocks
the same pattern has been evident during the most recent oil market slump and recovery with distillate stocks surging in and before drawing equally strongly in and so far in
strong growth in distillate consumption in and early coincided with a period of strong and synchronised growth in the major global economies and a marked acceleration in freight movements
distillate consumption is outstripping production in the united states and in much of the rest of the world resulting in a broad reduction in inventories
distillate stocks which were million barrels above the average in early have now fallen to million barrels below in july
distillate consumption rose percent in the first half of but production was up by only percent
distillate inventories are low for this time of year eia july
the same phenomenon is evident globally
oecd distillate stocks have fallen from million barrels in may and million in may to just million in may oil market report iea july
the drawdown in distillate stocks has corresponded closely with the shift in brent calendar spreads from contango to backwardation and the rise in brent spot prices
distillate markets are tightly coupled with the global economy and the relationship likely runs in both directions
changes in the level of manufacturing activity and freight movements have a direct impact on the consumption and availability of transport fuels
but changes in fuel prices also have a significant impact on input costs for a wide range of businesses as well as inflation
the outlook for distillate prices and by extension oil prices therefore depends critically on what happens to the global economy over the next months
if the global economic expansion continues at its current rapid pace distillate availability will become stretched and oil prices will rise strongly
the scheduled implementation of new international maritime organization fuel regulations at the start of will only exacerbate this tightness and could intensify upward pressure on oil prices even before they go into effect
eventually the rise in fuel costs will act as a drag on global economic growth and bring the cyclical expansion to an end
conversely if the global expansion slackens on its own perhaps as a result of trade tensions distillate supplies will be more comfortable
plentiful distillates would curb or even reverse the upward trend in oil prices and extend the current cyclical upswing for an additional period
