white house to propose weaker auto emissions rules, overriding california
aug reuters the trump administration on thursday will move to revoke california s authority to set its own strict tailpipe emissions rules and mandate the sale of electric vehicles as it proposes weakening federal fuel efficiency standards
the proposal to roll back efforts to be released early on thursday according to one administration official is in line with president donald trump s decision last year to abandon the paris deal aimed at slowing climate change
it will escalate the administration s legal battle with california and about a dozen other states that have adopted california s emission rules and account for about a third of the auto market
seventeen states including california and the district of columbia filed a lawsuit in may challenging the environmental protection agency s decision a month earlier to declare vehicle emission rules in place through not in march california attorney general xavier becerra said he would use every legal tool to protect the current standards
trump promised midwestern auto workers last year that he would tear up vehicle rules touted by the administration of former president barack obama as among its biggest climate actions
democrats hope to make any rollback a key part of the congressional elections
republicans in states with links to the auto industry may contend the administration is working to ensure automakers can make more profitable larger vehicles including pickups and suvs without excess regulation and state interference
some middle ground on the issue might be possible with acting epa chief andrew wheeler saying wednesday he would welcome a deal between the industry and states like california on vehicle fuel economy once they consider the trump administration s proposal
the rollback in emissions standards is problematic for automakers
the administration has said it will deliver regulatory relief potentially worth billions by reducing the need for costly technologies required to achieve greater fuel efficiency
but it does so in a way that could create more uncertainty for an industry already struggling with rising tariff risks and a murky sales outlook
automakers have long pressed for one set of rules for emissions and greenhouse gases saying a national regulatory framework to improve fuel economy reduces complexity and costs for the industry
the preferred option in the administration s proposal to be issued by the epa and the department of transportation would freeze the obama fuel efficiency targets at levels requiring no further improvement
that means the fleets of cars and light trucks sold by automakers in the united states could average about miles km per gallon instead of the mpg projected for under the obama rules
fuel consumption would increase by about barrels daily as a result a person briefed on the matter said adding that such an increase would have only a negligible impact on the global climate
the administration has characterized its proposal to freeze fuel efficiency and emissions targets as a step that would save up to lives per year by reducing the cost of new vehicles and encouraging people to buy safer new cars sooner
environmental groups have criticized that analysis and said the proposal would drive up gasoline prices and reverse one of the most significant steps washington has taken to curb climate changing greenhouse gas emissions
it would also put more lives at risk due to emissions environmental advocates say
trump s decision to challenge california s authority to regulate vehicle emissions upends decades of federal policy undertaken to allow the largest state to combat air pollution that particularly afflicts los angeles
eliminating california s electric vehicle mandate could hurt automakers like tesla inc and general motors co which are already investing billions in evs
relying on the state s regulatory authority california governor jerry brown a democrat set a target in january of putting million vehicles on the roads in california by up from a prior goal of million by
