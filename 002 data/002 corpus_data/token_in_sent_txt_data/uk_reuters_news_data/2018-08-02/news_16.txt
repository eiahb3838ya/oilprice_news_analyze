rising heat will chill poor countries' economies, costing billions
london aug thomson reuters foundation rising temperatures in a warming world will cost poor countries tens of billions of dollars annually as they are less able to keep their workers cool analysts said on thursday
over the next years manual labourers in the agriculture mining oil and gas and manufacturing sectors which are the most prevalent in emerging economies will be hardest hit by higher temperatures said risk consultancy verisk maplecroft
by examining energy infrastructure with temperature data and projected urban population growth researchers said workers in africa and asia would be most affected by rising heat
that means workers are missing days because they suffer from heat stress or their physical capacity to undertake physical activity is diminished because of those high temperatures said richard hewston head of the environment and climate change programme at verisk maplecroft
with lower labour capacity productivity dips off and subsequently you have ripple effects through the sectors with the highest amount of manual labour he told the thomson reuters foundation
this drop in productivity equates to an annual loss of billion a year in south east asia and nearly billion in west africa the consultancy s report said
rapid urbanisation in these emerging economies will also strain energy needs and the demand for cooling such as will soar as temperatures rise resulting in frequent power outages it said
about billion people in asia africa and latin america are at risk from a lack of air conditioning and refrigeration to keep them cool and to preserve food and medicines as temperatures rise says global group sustainable energy for all
even modest amounts of climate change will be impactful so that forces us to do something about it sam fankhauser director of the grantham research institute at the london school of economics said of the verisk maplecroft study
we need to start thinking about how we build our buildings shading airflows green roofs how we might adjust our behaviour and how we design our cities said fankhauser who was not involved in the report
of the world s population will live in cities by with that boom concentrated in three countries india china and nigeria according to united nations estimates released in may
the world health organization has said heat stress linked to climate change is likely to cause extra deaths a year worldwide between and
