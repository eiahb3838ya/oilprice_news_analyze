commodities giant adm ramps up ethanol sales in chicago, irking rivals
new sept reuters archer daniels midland co has sold unusually high volumes of ethanol into the chicago market since late last year as export markets dried up driving down prices in the midwest and angering the company s rivals according to traders and regulatory data
the global commodities powerhouse a major ethanol producer accounted for roughly percent of the million barrels sold at the chicago hub between november and august according to the data reviewed by reuters
previously adm had been a regular buyer in september and october of last year for example adm bought barrels percent of the million total trades in the chicago hub during that stretch according to the data
adm s shift came amid an upheaval in the domestic ethanol market as demand flatlined and export markets including china and brazil were cut off due in part to the effects of president donald trump s widening trade disputes
with growth in export markets slowing ethanol inventories swelled to a record
ethanol traders say adm is saturating the domestic market anchoring prices and bleeding out smaller producers less equipped to manage through the tough times
adm spokeswoman jackie anderson when asked about the shift in the company s strategy said adm does not comment on the specifics of its commercial activity
ethanol futures prices traded on the chicago board of trade late last month fell to per gallon lowest in over a decade
ethanol in chicago cash markets meanwhile were about per gallon just above a low of from december traders told reuters
the heavy selling by adm has led traders who have lost money on the slumping ethanol market to complain to s p global platts which provides benchmark pricing for the physical ethanol contract at different delivery points including chicago
in july platts hosted an ethanol pricing methodology workshop in houston at which senior traders from the largest ethanol trading shops expressed anger about adm s influence on the market according to several traders who attended
it s one person s view of the market said one trader who attended the meeting
traders are angry and they blame adm another trader said
platts said the company is conducting ongoing discussions about evolving its pricing methodology including feedback from the july conference
we are still evaluating the feedback and continuing bilateral conversations with market participants who were not able to attend the company said in a written statement
adm can produce roughly billion gallons of ethanol annually about percent of capacity
despite its massive production it has often been a buyer on the cash market to supplement its supply deals or to support a market view dealers said
the company has told investors that a sustained trade war with china could hurt sales
china considered the top growth market for ethanol exports imposed tariffs of about percent on imports of american biofuel all but halting shipments there
the commodity giant has also been using the futures market to show that it could deliver additional volumes in and around the chicago hub
the company can easily ship to chicago from its large ethanol plants in iowa
on the chicago board of trade adm registered all ethanol contracts for delivery as of tuesday each contract representing gallons or enough for about one rail tanker car the most in the history of the contract according to cme group data
the registrations were a signal to the over other companies also registered to participate in cbot ethanol deliveries which include shell green plains inc vitol and mercuria that adm has an abundant supply of biofuel in storage to tap and sell against the futures contract
we don t really know or understand what they are doing said one ceo of a ethanol company
one trader noted that adm was short barrels last week on the chicago board of trade
as a major ethanol producer they are long physical gallons so having a short position in futures as a hedge against physical price declines is not unusual traders said
