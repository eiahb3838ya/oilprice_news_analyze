maersk to invest in exhaust scrubbers ahead of 2020 fuel quality changes
reuters
the world s biggest container shipping group will add devices to reduce harmful exhaust emissions to some of its ships ahead of new global fuel regulations starting in
to combat air pollution the international maritime organization imo the united nations shipping agency has set global regulations to cap the sulphur content in marine fuels known as bunkers at percent down from percent now
shipowners could meet the new regulations by installing exhaust cleaning systems known as scrubbers and continue to burn cheaper fuel oil hsfo
the companies could also comply by burning costlier fuels such as marine gasoil fuel oil or liquefied natural gas lng
as part of the preparations we have decided to invest in new scrubber technology on a limited number of vessels in our fleet of around container vessels lindegaard head of maersk oil trading told reuters in an email
using scrubber technology is a small part of and just one of several elements in our overall fuel sourcing strategy to ensure compliance in time he said
a spate of recent scrubber installation orders led energy researchers to revise their demand forecasts for bunker fuel higher as the scrubbers will let the ships continue to burn hsfo
but a switch to fuels is still widely seen as the most practical form of compliance given the high investment and operational costs associated with scrubbers and uncertainty around future emissions regulations
while we will continue to explore how to best comply with the sulphur cap we still believe the best solution remains with compliant fuels from refineries on land said lindegaard
in august maersk announced it had reached an agreement with royal vopak an independent tank storage operator to launch a percent sulphur fuel bunkering facility in rotterdam
the joint initiative with vopak will meet about percent of maersk s global demand for imo compliant fuels and we are looking into more bunkering facilities like this said lindegaard
maersk oil trading purchases marine fuel for its parent company
and is among the biggest bunker buyers in the world
