starting most airlines flying international routes will begin monitoring their fuel and carbon emissions as part of a landmark agreement brokered two years ago by icao
according to industry figures air transport accounts for percent of global carbon emissions
budget carrier norwegian air shuttle asa which operates new boeing dreamliners and max aircraft was ranked first of the transatlantic carriers for fuel efficiency while british airways part of the international airlines group came in last
of the carriers delta air lines had the most fuel efficient fleet meeting the industry average while united airlines was ranked third from the bottom
