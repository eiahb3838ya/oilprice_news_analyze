update 1-venezuela's pdvsa to reopen damaged port dock by month's end -documents
adds context details on cargoes by marianna parraga sept reuters pdvsa expects to reopen the south dock of venezuela s main oil port jose by the end of september easing strains on crude exports delayed due to a tanker collision last month according to internal trade documents from the oil firm seen by reuters
last week pdvsa began diverting tankers to puerto la cruz for loading but the south american country s crude exports have remained slow in recent weeks as few customers have accepted the maximum neighboring terminals can handle
besides puerto la cruz tankers waiting to load a total million barrels of venezuelan upgraded and diluted crudes also plan to be serviced this month by two monobuoys at jose including cargoes scheduled for chevron corp and russia s rosneft the documents showed
but a cargo of diluted crude oil dco scheduled to be lifted by rosneft at jose between late september and early october was cancelled according to the documents
rosneft and pdvsa in april agreed to a remediation plan to refinance an agreement after delays to deliver cargoes of venezuelan crude on time
dco shipments scheduled since then belong to that plan
pdvsa did not immediately reply to a request for comment
at least three other cargoes for valero energy and pdvsa s refining unit citgo petroleum plan to be loaded at jose s available docks and monobuoys in the coming days after delays
valero also would pick up two additional cargoes of morichal crude after a maintenance project that would halt the petromonagas crude upgrader in august was again postponed allowing more production
pdvsa and its joint ventures exported million barrels per day bpd of crude last month a percent decline versus july according to thomson reuters trade flows data
the country s oil output fell again in august to million bpd according to numbers reported by opec on wednesday
venezuela s accumulated annual production this year is million bpd the lowest since
