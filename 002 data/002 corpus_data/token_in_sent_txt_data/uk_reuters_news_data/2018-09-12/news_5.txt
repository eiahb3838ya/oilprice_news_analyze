update 2-airlines lag climate goals despite fuel efficiency improvement -study
montreal reuters airline fuel efficiency on transatlantic flights has improved by one percent a year since as carriers modernized their fleets but the industry still lags its own climate goals according to a study released on wednesday by the international council on clean transportation
but the study s findings were challenged later wednesday by an aviation industry group which argued that carriers are actually ahead of their targets
according to the icct study the industry s average fuel efficiency as measured by how much fuel is used to transport passengers improved to passenger kilometers per litre of fuel from between and as carriers opted for modern aircraft with lower fuel burn and operated fuller planes
airlines have been switching to more planes to mitigate the impact of high oil prices on their margins
the aviation industry has also set a goal of capping emissions from international flights at levels despite rising passenger traffic as demand for global travel climbs
haldane dodd spokesman for the air transport action group atag which counts airlines among its members said the industry is achieving a percent rolling average fleet fuel efficiency improvement for all flights
that figure is ahead of a goal of percent efficiency improvements per year dodd said by email
rankings of airline efficiency based on assumptions and modelled estimates are not a useful tool for either the public or policymakers as they present an inaccurate picture of the operation dodd said
the icct compared the fuel efficiency of nonstop passenger flights between north america and europe by major airlines
while the study only examined transatlantic flights the authors argued the results showed industry lagged its goals
flights to and from european states are expected to account for percent of all carbon emissions from global aviation in the icct said citing data from the international civil aviation organization icao
new policies to accelerate investments in more aircraft and operations are critical if industry is to meet its climate goals said dan rutherford aviation program director for the icct a independent research organization
according to the study budget carrier norwegian air shuttle asa was ranked first of transatlantic carriers for fuel efficiency while british airways part of the international airlines group came in last
british airways on wednesday said its fuel efficiency per passenger appears lower because on such routes the carrier has a greater share of the premium market which has fewer seats
