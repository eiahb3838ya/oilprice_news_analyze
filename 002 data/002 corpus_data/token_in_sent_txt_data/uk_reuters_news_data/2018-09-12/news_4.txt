noc says libyan oil output normal despite attack on its headquarters
tripoli reuters libya s state oil firm noc said on wednesday that it continued to manage its operations normally throughout the country without loss of production after a shooting attack on its tripoli headquarters
the attack on monday claimed by islamic state militants killed two people and wounded
noc provides the vast bulk of the libyan state s income and along with the central bank is one of the only state enterprises still functioning well after years of armed factional conflict
the national oil corporation has assured all citizens that it has implemented contingency plans to deal with the crisis to ensure that its production and daily operations continue on a regular basis noc said in a statement
this attack did not cause a loss of production noc chairman mustafa sonallah said in the statement which did not reveal noc s current production level
however it led to the shedding of libyan blood sonallah said adding that the attack is indicative of the weakness and fragility of the security arrangements in the country
he also said the current security vacuum allows terrorist organisations to be present inside the country
libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since causing political deadlock and an economic crisis
however the noc has continued to function relatively normally across libya which relies on oil exports for most of its income
oil output has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day
islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as mobile units in libya s southern desert according to libyan and western officials
