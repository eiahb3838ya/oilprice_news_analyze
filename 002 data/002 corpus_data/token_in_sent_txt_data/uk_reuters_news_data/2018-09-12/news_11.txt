update 3-opec sees slower 2019 oil demand growth, warns on economy
london reuters opec on wednesday further trimmed its forecast for global oil demand growth and said the risk to the economic outlook was skewed to the downside adding a new challenge to the group s efforts to support the market next year
in a monthly report the organization of the petroleum exporting countries said world oil demand next year would rise by million barrels per day bpd bpd less than last month and the second consecutive reduction in the forecast
the report provides further indication the rapid oil demand that helped opec and allies get rid of a supply glut will moderate in
opec last month said global growth faced numerous challenges although its latest report suggests concern about them has deepened
rising challenges in some emerging and developing economies are skewing the current global economic growth risk forecast to the downside opec said in the report
rising trade tensions and the consequences of further potential monetary tightening by central banks in combination with rising global debt levels are additional crude briefly pared gains after the opec report was released but later rallied to trade above a barrel a level reached earlier this year for the first time since supported by expectations for a further drop in iranian exports
opec and a group of countries agreed on june to return to percent compliance with oil output cuts that began in january after months of underproduction by venezuela and others pushed adherence above percent
the economic downside risks will provide a talking point for a group of opec and energy ministers meeting on in algiers to monitor the market
the meeting could make policy recommendations
opec s next meeting to set policy is not until december
in the report opec said its oil output rose in august by bpd to million bpd following the june deal
the biggest rise came from libya which is exempt from the agreement
this helped offset declines in venezuela where production is declining due to the economic crisis and iran as buyers walked away ahead of the sanctions
this means compliance with the original deal has increased to percent according to a reuters calculation meaning members are still cutting more than promised
the original figure for july was percent
the august production rate is lower than the average demand for opec crude in and considerably more than will be needed next year as rivals such as the united states expand supplies
opec said the world will need million bpd from its members in unchanged from last month
this suggests there will be a bpd surplus in the market should opec keep pumping the same amount and other things remain equal
the higher prices that have followed the deal are still prompting more growth in rival supply
opec said it expects production to expand by million bpd next year bpd more than forecast last month
