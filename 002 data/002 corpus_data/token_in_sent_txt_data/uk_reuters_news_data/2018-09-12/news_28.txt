update 2-congo mines minister insists no compromise on new mining code
adds quote by president kabila kolwezi democratic republic of congo sept reuters d emocratic republic of congo s mines minister said on wednesday that a new mining code signed into law in march that hikes royalties and taxes can not be called into question
addressing a mining conference in the copper and city of kolwezi martin kabwelulu called on industry leaders to work to implement the code as it was promulgated by president joseph kabila
major mining companies including glencore and randgold bitterly opposed the code which axes tax exemptions and hikes royalties and profit taxes
they have been holding out hope it might be watered down in further negotiations
it is not the place of any participating party whether civil society mining companies or even the government to try to call into question the text governing the mining sector kabwelulu said
kabila addressed the conference later urging all parties to implement the new code
he also called on mining companies to explore beyond their existing concessions most of which were before being privatised over the past two decades
i call on investors to move beyond the comfort of the land and concessions that were ceded to them by different state companies to take real risks by exploiting the rest of the country he said
companies say the new code s tax hikes and cancelling of exemptions for existing projects against changes to the previous fiscal and customs regimes breach previous agreements with the government and will deter further investment
