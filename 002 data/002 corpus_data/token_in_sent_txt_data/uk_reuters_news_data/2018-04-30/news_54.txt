uk, u.s. study antarctic glacier, hoping to crack sea level risks
oslo reuters britain and the united states launched a million project on monday to study the risks of a collapse of a giant glacier in antarctica that is already shrinking and nudging up global sea levels
the research involving scientists would be the two nations biggest joint scientific project in antarctica since the
ice is thawing from greenland to antarctica and global warming is accelerating the trend
the scientists would study the thwaites glacier which is roughly the size of florida or britain in west antarctica the uk natural environment research council and national science foundation said in a joint statement
rising sea levels are a globally important issue which can not be tackled by one country alone uk science minister sam gyimah said
thwaites and the nearby pine island glacier are two of the biggest and glaciers in antarctica
if both abruptly collapsed allowing ice far inland to flow faster into the oceans world sea levels could rise by more than a meter feet threatening cities from shanghai to san francisco and coastal regions
the scientists would deploy planes hot water drills satellite measurements ships and robot submarines to one of the remotest parts of the planet to see whether the glacier s collapse could begin in the next few decades or centuries the statement said
despite satellites there are still many aspects of the ice and ocean that can not be determined from space said ted scambos of the national snow and ice data center and the lead scientific coordinator
other scientists from south korea germany sweden new zealand and finland would also contribute
the united states is keeping up research even though president donald trump doubts mainstream scientific findings that human activities led by the burning of fossil fuels are the main cause of global warming
