rpt-column-oil's big backwardation spells trouble ahead: kemp
london reuters the oil market is becoming extremely tight as consumption outstrips production and traders expect it to tighten even further over the next six months
the balance between production consumption and inventories is intimately connected with the shape of the oil futures curve
chartbook if consumption is expected to exceed production and inventories are already low and falling spot prices tend to trade at a premium to forward prices
the premium for spot prices over forward prices known as backwardation acts as a signal to conserve remaining stocks as much as possible
the premium for spot prices is intended to boost supply in the short term while encouraging consumers to defer purchases
backwardation is the most important and reliable signal of a tight and tightening oil market
brent futures have recently been trading in a backwardation of more than per barrel over the contract
the current backwardation in brent is among the most extreme in the last quarter of a century and in the percentile of all trading days since
if the backwardation was confined mostly to one or two months it could be dismissed as an aberration or a sign of market manipulation
but big backwardations are evident for all months through and
the increasing backwardation is consistent with statistics from the physical market showing oil inventories are becoming increasingly tight
stocks of crude oil and refined products in the oecd industrialised countries have fallen to just million barrels above the average from a surplus of million barrels at the start of
if oecd stocks are adjusted for the rise in consumption current inventories are now below the average
stocks are expected to decline even further in the second half of the year which traditionally sees higher consumption
global oil consumption is expected to rise by more than million barrels per day in mostly as a result of strong economic growth
production from venezuela is already falling
traders are concerned about further output declines if the united states imposes sanctions on venezuela iran
opec members have indicated they will not increase output before the end of the year which will tighten the market further
the oil market is currently on an unsustainable trajectory with global demand growth systematically outrunning supply
if something can not continue forever it will stop according to stein s law one of the most fundamental constraints in economics popularised by herbert stein the chief economic adviser to president richard nixon
logically there are five ways in which the oil market can be moved off its currently unsustainable course and brought back towards balance slower consumption growth in response to higher prices an economic slowdown or a combination of both opec and its allies lift their output supply disruptions existing and threatened ease shale output increases even faster than expected output increases faster than predicted
the most likely path to rebalancing of the oil market is likely to involve a combination of some or all of these factors
global consumption is sensitive to price changes albeit the response tends to be slow at first before accelerating later and is notoriously slow to appear in the statistics
the relationship between prices and consumption is highly
the higher prices rise and the longer they are expected to stay high the bigger the eventual response from oil consumers
experience suggests by the time demand destruction is evident in the data the oil market will be well on its way to the next slump this was true in and again in
some of the actual and anticipated supply disruptions may ease especially if the rise in oil prices causes the united states to hesitate before imposing tough sanctions on venezuela and iran or to leave loopholes
shale output is likely to accelerate further in the second half of and into the number of rigs drilling for oil is rising again in response to the increase in prices
escalating prices should also filter through into increasing exploration production and development in the sector
finally opec and its allies may decide to start lifting their production via a formal decision or a decrease in compliance before the end of
the oil market is already tight and on track to get tighter
the backwardation is high and could rise even further
but experience suggests such large imbalances between production consumption and inventories are not stable for long
something will have to give soon
supply
demand
or both
