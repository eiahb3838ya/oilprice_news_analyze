poet unseats adm as top global fuel ethanol maker
chicago reuters privately held poet llc has overtaken industry pioneer and global grain merchant archer daniels midland co to become the top ethanol producer in the world the companies told reuters
adm had been the biggest ethanol maker since the united states began requiring refiners to mix billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation s gasoline more than a decade ago under the renewable fuel standard

adm is reducing exposure while poet is expanding in an effort to increase profits through efficiency and scale
poet s annual biofuel capacity has grown to billion gallons and will reach billion by adm s has shrunk to about billion gallons according to figures provided by each company
prior to this year both had capacities of about billion gallons

the company last year had also put some of its plants up for sale but did not find a buyer
meanwhile poet boosted output by adding grain fermenters and other upgrades at several of its ethanol plants and is expanding a facility in marion ohio
poet constantly finds new ways to increase yield make gains in efficiency and maximize returns jeff broin poet chief executive officer told reuters on friday
possible acquisitions by poet of other ethanol plants are also a possibility broin said
