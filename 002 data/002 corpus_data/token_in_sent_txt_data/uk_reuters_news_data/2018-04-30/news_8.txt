exclusive-u.s. epa grants biofuels waiver to billionaire icahn's oil refinery -sources
new york reuters the environmental protection agency has granted a financial hardship waiver to an oil refinery owned by billionaire carl icahn a former adviser to president donald trump exempting the oklahoma facility from requirements under a federal biofuels law according to two industry sources briefed on the matter
the waiver enables icahn s cvr energy inc to avoid tens of millions of dollars in costs related to the renewable fuel standard rfs program
the regulation is meant to cut air pollution reduce petroleum imports and support corn farmers by requiring refiners to mix billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation s gasoline and diesel each year
the small refiners coalition which represents companies that operate small refining facilities said the epa is required by law to help small refineries struggling with these regulations and that such exemptions are crucial to their financial
it applauded epa administrator scott pruitt for protecting small refineries regardless of ownership from the rfs requirements
but the exemption for cvr s wynnewood oklahoma plant prompted criticism from a corn state lawmaker and the powerful corn lobby which has already accused trump s epa of overusing the hardship waiver program in a way that hurts demand for ethanol
hundreds of millions and in some cases billions of dollars in profits isn t my definition of hardship iowa republican senator chuck grassley said in statement condemning the cvr waiver
president trump promised to support biofuels and administrator pruitt is breaking that this one s going to be hard for pruitt to explain brooke coleman head of the advanced biofuels business council industry group said in an email
epa spokeswoman liz bowman said that the agency does not comment on specific refineries
but what i can tell you is that the criteria used to grant waivers has not changed since previous administrations bowman added
cvr spokeswoman brandee stephens declined to comment regarding the waiver
efforts to reach icahn and his attorney for comment were not successful
an early supporter of trump s presidential run and a key supporter on wall street icahn had met with pruitt when pruitt was being vetted in late for the epa administrator job according to news reports at the time
icahn stepped down from his position as special regulatory adviser to the republican president last august after lawmakers cited potential ethical problems in his dual role as an adviser and an investor
icahn is currently under investigation by the justice department for his role in influencing biofuels policy while serving as trump s adviser
some lawmakers have expressed concern that icahn may have used his presidential access to benefit his investments a charge icahn has rejected
the epa has said it has granted more than two dozen waivers for but has declined to name the recipients
under trump s democratic predecessor barack obama the epa granted about eight waivers annually
records show cvr had been denied on at least one occasion
the small refiners coalition said the obama administration had wrongly denied waivers to firms like cvr
reuters has reported that andeavor one of america s biggest refining companies which reported about billion in net profit last year was among the other companies that have received hardship waivers from trump s epa for its small refineries
to prove rfs compliance refiners must earn or purchase tradable blending credits awarded by the government for each blended gallon of fuel and hand them in to the epa yearly
the epa has the authority to exempt small refineries of under barrels per day from the requirement under the hardship waiver program if they can prove that compliance would cause them disproportionate financial with the exemption cvr would not have to turn over the credits related to the wynnewood facility for according to the two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity
the waiver was granted in recent months but the sources did not say precisely when
the trump administration has encouraged small refiners to apply for the hardship waivers
a surge of applications has come to the epa since a court ruling that the agency had used too narrow a definition of financial hardship under obama
the waivers have the potential to save companies tens of millions of dollars by allowing them to avoid blending or paying for credits on the open market and by permitting them to sell any credits they have on hand to others
cvr has reported a million profit in the biofuels credit market in the first quarter of due to what it called a lower rfs obligation an unusual return for a refiner that has no biofuel blending facilities
the company also said it expects its cost of complying with the rfs requirements to fall to million for the entirety of from a previous estimate of million and from roughly million in
