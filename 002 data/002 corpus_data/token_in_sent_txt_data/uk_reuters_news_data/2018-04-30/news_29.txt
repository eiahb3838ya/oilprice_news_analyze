feature-costa rica's new president promises plan to speed clean transport
san jose april thomson reuters foundation costa rica will reach years of independence in and the country s new president plans to mark it with a revolution of his own a plan to end the use of fossil fuels in transport
when we reach years of independent life we will take costa rica forward and celebrate that we ve removed gasoline and diesel from our transportation plans carlos alvarado promised in his victory speech this month
the progressive beat rival fabricio alvarado an evangelical preacher and musician with percent of the vote in elections and will take office on may
the s promise marks the first time a costa rican leader has backed such a move though green organizations have previously urged it
according to alvarado s environmental advisors no date has yet been set for a full phase out of fossil fuels in transport but the plan should be ready by
achieving transport quickly even in a central american country for its environmental commitment will be a significant challenge energy experts say
jose daniel lara a costa rican energy researcher at the university of said completely eliminating fossil fuels within just a few years is probably unrealistic though the plan will lay the groundwork for faster action toward the goal
a proposal like this one must be seen by its rhetoric value and not by its technical precision lara told the thomson reuters foundation
oscar echeverría president of the vehicle and machinery importers association said the transition away from fossil fuels in transport can t be rushed as the clean transport market is so far undeveloped
if there s no previous infrastructure competence affordable prices and waste management we d be leading this process to failure
we need to be careful echeverría said
but economist mónica araya a costa rican sustainability expert and director of costa rica limpia which promotes renewable energy and electric transport said that in a country already rapidly weaning itself off fossil fuels focusing on transport one of the last major challenges could send a powerful message to the world
getting rid of fossil fuels is a big idea coming from a small country
this is an idea that s starting to gain international support with the rise of new technologies she said in an interview
costa rica s push toward clean energy faces no backlash in part because the country has no significant oil or gas industry
but demand for cars is rising as is use of other transport systems and that may prove one of the biggest challenges in meeting the new goal lara said
according to data by the national registry the country s records agency there were twice as many cars registered as babies born in
transport is today the country s main source of climate changing emissions
according to the country s national meteorological institute percent of costa rica s emissions come from energy use and more than two thirds of that is from transport
according to data from the state of the region report put together by a council of costa rica s university leaders public transport has struggled to meet the transport needs of the country
as a result demand for private vehicles has risen dramatically with the car industry growing percent in alone making costa rica one of the fastest growing auto markets in latin america according to the report
one problem in cutting back on fossil fuels is that the country s budget depends on them lara said
according to ministry of treasury data percent more than a fifth of the government s income comes from fossil fuel taxes and most of those are levied on transport
that is particularly problematic because the country has run a budget deficit since with its debt now having climbed to more than percent of gdp last year according to the treasury
the international monetary fund noted in that public debt continues to rise rapidly despite efforts to curb it
but the president s proposal to eliminate fossil fuel use for transport could force a rethink of costa rica s financial dependence on a pollution source lara said
the country could for instance consider broader new taxes on carbon emissions araya said a move that could provide benefits including less spending by the country s health services on respiratory problems
the new a former national employment minister under the country s current government envisions eliminating transport fuels as just another step toward a full of fossil fuels
such an achievement would be a defining moment in the country s history akin to the country s abolition of its army in he said
the effort to end the use of transport fossil fuels is expected to start with reform of the country s hydrocarbon laws
araya said that the rapid international of renewable power and electric transport could make things easier and be a big economic opportunity for costa rica
for example it took almost years to get to one million electric cars worldwide
it took months to reach two million
the third million happened in around the next eight months
this is exponential growth she said
prices are falling and efficiency growing in new clean energy technologies including battery storage she said
the biggest barrier to seeing them much more widely used may simply be that people aren t yet used to them she added
tackling resistance to change is one of the most important tasks we have right now araya said
