update 1-pjm will test u.s. mid atlantic/midwest power grid for resiliency
adds comment from department of energy paragraphs and by scott disavino april reuters the operator of the biggest power grid said on monday it would study fuel security vulnerabilities in its and midwest system and if needed compensate generators for the resiliency their units provide
we do not feel we have a vulnerability today but will take a look at the system to see if we could have fuel security issues in the future andy ott president and ceo of pjm interconnection said in a conference call
the fuel mix used to generate power in pjm which serves million people has changed over the past several years with coal and nuclear plants retiring as energy firms add more natural gas and renewable units
that transition has caused economic pain for owners of the retiring units like firstenergy inc along with concern by some in the administration of president donald trump that the grid is becoming more vulnerable to the loss of a big gas pipeline or an extreme weather event
firstenergy in march asked energy secretary rick perry to evoke emergency powers to help several struggling nuclear and coal plants remain open including units owned by its firstenergy solutions subsidiary which sought bankruptcy protection just days after saying it would shut nuclear reactors in ohio and pennsylvania
we don t think there is an emergency today but we do think these are legitimate questions to ask ott said
pjm s ott described potential fuel security issues as those that could cut fuel supply to critical resources due to extreme weather conditions or physical or cyber attacks on power plants and gas pipelines
the energy department was encouraged by pjm s study said spokeswoman shaylyn hynes
premature retirements of nuclear and coal plants put the grid at risk and undermine national security she said
hynes urged the federal energy regulatory commission an independent agency of the energy department to take immediate action to stop the shutting of power plants
the energy department is reviewing its options to ensure that the grid can withstand extreme threats she added
pjm said it plans to complete its assessment over the next six months
it will the system under various fuel supply disruption scenarios to understand potential future reliability concerns
we have the ability to identify risks to the system and to put a value on resources that offset that risk ott said noting certain generators with weeks of fuel on hand or multiple sources of fuel could receive more money for the resiliency they provide
some coal plants for example keep weeks of fuel on hand or have access to mines on site
nuclear plants can hold up to two years worth of fuel in their reactors
some gas plants can also burn oil and have access to multiple pipelines gas straight out of the ground and liquefied natural gas supplies
