analysis-brazil ethanol sales to japan to sputter as tokyo woos trump
sao paulo reuters brazil ethanol producers stand to lose a big chunk of their largest market japan to agribusiness after tokyo bent to pressure from president donald trump and tweaked requirements for gasoline additives
until recently nearly all the ethanol used to make ethyl ether etbe for japanese consumption has come from brazil whose ethanol boasts lower emissions of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than ethanol made from corn
but in japan s government loosened emissions requirements on etbe while its prime minister was visiting the united states
brazilian cane industry group unica accused tokyo of backsliding on environmental controls
but american ethanol producers cheered the move a rare trade victory for farmers who have suffered much of the blowback from washington s escalating trade row with china
for the first time the ethanol industry will have the opportunity to compete for a portion of japan s fuel blending market said emily skor head of ethanol group growth energy in a statement
brazilian cane producers are the latest casualties in a trade dispute kicked off by trump last year
china boosted imports of brazilian soybeans and threatened tariffs on soybeans
steep duties on sorghum imports made shippers find new homes for bulk vessels worth more than million that were already en route to china
japan s new ethanol rules started with a public consultation last year to review fuel blending standards
however a senior brazilian diplomat said on condition of anonymity that brasilia had expected the move as a way for japan to ease trump s concerns about that country s trade surplus with the united states
due to the large trade deficit it was clear that ethanol could be one of those products used to reduce the imbalance the diplomat said
japan consumes nearly percent of brazil s ethanol exports or about million liters annually including the volumes used for etbe much of which is made by producers
much of the etbe used in japan is already made in the united states using brazilian sugarcane ethanol so the new rules should make it easy for producers to switch quickly to sources
a department of agriculture usda report said the japanese policy change could create a market opportunity for ethanol producers of million liters valued at around million
in the end whatever you take away from brazil you give to the an ethanol export trader said
the shift adds to rising tension in the ethanol industry
last year brazil slapped a percent tariff on exports in an effort to slow flows
even with the tariff ethanol exports hit a record high in february thanks largely to rising brazilian demand as higher gasoline prices and low international sugar prices made ethanol more competitive at the pump
