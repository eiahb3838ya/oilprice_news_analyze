column-lack of fuel subsidies could hasten asian crude demand destruction: russell
the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
by clyde russell launceston australia april reuters the term demand destruction is again entering the lexicon of the current crude oil market as the sharp rise in prices raises concerns about when do consumers start cutting back on their fuel consumption
while it s probably impossible to pick the exact point at which this happens the risk in the current cycle of rising prices is that it happens earlier than in the past in asia the main region driving rising crude demand
the reason for this is that many countries in asia used the prior period of falling crude prices to end or dramatically scale back their fuel subsidies
this means that this time consumers in countries such as india indonesia and malaysia are fully exposed to rising crude prices something that hasn t been in the case in previous bull cycles
the combined oil consumption of those three countries is about million barrels per day bpd with india alone accounting for about million bpd
even a percent drop in demand for fuel in those countries would knock about bpd from global crude oil consumption
so far it appears that consumers in those countries haven t been exposed to the full extent of the crude oil increase
global benchmark brent crude closed at a barrel on april up percent since the end of last year and percent from last year s low in june
the price of a litre of diesel in new delhi was rupees on sunday according to data on the website of indian oil
this is equivalent to about a litre
at the end of last year the price of a litre of diesel was rupees meaning it has risen by percent so far this year not quite keeping pace with the rise in brent crude oil
when crude was at its low in june diesel was rupees a litre in new delhi meaning it has risen about percent since then while brent has jumped by percent
what appears to have happened is that the oil majors such as indian oil have largely absorbed the cost of rising crude prices partly because of government pressure to do so
but there has to be a question mark as to how long this can continue to be the case
indian oil s share price has plunged percent since its high reached in august and there will likely come a point where the pain of the slumping stock price outweighs the political pressure to keep absorbing the cost of higher crude oil prices
there is also some preliminary evidence that india s appetite for crude oil is levelling off with imports trending lower so far this year according to and port data compiled by thomson reuters oil research and forecasts
for the first days of april the data which has been filtered to show only cargoes that have been discharged show imports running at million bpd
this is down from million bpd in march million bpd in february and million bpd in january
while there may be some seasonal slowing in india s crude demand it s worth noting that april this year appears to be slightly weaker than the million bpd imported in the same month in
in indonesia which ended gasoline subsidies in and lowered the diesel subsidy to rupiah cents per litre in retail prices also haven t risen by as much as the price of crude oil
diesel was about the equivalent of about cents a litre last week up from cents at the start of the year according to data on the website
similar to india this means indonesian consumers have only been partially slugged the increase in the price of crude oil meaning the fuel retailer has been absorbing the difference via shrinking profit margins
again how much longer this can continue is uncertain but one would imagine at some point rising crude prices will have to be reflected in higher retail prices for diesel and gasoline
even when retail fuel prices do rise picking the exact level at which consumers cut back on usage either directly by driving or flying less or indirectly by purchasing fewer goods and services as they divert income to rising fuel bills is a challenge and will vary from country to country
but the absence of fuel subsidies in most asian nations is likely to mean the region feels the pain of the jump in crude prices far faster than was the case previously
