offshore wind power firms see taiwan as a battleground to expand in asia
copenhagen reuters taiwan is becoming the next battleground for the world s top offshore wind developers as they seek a foothold in asia for a technology that has been expanding fast in europe
taiwan announced results on monday of its first major offshore wind farm auction that aims to add gigawatts gw of capacity to its existing network of just megawatts mw
the island s offshore wind market is expected to expand to gw by and the government aims to invest billion on onshore and offshore wind projects by law firm jones day says
taiwan is making a big push to attract investments in renewable technology as it phases out nuclear power by after the fukushima disaster in japan highlighted the risks of using nuclear energy in a region prone to earthquakes
for developers in europe where expanding offshore wind projects particularly in the north sea has driven down costs taiwan is seen as a route into asian markets such as japan and south korea where the technology is still barely used
denmark s orsted and germany s wpd were monday s biggest winners securing contracts to install mw and gw of capacity respectively
we see taiwan as a stepping stone into said matthias bausenwein the regional general manager for orsted the world s largest owner of offshore wind power sites that was previously known as dong energy
graphic taiwan s auction drew bids from the world s biggest international players attracted by the island s strong winds a stable regulatory framework and the offer of power purchase agreements with a above european benchmarks
we have aggressive targets in taiwan and with things going on in china south korea and other markets that amounts to it becoming the region globally said bausenwein
offshore wind power is costlier than onshore projects or solar power and still only accounts for about percent of global wind energy capacity
but europe has been leading the way in using the technology adding gw last year and taking total offshore capacity to gw according to the global wind energy council
costs have plunged as a result
in last week s auction in germany the world s second biggest offshore wind power market some bids offered capacity with no subsidies
in britain the world s biggest market the cost of wind power fell below new nuclear generation for the first time last year
this has been encouraged by an expanding regional grid greater ability to manage variable wind power supplies and the growing scale of turbines expected to have capacity of to mw each in two or three years roughly twice as powerful as today
taiwan is not considering firms from china the world s third biggest offshore market and which claims taiwan as chinese territory
chen director of the energy technology division at taiwan s bureau of energy said chinese bids were excluded due to concerns of national security
alongside orsted and wpd other bidders included copenhagen infrastructure partners canada s northland power yushan energy a subsidiary of singapore based enterprize energy and taiwanese firms china steel cooperation and taipower
after awarding gw capacity on monday a further gw will be allocated through a competitive price tender this summer
monday s auction had included an assessment of factors such as the amount of local content included
european firms want local suppliers to avoid the cost of shipping bulky equipment used in the turbines from europe
the requirements for local content are increasing step by step said andreas nauen offshore chief executive for siemens gamesa adding some european equipment would initially be used
siemens gamesa is working to develop the port of taichung as a regional hub and has signed agreements with some local partners that could provide gear locally
mhi vestas a venture between japan s mitsubishi heavy industries and danish turbine maker vestas is also considering developing local manufacturing
we want to produce locally because we want to be competitive the joint venture s chief executive philippe kavafyan told reuters
