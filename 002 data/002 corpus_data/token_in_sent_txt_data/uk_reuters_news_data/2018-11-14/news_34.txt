oil prices continue sliding on wednesday novak says prices are benchmark for decision on output russia has cut oil production by bpd in nov from oct adds detail quotes by vladimir soldatkin singapore nov reuters russia s energy minister said on wednesday no emergency action was warranted to stem a decline in oil prices as crude benchmarks fell again
alexander novak reporters on the sideline of an international conference in singapore that oil prices should be taken into consideration when any decision was taken by oil producing countries
he was talking as oil markets fell again extending losses from a percent plunge the previous session as surging supply and the spectre of faltering demand scared off investors
novak said oil prices had averaged around per barrel this year
the market is quite volatile today
we remember that the oil price was sharply rising in the same way now it is going down
we have to look into development into how the price will be stabilised he said
it s not right for market participants to react to any fluctuations he said
novak also said the oil market still did not fully understand the fallout from sanctions against iran and how buyers would behave
the united states announced the reinstatement of sanctions earlier this month against iran over tehran s activities in the middle east
eight importing countries have been given temporary exemptions by the united states to keep buying iranian oil prompting iranian president hassan rouhani to say washington would not be able to cut iran s oil exports to zero
i think the market is volatile due to a lot of uncertainty novak said
he said russia had been cutting oil production by around barrels per day so far in november from the record high of million bpd in october
