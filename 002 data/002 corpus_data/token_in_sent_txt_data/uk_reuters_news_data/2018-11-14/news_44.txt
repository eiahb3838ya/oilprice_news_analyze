refile-graphic-asia's weakening economies, record supply threaten to create oil glut
singapore reuters oil traders worries over record supplies arriving in asia just as the outlook for its key growth economies weakens have pulled down global crude benchmarks by a quarter since early october
data shows a record of more than million barrels per day bpd of crude oil hitting asia s main markets in november up around percent since january and an increase of nearly percent since the start of this year
much of this oil was ordered ahead of sanctions against iran that were imposed this month as refiners prepared for a sudden drop in supply
but with unexpectedly broad exemptions granted by washington that allow asia s main oil consumers to continue buying crude from iran the overall supply drop has not materialised
global supply has instead surged led by soaring output from the world s producers the united states russia and saudi arabia who in october broke through joint output of million bpd for the first time meeting more than a third of total oil consumption
that surge has so far been met by healthy demand not only in asia s main emerging economies of china and india but also in the mature markets of japan and south korea
now though the rising supplies are threatening to turn into a glut triggering a percent in spot crude contracts since early october as financial traders pulled money out of oil markets
analysts warn the situation may get worse with increasing signs of a slowdown across asia s biggest economies
momentum still appears to be slowing across the region reflecting a combination of tighter financial conditions and slowing global trade said frederic neumann of economic research for asia at hsbc in hong kong
economic china asia s biggest economy may see its first fall in car sales on record in as consumption is stifled amid a trade war between washington and beijing
in japan the economy contracted in the third quarter hit by natural disasters but also by a decline in exports amid the rising protectionism that is starting to take its toll on global trade
and in india a plunging rupee has resulted in surging import costs including for oil stifling purchases in one of asia s biggest emerging markets
india s car sales are also set to register a fall this year
while over the past few months the focus was on the iran embargo and venezuela s output struggles
the risks of too little supply the market now increasingly looks concerned about the prospects of too much supply said norbert ruecker head of commodity research at swiss bank julius baer
hedge funds and other speculative money have swiftly changed from the long to the short side he said
as recently as september and october leading oil traders and analysts were forecasting oil prices of or even a barrel by
since then there has been a dramatic shift in sentiment that has turned the entire forward curve for crude oil upside down
spot prices in september were significantly higher than those for forward deliveries a structure known as backwardation that implies a tight market as it is unattractive to put oil into storage
by this week the curve had flipped into contango when crude prices for immediate buys are cheaper than those for later dispatch
that implies an oversupplied market in which it is attractive to store oil for later sale
hsbc s neumann said the outlook heading into remained downcast economic activity continues to decelerate which likely curtails underlying energy demand growth for a graphic brent curve in sept vs nov https reporting by henning gloystein editing by tom hogue
