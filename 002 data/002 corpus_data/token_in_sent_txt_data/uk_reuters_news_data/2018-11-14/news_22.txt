fish and chips under threat from plastic-clogged seas, uk charity warns
london reuters britain s fish and chips one of the nation s favourite staples is under threat from the deluge of plastic waste that is choking seas and endangering marine life a leading environmental charity warned on wednesday
to highlight the risk plastic oceans uk teamed up with a chippie in the northern city of blackburn to serve hungry customers battered plastic instead of the usual cod with their chips
the amount of plastic reaching the ocean threatens not only the future of fish but our future too
if we continue at this rate not only will our beloved national dish be a thing of the past but we ll be facing other catastrophic problems for our planet said geoff brighty technical director of plastic oceans uk
plastic oceans futurefishandchips campaign is the latest in a string of global efforts by environmental groups and the united nations to pare back use that is also clogging landfills
big brands from coke to kellogs have also pledged to cut all plastic waste from their operations as public pressure mounts for manufacturers and retailers
when you look at how much plastic is now believed to be entering into the environment it s somewhere between four and million tons every year and it s projected to grow to over million tons by which is a considerable amount of material to go into the oceans and we can already see it s causing impacts on beaches and in fisheries brighty said
so it s not too much of a stretch of imagination to think that if we don t stop this it will start to impact on fish populations and fish the hungry customers served up battered plastic were initially irate but appreciated the stunt when it was explained to them
you watch television and you see the oceans and go on social media and see all these bottles all over the place but then until it s actually served on a plate to you it s just kind of it s a bit of an eye opener when you find out what it s really about one of the customers said
