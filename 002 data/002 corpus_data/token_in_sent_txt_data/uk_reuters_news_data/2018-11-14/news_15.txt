national guard to help search for remains from california's deadliest wildfire
paradise nov reuters national guard troops were due to arrive on wednesday to help search for more victims in the charred ruins where the northern california town of paradise stood before it was erased in the deadliest most destructive wildfire in state history
the guard contingent about military police trained to look for and identify human remains will reinforce the recovery teams cadaver dogs and forensic anthropologists already scouring the ghostly landscape of a fire that has killed at least people
the grim painstaking search is concentrated in what little is left of paradise a sierra foothills town in butte county california about miles km north of san francisco that was overrun by flames and largely incinerated last thursday
the killer blaze fueled by thick scrub and fanned by fierce winds capped a catastrophic california wildfire season that experts largely attribute to prolonged dry spells they say are symptomatic of global climate change
the butte county disaster coincided with a flurry of blazes in southern california most notably the woolsey fire which has killed two people destroyed over structures and displaced about people in the mountains and foothills near the malibu coast west of los angeles
the origins of both the camp and woolsey fires were listed as under investigation
but two utility companies southern california edison and pacific gas electric reported to regulators they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas around the time the blazes were reported to have started
by late tuesday with the help of diminished winds and rising humidity levels fire crews had managed to carve containment lines around more than a third of both fires easing further the immediate threat to life and property

interior secretary ryan zinke and california governor jerry brown were scheduled on wednesday to pay a visit to the areas which president donald trump declared a disaster areas making federal emergency assistance more readily available
after touring some of california s earlier wildfire zones in august zinke blamed gross mismanagement of forests because of timber harvest restrictions that he said were supported by environmental terrorist groups
while prospects for suppressing the flames grew more hopeful authorities pressed on with the task of accounting for those listed as missing
county sheriff kory honea said he requested the guard troops along with disaster mortuary crew portable military morgue teams and specialists from a private dna laboratory to speed the detection and identification of additional remains
we want to cover as much ground as we can honea said at a tuesday evening news conference where he announced that the six latest sets of remains had been recovered in paradise earlier in the day
the fatality count of already far exceeds the previous record for the greatest loss of life from a single wildfire in california history people killed by the griffith park fire in los angeles in
honea said that in some cases victims were burned beyond recognition or even beyond the use of fingerprint ids
dental records will be needed to positively identify some but dental records might not be available if the dentist office burned to the ground he said
we re finding remains in various states he told reporters
people have been badly burned
some of them i assume have been he said it was possible that some remains might turn up only once residents with homes still intact are able to return
more than remained under evacuation orders
honea had previously said people were listed as missing
however he said on tuesday night those numbers were highly fluid and that his office planned to publish a new list of missing persons soon and would ask the public to help account for them
he said it remained unclear how many individuals whose whereabouts were unknown had perished or fallen out of touch in chaotic evacuations
flames roared through paradise so swiftly that residents were forced to flee for their lives with little or no warning
bodies of some victims were found in and around the wreckage of vehicles engulfed in the firestorm as evacuation traffic ground to a half in deadly knots of gridlock hours after the fire erupted
by late tuesday the camp fire had blackened acres hectares in all
the woolsey fire by comparison has scorched acres hectares of rolling hills and canyons spanning ventura and los angeles counties an area roughly the size of denver
on tuesday forensic teams fanned out to pick through the barren lots in a town once home to people
on a residential street in paradise lined with obliterated houses a search crew wearing white protective suits and red helmets used a dog to scour the debris
look for skulls the big bones one forensics worker said to others as they used metal poles and their hands to sift through ruins
at a nearby community swimming pool recovery workers stirred green darkened waters with long poles to probe for bodies
