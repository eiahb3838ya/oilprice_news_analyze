the project includes construction of miles km of new pipeline two compressor stations and replacement of miles of existing pipeline
one billion cubic feet is enough gas to power about million homes for a day
new pipelines built to remove gas from the marcellus and utica basins have enabled shale drillers to boost output in the appalachia region to a forecast record high of around bcfd in december from bcfd during the same month a year earlier
that represents about percent of the nation s total dry gas output of bcfd expected on average in
a decade ago the appalachia region produced just bcfd or percent of the country s total production in
