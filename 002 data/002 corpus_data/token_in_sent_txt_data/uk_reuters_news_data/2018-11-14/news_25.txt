the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london nov reuters natural gas prices have leapt to the highest level for more than four years as the market tries to conserve scarce gas stocks in the face of unusually cold weather settling across much of the country
futures prices for gas delivered at henry hub in january have surged to more than per million british thermal units up from just at the start of the month and the highest since july
gas stocks are at the lowest seasonal level for years and around percent lower than at the same point last year and the average according to data from the energy information administration
while most forecasters have been predicting a relatively mild winter across the northern united states because of the el niño developing over the pacific temperatures have recently fallen far below the seasonal average
until the end of the first week in november temperatures had been slightly milder than the average and in line with the start of winter in and
since then however temperatures have plunged well below normal across most of the lower states pushing cumulative heating demand up sharply
colder than average weather is expected to persist across most northern and eastern population centres for the next week according to the government s climate prediction center
if the forecast is correct this will be the first colder than average start for over three years and increase the pressure on gas supplies
the confluence of unusually cold weather with very low gas stocks has sent gas prices surging as the market tries to limit consumption as much as possible
rising prices should encourage power producers to limit the number of hours they run in the next few weeks to conserve stocks while price differentials should result in maximum switching to coal generation
if benchmark gas prices rise high enough they could also discourage lng exports
but low inventories have left the market very vulnerable with price spikes likely to recur later in the winter to cope with any extended periods of cold weather
as a result hedge fund managers have a clear bullish bias on prices this winter with long positions still outnumbering short ones by a ratio of more than last week only slightly below the peak of set in
