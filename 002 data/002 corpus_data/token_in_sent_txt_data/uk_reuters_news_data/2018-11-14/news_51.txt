update 1-eu's malmstrom assumes u.s. won't slap autos tariffs during talks
washington reuters the european union s trade commissioner cecilia malmstrom said on tuesday she assumes the united states will not slap auto tariffs on the eu while the two sides are negotiating on trade even as the trump administration considers options to shield the auto industry from imports
malmstrom told an audience at the german marshall fund in washington that any move by the united states to impose auto tariffs would not apply to the eu due to an agreement in july between president donald trump and european commission president juncker
we assume that if that auto tariffs were to happen that would not be for the european union she said
senior trump administration officials on tuesday discussed the commerce department s draft recommendations on its section national security probe into the autos sector which have been submitted to the white house and are being reviewed by various federal agencies
two administration officials said no decisions were made at the meeting on tuesday and no announcement is planned
the contents of the recommendations have not been disclosed
the advancement of commerce s autos report which trump has said could lead to tariffs on imported cars and parts of up to percent was seen as a way to ramp up pressure for better trade terms with the eu and japan one administration official told reuters on monday
malmstrom who is meeting with trade representative robert lighthizer on wednesday to pursue more regulatory cooperation and discuss what future trade negotiations might cover said she would be willing to include autos but made clear that any trade deal would be limited in scope covering industrial goods
it would be limited and let me state and be very clear it will not include agriculture she said
any deal on regulatory cooperation to facilitate more trade or on eu purchases of soybeans and liquefied natural gas would be done outside of the trade negotiations as a voluntary arrangement malmstrom said
these areas were outlined during the meeting in july
malmstrom said she would need a mandate from eu governments to launch formal negotiations with the united states and many eu members notably france are opposed to including agriculture in the talks
lighthizer is now consulting with congress on eu negotiations which can not begin until a fast track notification period expires in january
