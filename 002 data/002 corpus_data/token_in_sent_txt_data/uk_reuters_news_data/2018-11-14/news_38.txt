russia's novak says no emergency action warranted to halt oil price decline
singapore nov reuters russian energy minister alexander novak said oil prices should be taken into consideration when any decision is taken by countries and no emergency action to stem a decline in oil prices is warranted
he was talking as oil markets fell again on wednesday extending losses from a percent plunge the previous session as surging supply and the spectre of faltering demand scared off investors
novak said oil prices have averaged around per barrel this year
the market is quite volatile today
we remember that the oil price was sharply rising in the same way now it is going down
we have to look into development into how the price will be stabilised he told reporters on the sideline of an international conference in singapore
it s not right for market participants to react to any fluctuations he said
he also said that the oil market still does not fully understand the fallout from the sanctions against iran and how buyers will behave
he said that russia has been cutting oil production by around barrels per day so far in november
