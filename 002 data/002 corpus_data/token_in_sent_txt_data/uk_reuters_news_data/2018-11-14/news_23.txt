update 1-pg&e shares dive after utility flags impact from camp wildfire
reuters shares of utility pg e corp fell percent on wednesday after the company warned of liquidity concerns if its equipment was found responsible for starting the camp wildfire currently raging in california
the company said liabilities related to the wildfires could exceed its recently renewed insurance cover adding to the severe financial pressure it is already facing
the utility has already withdrawn billion from its credit line in anticipation of liabilities leaving it with no additional money available under its credit agreements it said in a filing
the camp wildfire which has killed nearly people is being investigated and pg e told regulators it experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas around the time the blazes were reported to have started
nbc said in a report on tuesday that a day before the fire started pg e emailed a local landowner about problems with sparks and the need for workers to enter her property and work on the lines
the company however was unable to address the issue as the landowner was out of town the report said
the company said in the filing it had renewed liability insurance coverage for wildfire events of about billion for the period from through july
pg e did not immediately respond to requests for comment
the company already faces billions of dollars in potential payouts from lawsuits after california said pg e s power lines were responsible for sparking last year s wildfires
