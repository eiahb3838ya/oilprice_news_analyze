update 1-petrobras could get about $7.9 bln from contract revision -source
adds details of the contract context by marcela ayres brasilia nov reuters brazilian oil company petroleo brasileiro sa could receive some billion reais billion from the government in a renegotiation of the transfer of rights oil contract a person following the process told reuters on wednesday
the money to pay petrobras as the company is known would come from a potential auction of excess oil from the transfer of rights area off the brazilian coast according to the source part of the team working on the transition to a new government in brazil
the person who requested anonymity said such an auction could raise billion to billion reais next year if the necessary legislation clears congress
american depositary receipts for petrobras shares added to gains on the news rising percent in new york
brazil s senate has a bill that would open the way for the auction and possibly for the payment to petrobras
a dispute over the oil in question dates back to when the brazilian government granted petrobras the right to extract billion barrels of oil and gas in the offshore santos basin
the government received additional shares in petrobras in return based on oil prices at the time
but volume of oil is now estimated to be much larger and the government wants to sell the rights to extract the extra oil in the area
the choice reserves can not be auctioned until the government and petrobras resolve a dispute over the transaction
among other things the contract stipulated that costs would be reviewed after the area was declared commercially viable in which has led to years of sparring as oil prices have fluctuated
the senate bill also includes a provision allowing petrobras to cede up to a percent stake in the area to other oil firms
