wrapup 8-don't deal in venezuelan gold, white house says, in anti-maduro push
reuters the white house warned traders on wednesday not to deal in venezuelan gold or oil following its imposition of stiff sanctions aimed at forcing socialist president nicolas maduro from power
national security adviser john bolton tweeted that traders should not deal in gold oil or other commodities being stolen from the venezuelan people as opponents of maduro s government worried that a plane had shipped gold out of caracas on wednesday afternoon
the white house said president donald trump spoke to venezuela s interim president juan guaido by phone on wednesday reiterating support for his fight to regain on one side of the tussle for control of venezuela an opec member that has the world s largest oil reserves but is in dire financial straits guaido and western backers led by the united states are insisting on an immediate transition and fresh elections
on the other maduro with backing from russia china and turkey says he will remain for his second term despite accusations of fraud in his last year and the economic meltdown
venezuela s struggle to pay its debts even to allies russia and china amid a sharp drop in oil output has been exacerbated by the new sanctions which will make it very hard to sell oil to its main client the united states
in that context the arrival in caracas of a boeing plane from moscow on monday led to speculation maduro s government was shipping more gold reserves out of the country following shipments of million of gold to turkey last year
that was part of a strategy to increase the central bank s liquidity
the flight operated by russia s nordwind airlines left venezuela at pm local time gmt a reuters witness said
another flight a boeing cargo plane arrived at the airport an hour earlier via cape verde according to flight data
there are no routine flights between the two countries
venezuelan lawmaker jose guerra a former central bank economist told the national assembly his understanding was that the nordwind plane would take some gold reserves to russia
the bank did not respond to a request for comment
sources told reuters private military contractors who do secret missions for moscow were in venezuela last week
elliott abrams the envoy for venezuela said washington was looking around the world for more assets of the maduro government including gold holdings and bank accounts
the kremlin said this week it expected venezuela to pay its debts
russia which like china has loaned and invested billions of dollars to opec member venezuela called on guaido to drop his demand for a snap election and instead accept mediation
but given the failure of previous rounds of dialogue between the government and opposition including one led by the vatican opponents are suspicious believing maduro uses them to quell protests and buy time
guaido s envoy to the united states carlos vecchio said the only dialogue they were interested in would be a negotiation for maduro s departure and new elections
government officials insist the next presidential election will be in
responding to a call by guaido tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across venezuela on wednesday some waving venezuelan flags while drivers of cars and buses honked in support
i want this government to go it has been a total humiliation for the country said lucy cordoba a government worker in the poor hillside town of petare at the edge of the capital where she said trash had not been collected for a year and water was scarce
cordoba said her children were among the more than million venezuelans who have left the country in the past couple of years
one went to peru and another to the dominican republic
more than people have died so far in and around the protests that began a week ago the human rights office said
hundreds have also been arrested including children
white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said trump and guaido agreed to maintain regular communication after venezuelan authorities opened an investigation that could lead to guaido s arrest
abrams said action against guaido would be oil prices rose nearly percent on wednesday as investors remained concerned about supply disruptions
wills rangel a board member of state oil company pdvsa told reuters the company was having problems unloading fuel imports because the sanctions were complicating payments
maduro says guaido is staging a coup against him
he told moscow s ria news agency on wednesday that trump ordered the government of colombia and the colombian mafia to kill me reprising an accusation of plots he has made over the years and which bogota and washington routinely deny
maduro is not expected to stand down while he has the backing of senior military officers and has made daily visits to troops
do you want to be a coward he yelled in a call and response session with hundreds of soldiers on wednesday
no president they shouted back
