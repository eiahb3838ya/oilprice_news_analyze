update 1-canada paid high price for oil pipeline, faces delay risks -watchdog
winnipeg manitoba reuters the canadian government paid a high price for the trans mountain oil pipeline last summer and delays in expanding it could reduce its resale value a watchdog on the country s public finances said on thursday
prime minister justin trudeau s government purchased the trans mountain pipeline and a related expansion in august from kinder morgan canada fearing the company might abandon the capacity expansion
the project and others like it have faced stiff opposition in canada from environmental groups and some local governments
the canadian government paid c billion for the pipeline related assets and the expansion project and intends to eventually sell it
the pipeline running from alberta s hub to the vancouver british columbia area is actually worth between c billion and c billion the parliamentary budget officer pbo said in an analysis
expansion is likely to cost c billion for an date at the end of the pbo wrote
delays in construction however could reduce its value it said
herbert a spokesperson for finance minister bill morneau noted that the pbo s analysis did not include the benefit that moving oil to new markets would have on canada s economy
most canadian oil ships to the united states but an expanded trans mountain may allow for greater asian sales
when the political risks made it too difficult for the private sector to move forward and after extensive due diligence our government acquired the project herbert said
congested pipelines depressed canadian oil prices severely last year causing the alberta government to impose mandatory production cuts this month
the opposition conservative party chastised trudeau in a statement saying he overpaid for the pipeline
in the past the conservatives have criticized the liberal prime minister for doing too little to help the struggling industry
an appeals court last summer overturned the government s approval for expanding trans mountain saying the national energy board needed to address risks to marine life and government must better consult indigenous people
after a new review the board is scheduled to report to trudeau s cabinet next month
