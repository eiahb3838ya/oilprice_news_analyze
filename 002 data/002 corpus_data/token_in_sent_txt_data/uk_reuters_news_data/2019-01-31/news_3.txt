update 1-u.s. warns venezuela's maduro about intimidation, 'looting'
adds quotes from official context throughout by roberta rampton and doina chiacu washington jan reuters the government on thursday warned venezuelan president nicolas maduro of consequences for what it called egregious acts of intimidation and said russia and other countries should cease looting of oil and gold
juan guaido venezuela s interim president said on thursday that agents from a feared special police unit had visited his home
such acts of intimidation are seen as very serious very egregious by the united states a senior administration official told reporters on a conference call
there will be consequences for those engaged in such acts they will be held accountable and they will be missing this unique opportunity to move speaking on condition of anonymity the official urged venezuelan military officials to accept guaido s offer of amnesty if they backed his claim
so far the venezuelan military has remained loyal to maduro
the united states and most other western nations have backed guaido s push for a transition and new elections
but russia and china among others are supporting maduro
washington also warned maduro russia and other international players against making deals for venezuelan commodities like gold and oil
the arrival of an unusual russian plane in caracas this week sparked rumors denied by russia that gold was being shipped out the country
venezuela is selling gold from its central bank vaults to the united arab emirates in coming days in return for euros in cash a source said
the government wants venezuela oil company pdvsa s subsidiary citgo to keep operational despite tough new sanctions it imposed earlier this week
our goal is to ensure that citgo remains viable but to make sure that maduro and his cronies are not able to loot citgo in the way that they ve been looting it for years the official said adding that the was also looking at further economic sanctions
the official said maduro and a dozen other venezuelan officials were standing in the way of a political transition and the government was open to conversations about how to help them leave the country
but the government rejects recent suggestions that uruguay mexico or the vatican should play a mediating role between maduro and guaido the official said
we explicitly reject any talk about any type of effort that would allow nicolas maduro to usurp or maintain himself in power or be a political player in that regard the official said
maduro who has been in power since and began a second term earlier this month after disputed elections last year has said guaido s actions are an attempt at a coup
