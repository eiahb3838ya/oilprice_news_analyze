environmentalists blame a rapid expansion of indonesian palm plantations for a massive clearance of forests that were home to endangered tigers and elephants
a challenge from indonesia on the policy would escalate its efforts to safeguard sales to its palm oil market
the eu accounted for around percent of indonesia s total palm exports of more than billion last year
siregar said palm oil will be labelled a high risk crop indicating its potential to result in deforestation in an act attached to red ii due to be issued in early february
indonesia will challenge both red ii and the act at the wto s dispute settlement body after it is issued he said
the wto body can order members to remove any trade barriers if it finds that the policies breach free trade rules
a government document outlining indonesia s stance on the eu policy and reviewed by reuters said the method used to assess indirect land use change iluc which aims to measure the risk of unintended carbon emissions was not internationally recognized and not applicable in a tropical region

indonesia s foreign minister retno marsudi said in a letter to the association of southeast asian nations asean that developments in the eu hurting the interests of asean palm states have caused it to defer elevation of dialogue relations to a strategic the letter also reviewed by reuters urged other members of asean to follow suit
all relationships will be overviewed related to that discriminative policy by the eu siregar said
asked about the letter a spokesman at the asean secretariat in jakarta said it is up to the member states to rafael de bustamante tello first counsellor at the eu embassy in jakarta said the eu considers the red ii to be in line with the eu s international commitments including its wto the european commission will make sure achievement of the eu s renewable energy goals goes hand in hand with the fair and international trade regime that we so strongly defend he said
de bustamante also said that during an ministerial meeting in brussels last week the two blocs decided to form a new joint working group to address issues related to palm oil
in january last year the wto ruled in favor of indonesia on several challenges to duties that the eu had imposed on its biodiesel exports
the duties had effectively stopped the trade but exporters were able to resume shipments to europe around april
