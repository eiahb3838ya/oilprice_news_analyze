trans-gambia bridge a boon for trade, but a blow for local traders
gambia reuters a gleaming new bridge in west africa is transforming transport between gambia and senegal but spells disaster for traders making a living off travellers making the agonising wait to catch a ferry across the gambia river
gambia is a sliver of land on either side of the river cutting through the middle of the much larger senegal the product of a deal between britain and france staking a claim to each
the absurd geography means anyone crossing from northern to southern senegal or has to enter gambia and before the bridge join long queues to cross the river
the wait for the ferry could take up to a week
the km senegambia bridge which opened to cars and minibuses last week changed all that
i m happy about this bridge traveller amadou bah said of the concrete structure stretching high over the river from one shore to the other
vehicles just come and pass without any trucks will not be allowed on the bridge until july and drivers can hardly wait
a few months ago i spent days at the ferry terminal before it was my time to cross senegalese truck driver mawdo saine told reuters as he waited to board a boat at barra a rusting ferry terminal on the sandy riverbank
that s a lot of difficulty for us drivers because what you should do in one week you end up doing in one the bridge is also a welcome success for gambia one of the poorest countries in west africa after more than two decades of dictatorship
but ferry operators and food vendors who serve the river traffic are struggling
wuyeh jaiteh who supports a large extended family says he used to make west african francs pounds a day from ferrying people across the river
but since last week his customers have disappeared
today is my third day here that i have not gone home because there is nothing to take to the family jaiteh said
i will have to spend the jaiteh admitted the bridge was good for development but like other traders said he would need government help
for years i have been selling at this place walking around to sell stuff like torches and perfume hawker bubacarr jallow said
we are appealing to the government to see how to help us because this is what we depend on for our writing by juliette jabkhiro editing by tim cocks and robin pomeroy
