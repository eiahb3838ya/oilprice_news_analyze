the company which operates three refineries and distributes fuel to more than gasoline stations across states recognizable by a red triangle logo has become the largest potential casualty from sanctions on venezuela
the trump administration ordered citgo profits to be retained to pressure maduro to step down
it also barred customers from transferring payment to pdvsa depriving the nation its largest source of cash
citgo imports crude from pdvsa in exchange for refined products which raises the possibility that citgo would be without a third of its crude supplies after a grace period ends
employees at the firms refineries say they have been advised by managers to ignore the furor
but the pressure is now threatening citgo operations from its capacity and plant management to debt refinancing and commercial relationships according to the people close to the matter

however citgo has been struggling to refinance a revolving line of credit a task that must be completed by july according to people close to the matter
pdvsa also faces a million interest bond payment in april though the sanctions could prevent a foreclosure sale of citgo shares in event of a default said mark weidemaier a professor at the university of north carolina school of law
