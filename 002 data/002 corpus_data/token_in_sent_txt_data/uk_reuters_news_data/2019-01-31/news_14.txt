liberal insiders say as a result of the feedback from the town halls where attendees can also jot down their concerns on paper policy tweaks are already being considered
public unhappiness over illegal immigrants crossing the border from the united states is so great that the party will consider a promise to clamp down further even though ottawa considers the matter is under control said one top liberal
widespread complaints about the lack of affordable housing are likely to produce a commitment for more spending said the liberal who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation
the verdict from voters is definitely mixed judging by trudeau s experiences as he travelled the country in january taking questions from a practise he says helps him break out of what he calls the ottawa bubble

we used to hang them hang them for treason the woman told the stunned prime minister after asking him about moslem sharia law and saudi arabian oil imports

liberals like the town halls on the grounds they demonstrate trudeau is not afraid to take tough questions
yet they also admit the exchanges show voters have more urgent concerns than topics such as gender equality climate change and the aboriginal rights that trudeau has been pushing hard at home and abroad since he took power in
we need to focus on things that are of interest to all canadians and not just some of them conceded a second liberal
while trudeau has emerged as one of the world s leading progressive leaders at home canadians are concentrating more on their jobs and taxes said bricker
infrastructure minister champagne present in the hall at as abuse was levelled at trudeau conceded there is a level of anxiety out there and we need to allow for these discussions to but insiders say regardless of the insults trudeau intends to stick to his policy of avoiding public arguments

it s going to be tight the message to the troops is there is no magic commercial advert that is going to win this campaign
