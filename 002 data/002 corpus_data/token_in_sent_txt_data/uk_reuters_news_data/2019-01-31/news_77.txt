new indonesian insurance rules cause coal export backlogs in kalimantan
jakarta jan reuters indonesian insurance rules that come into effect on are causing huge coal supply backlogs with dozens of ships held up outside ports unable to load as authorities start checking to see if vessels are in compliance with the new policy
a regulation issued in august last year requires indonesian exporters of coal and palm oil to use local insurers from and also requires them to use local shipping companies from may
indonesia is the world s biggest exporter of thermal coal used mostly for power generation
the country exports between million and million tonnes of coal per month to its main customers in india china japan and south korea
hendra sinadia executive director of indonesian coal mining association told reuters that during an initial trial period beginning on friday exporters without indonesian insurers would not be penalised
port surveyors however were checking which exporters have proper insurance he said
sinadia said exports won t be disrupted and that the association was telling its members it was business as usual
coal traders though said the new insurance rules were already causing a considerable backlog in kalimantan indonesia s biggest region
it is pretty chaotic at the moment
some shippers haven t prepared their new insurance others have but the authorities and insurers are slow to register said one trader who exports kalimantan coal
there were not enough surveyors to handle the fleet of ships he said and insurers and port authorities were taking a long time to issue and recognise the new insurance documents
the main concern was the daily charter rate of a ship that sits idle for weeks running up a bill in the tens of thousands of dollar he said
more than two dozen large ships are currently sitting outside the port of samarinda in east kalimantan waiting to load coal according to refinitiv ship tracking data
the situation is similar in the south kalimantan ports of taboneo and bunati
indonesian coal prices have so far not been heavily affected traders said as asian supplies are ample
prices were hovering slightly above per tonne for most of january
add the usual port and mining constraints in kalimantan and you have many ships that have been sitting outside its ports for many weeks the trader said
most indonesian coal is sold on a fob basis where insurance is the responsibility of the buyer
pt bukit asam a coal miner that exports on an fob basis has recommended a number of indonesian insurance companies to their buyers said director adib ubaidillah
palm oil exporters meanwhile are still waiting for lists of insurers from the country s financial service authority according to togar sitanggang deputy chief of the indonesia palm association
