column-fed's patience should be a warning to investors: kemp
london reuters the federal reserve s promise to be patient as it determines how to adjust interest rates in future has been welcomed by investors fearful that an economic slowdown could preface a slide into recession
the central bank s statement issued following the conclusion of a meeting of the setting federal open market committee on has sparked a limited relief rally in equity markets
but the committee s decision to put rate hikes on hold at least for now is a bearish rather than bullish sign for the economy and confirms that the risk of recession is elevated
the committee s patience is a sign of how much the economic environment has already weakened since the autumn when it was planning to continue increasing rates in
in its press statement the committee noted that a sustained expansion of economic activity is the most likely outcome but it dropped language from previous meetings suggesting risks to the outlook were balanced
actions speak louder than words and the fed s decision to go on hold suggests it now senses greater risks to the downside than before and it is consistent with past interest rate cycles
chartbook before the onset of each of the last four recessions and the effective federal funds rate had peaked and was already falling by the time the business cycle turned down
in fact the federal funds rate peaked shortly before almost every recession since the limited exception was the recession starting in
peaking interest rates have often been a harbinger of an imminent recession as the fed responds to signs that the expansion is running out of momentum
in every one of those cases even interest rate reductions were not enough to prevent the economy turning down a few months later
so while the fed s promise to be patient will be welcome in the white house it is an indication of how much the outlook has already deteriorated and reinforces the reasons for investors to be cautious
