hit by sanctions, asia's iran crude oil imports drop to 3-yr low in 2018
singapore reuters iranian crude oil imports by asia s top four buyers dropped to the lowest volume in three years in amid sanctions on tehran but china and india stepped up imports in december after getting waivers from washington
asia s top four buyers of iranian crude china india japan and south korea imported a total million barrels per day bpd in down percent from the previous year data from the countries showed
that was the lowest since about million bpd in when a previous round of sanctions on iran led to a sharp drop in asian imports reuters data showed
the united states reimposed sanctions on iran s oil exports last november as it wants to negotiate a new nuclear deal with the country
officials have said they intend to reduce the islamic republic s oil exports to zero
on a monthly basis asia s imports from iran rebounded to a high of bpd in december as china and india stepped up purchases after washington granted eight countries waivers from the iranian sanctions for days from the start of november
we expect iranian exports to asia to remain stable at around barrels per day until may when the waivers expire said energy aspects analyst riccardo fabiani
in december china s imports climbed above bpd for the first time in three months while india s imports rose above bpd
japan and south korea did not import any iranian crude that month because they were still sorting out payment and shipping issues but the countries have resumed oil lifting from iran this month
during the period china can import up to bpd of iranian oil while india s imports are restricted to bpd
south korea can import up to bpd of iranian condensate
after may it will all depend on the administration s decisions which at the moment remain completely obscure
on balance they are likely to extend the current waivers although rumours are that there could be a significant cut in waivered volumes fabiani said
as a precaution indian oil corp the country s top refiner is looking for an annual deal to buy crude as it seeks to broaden its oil purchasing options its chairman said on wednesday
