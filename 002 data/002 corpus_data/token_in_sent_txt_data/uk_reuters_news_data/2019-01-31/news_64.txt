british car industry warns against no-deal brexit as investment slumps
london reuters investment in the british car industry halved last year due largely to uncertainty about future trade with the eu and surveys showed consumers and businesses were more anxious about the economic outlook as britain heads towards a brexit
the society of motor manufacturers and traders said on thursday that investment in britain s automotive sector was million pounds last year nearly percent less than in and the lowest since the financial crisis
investment has effectively stalled said smmt chief executive mike hawes who called on the government to avoid the permanent devastation of a exit by britain from the european union
a lot of that is on hold because until you see what the future is do you have the confidence to invest in that plant when there is that sort of uncertainty production also fell by percent
the smmt said it expected car production to fall another percent in assuming an orderly brexit with a transition period to minimise economic disruption

britain is due to leave the eu the world s biggest trading bloc on march
its lawmakers have rejected the withdrawal agreement prime minister theresa may negotiated with brussels leaving the country on course for an abrupt exit that could cause major disruptions to trade
as may headed back to brussels on thursday to demand changes to her divorce deal leading eu lawmaker danuta hubner warned that the risk of a brexit had grown
hubner told reuters the bloc could offer britain more assurances over the backstop aimed at preventing a hard border in ireland in a political declaration on ties if london moves towards staying in a customs union with the eu
may wants to replace the emergency irish border fix with unspecified alternative arrangements something the eu says is vague and not enough of a guarantee
if there is no openness on the uk side to include those assurances in the political declaration on the future ties the process could mechanically take us to hubner said
other data on thursday showed confidence among british consumers held at a year low in january
increasing gloom about the outlook for the next months was offset by a small improvement in personal finances the gfk index showed
surveys of businesses by the confederation of british industry and lloyds bank also gave a sobering outlook for the world s economy
house prices a key barometer of consumer confidence in britain rose by just percent in annual terms in january their weakest rise in nearly six years
britain s housing market has slowed since the brexit referendum in june when nationwide estimated house prices were rising by around percent a year
but warnings by former finance minister george osborne that a leave vote would hit the value of people s homes by up to percent have not materialised
that has led many advocates of brexit to dismiss as a continued project fear current warnings that a scenario could cause severe disruptions to food and medical supplies transportation and manufacturing
but the smmt s hawes pinned the fall in automotive industry investment firmly on the uncertainties surrounding brexit
i think the numbers give the lie to that accusation investment figures production figures said hawes
if it s project fear then we re doing a good impression of it being a additional reporting by david milliken and william schomberg editing by guy faulconbridge and catherine evans
