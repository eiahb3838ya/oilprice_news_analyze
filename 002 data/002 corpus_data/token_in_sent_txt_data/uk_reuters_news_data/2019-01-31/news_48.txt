exclusive-u.n. may push back libya election conference
libya reuters the united nations is likely to delay a conference intended to prepare libya for elections this year until there is more support from rival leaders sources familiar with the plans said
the national meeting is central to a and western roadmap for a vote in libya as a way out of its war since the fall of muammar gaddafi
but big players and their allied armed groups wield considerable power under the status quo and there is mistrust between rival governments and parliaments
libya splintered following the revolt against gaddafi and has since been divided between competing political and armed groups based in tripoli and the east
more delay in the conference where libyans from all walks of society are supposed to decide details of their elections such as the presidential or parliamentary system would also probably push back an actual vote
under a french plan libya was meant to hold elections last but that was shelved due to divisions among rival leaders and a spike in violence in the capital tripoli
in a new push libya envoy ghassan salame wanted a conference in the first weeks of with potential polls by june
but momentum for that has been lost due to resistance from major parties backing the parallel governments in tripoli and the east who benefit from access to oil revenues and jobs for armed groups in the absence of police
power play sources familiar with the plans told reuters the conference could still happen by the end of february but a delay until at least march looked more likely
salame won t announce a venue and date ahead until he thinks there is enough support from all sides one source said
the mission in libya said it was seeking a successful meeting but no date was set yet
we plan for the conference to happen as soon as possible it said in a statement to reuters
diplomats say the conference is a last joker in the pack for salame who has toiled since september for elections
western nations hope ordinary libyans will pressure armed groups into a peaceful solution but in eastern libya some worry the forum may give a platform to islamists and other opponents defeated by the libyan national army lna of khalifa haftar
some lawmakers in the parliament last week proposed to ban the muslim brotherhood
that would make it difficult to talk to khaled mishri head of a rival parliament in tripoli who is close to the brotherhood
i personally think the conference is a good idea but it will be hard to achieve results said eastern lawmaker hamd bazaq
diplomats fear a recent spat between salame and the lna might further complicate preparing the conference
