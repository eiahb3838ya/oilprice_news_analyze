poll-oil faces uphill struggle as shale, growth risks challenge opec cuts
bengaluru reuters oil prices will struggle to gain much upward traction this year as concern about the global economy and growth in crude supply could offset a boost from opec production cuts and sanctions on iran and venezuela a reuters poll showed
the low for longer view is deferred but not repealed julius baer analyst carsten menke said
the survey of economists and analysts forecast brent crude oil futures to average a barrel in down from the projected in the previous monthly poll
this is the third consecutive month in which analysts have cut their oil price forecasts
oil demand will underperform averages in as major consuming economies face a slowdown and serious downside risks not least of which is the trade dispute edward bell of emirates nbd bank said
despite opec cuts supply growth will still be positive and contribute to an overall market surplus and stockbuilds in the price of brent marked its first annual decline in three years in and has averaged about a barrel so far this year under pressure mainly from concerns about a global economic slowdown exacerbated by the trade war between the united states and china and booming output

an group of leading producers meets on april in vienna to review their supply cuts which were agreed in december in an effort to drain global stockpiles
the potential loss in supply will however offer only limited support to prices analysts said
there still remains a fair deal of hesitancy in going long the oil market in the short term due to the uncertain economic outlook largely tied to the outcome of trade talks said harry tchilinguirian strategist at bnp paribas
global oil demand is seen growing by between and million barrels per day bpd in mostly in line with the international energy agency s million bpd forecast but it will largely depend on the economy analysts said
most of the demand growth will come from china and the rest of asia
but with slowing economic growth the dynamics from the emerging markets will be much lower than last year said frank schallenberger head of commodity research at lbbw
on the supply side while production growth could slow this year it should be large enough to limit any price gains

shale producers remain a key impediment to exponential gains in oil prices
swing producers will capitalise with incremental output should oil prices rise sharply from cuts said benjamin lu commodities analyst at phillip futures
