corpus christi texas jan reuters citgo petroleum corp the eighth largest refiner and venezuela s top foreign asset is in the middle of a as the trump administration tries to use the company as leverage to topple venezuelan president nicolas maduro
following the decision to impose sanctions on venezuela s oil industry this week both sides have engaged in aggressive moves for control of citgo which has roots in the united states dating back years but has been owned by venezuela s petroleos de venezuela or pvdsa for three decades
washington along with numerous nations in the western hemisphere has recognized opposition leader juan guaido as venezuela s president amid an economic crisis that has caused millions of people to flee the country
maduro was last year in a contest widely seen as fraudulent
as guaido this week worked with washington to wrest control of the company venezuela responded by ordering dozens of citgo s expatriate staff in the united states to return to caracas by the end of february people familiar with the matter said
earlier in the week citgo sent a team of executives to washington amid efforts by guaido and the government to appoint a new board of directors for citgo the people said
pdvsa also has said it would pursue legal efforts to block a citgo takeover
white house national security adviser john bolton on wednesday tweeted photos confirming the meeting with citgo executives
the united states is continuing to work to make sure that the economic benefits of venezuela s resources are not pilfered by maduro and his cronies he wrote
the company which operates three refineries and distributes fuel to more than gasoline stations across states recognizable by a red triangle logo has become the largest potential casualty from sanctions on venezuela
the trump administration ordered citgo profits to be retained to pressure maduro to step down
it also barred customers from transferring payment to pdvsa depriving the nation its largest source of cash
citgo imports crude from pdvsa in exchange for refined products which raises the possibility that citgo would be without a third of its crude supplies after a grace period ends
employees at the firms refineries say they have been advised by managers to ignore the furor
but the pressure is now threatening citgo operations from its capacity and plant management to debt refinancing and commercial relationships according to the people close to the matter
venezuelan expats whose numbers have increased in recent years hold key jobs at the company from running its finance operations to overseeing refineries
citgo did not respond to a request for comment on the executives discussions with officials or oil supplies for its refineries
the seriousness of the situation was underscored by the hurried exchanges among houston washington and caracas and the recall notice to expats

chavez works from the bahamas because he does not have a visa
the company has accumulated cash and credit lines in recent months as dividends payments to caracas have been blocked by sanctions imposed in
stephen goltz an analyst at s p global ratings projected citgo would generate about million in total cash from operations for the months ending june saying it was performing that may allow it to continue to source the crude oil it needs to refine into gasoline and other fuels to meet demand
citgo s three refineries can process a combined barrels of oil a day or about percent of total refining capacity
however citgo has been struggling to refinance a revolving line of credit a task that must be completed by july according to people close to the matter
pdvsa also faces a million interest bond payment in april though the sanctions could prevent a foreclosure sale of citgo shares in event of a default said mark weidemaier a professor at the university of north carolina school of law
guaido the head of venezuela s congress and president has asked the united states to protect citgo from creditors in event of a default while moving fast to appoint a new board loyal to his government
at least three former executives turned him down the people said
discussions are happening right now between venezuela s new government and the government on what to do with citgo said an adviser close to guaido and the government
the size of the task is huge starting with obstacles to appointing a new last week citgo idled the smaller of two units at its corpus christi refinery in texas
