u.s. secretly ships cold war-era plutonium to nevada
washington reuters the government secretly shipped a large amount of deadly plutonium from a south carolina site that produced the radioactive metal for nuclear bombs during the cold war to nevada the trump administration revealed on wednesday
the justice department on behalf of the department of energy s national nuclear security administration said in a notice filed with a court in nevada that it could reveal the shipment of half a metric ton pounds because sufficient time had elapsed after the transfer to protect national security
the shipment occurred before november
the court in nevada has been considering an effort by the state of nevada to stop planned shipments of a metric ton of plutonium from south carolina that the energy department announced last august
the plutonium was shipped from the at the savannah river site the oldest reactor at the facility to the device assembly facility at the nevada nuclear security site about miles km north of las vegas
the revelation angered politicians from nevada a sparsely populated state where the federal government has long wanted to store nuclear waste

senator jack rosen a democrat said the nnsa misled a federal court in a deceitful and unethical move jeopardizing the health and safety of thousands of nevadans and americans who live in close proximity to shipment she said she and other state politicians were prepared to take action against the nnsa
representative dina titus another nevada democrat said the shipments would bolster opposition to the storage of spent fuel from nuclear power plant in nevada s yucca mountain a project on which billions of dollars has been spent that was closed by former president barack obama
the nnsa said that due to security reasons no public notice was given ahead of the shipment and the highway route was not revealed
the department did not reveal when the shipment was made other than it occurred before november before nevada had sued to stop the proposed shipments
the united states built the savannah river site during the to produce basic materials for nuclear weapons mostly tritium and
in october the trump administration killed plans to convert tons of plutonium there into mixed oxide or mox fuel for a specialised nuclear power reactor that has never been built in the united states
like the obama administration before it the trump administration wants to dilute and bury that plutonium potentially in new mexico
