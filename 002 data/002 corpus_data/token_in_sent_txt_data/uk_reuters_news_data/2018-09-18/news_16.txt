china sets tariff on u.s. lng just as exports ramp up
sept reuters china has set a percent tariff on imports of liquefied natural gas just as trade of the fuel between the two nations started to ramp up and exports from new terminals on the gulf coast are poised to begin
beijing announced on tuesday it would tax thousands of products worth billion in retaliation for tariffs imposed by president donald trump as the trade war between them escalated
china became the world s importer of lng last year behind japan and ahead of south korea driven by a push to convert to cleaner gas from coal generation energy
at the same time the united states is poised to become a major exporter with the majority of lng supply growth in coming years from new terminals being planned or built now
china imported million tonnes of the million tonnes of lng that has been exported from the united states so far this year according to thomson reuters data
analysts and traders have said that although china is a huge buyer of lng especially in the to and during winter it should easily find supplies from other large exporters such as qatar and australia
qatargas said this month it had signed a deal to supply a unit of petrochina with million tonnes a year
for companies developing lng export terminals such as cheniere energy sempra and kinder morgan the tariff casts doubt over their projects final investment decisions fids which trigger construction of facilities
it s a problem for cheniere as it makes their lng uncompetitive in china noel tomnay vice president for gas and lng consulting at wood mackenzie told reuters on the sidelines of an industry event in barcelona spain
but the biggest problem is for all those lng projects trying to get fid
china would be the biggest market for all of them
while these tariffs last it s unlikely they can take off
that s a potential opportunity for projects
canada to go four new terminals and one extension will come onstream in stages over the next two years
once they run at capacity they will constitute percent of all new supplies expected to be added to the global market by
aside from that there are dozens of new trains or facilities planned at existing or new terminals which all need fids before they progress
