doping-wada should postpone ruling on rusada, say anti-doping leaders
sept reuters the world agency wada should postpone this week s decision on whether to reinstate russia s agency rusada leaders said on tuesday
national bodies from around the world including ones from the united states britain and australia said in a joint statement that wada should not reinstate rusada until russia can prove it has fulfilled the wada roadmap to code compliance
wada s executive committee is set to meet on thursday to review rusada s efforts towards reinstatement
rusada was suspended in november over a wada report outlining evidence of systematic doping in russian athletics
it has since undertaken broad reforms in a bid to revamp russia s system and restore international trust in the country s sport
according to the wada roadmap for the agency to regain accreditation russian authorities must acknowledge the findings of a report that found more than russian athletes benefited from a scheme to conceal positive tests over a period
russia has vehemently denied those allegations
the authorities must also provide access to urine samples stored at the suspended moscow laboratory
wada said last week that its compliance review committee had reviewed a letter from the russian sports ministry it said had sufficiently acknowledged the issues identified in russia thus fulfilling the first of two remaining criteria for its reinstatement
but the group of leaders which also includes austria canada finland germany ireland japan netherlands new zealand norway and poland said it was dismayed by what it called a compromise by wada s compliance review committee
we can not understand or accept that the simple fact that the two remaining conditions regarding russian acceptance of the mclaren report and access for wada to the moscow laboratory remain unfulfilled and yet wada s leading compliance body is recommending the reinstatement of a country that perpetrated the worst doping system ever seen in international sport the bodies said in a statement
the statement added we the international leaders wish to place on record that the goal posts have been moved
the roadmap has changed
this is quite simply unacceptable and will not restore confidence in global sport at a time when athletes and sports fans need it the group also said wada should postpone any decision until russia has clearly and publicly met the outstanding conditions of the roadmap to code compliance and until it is in possession of the data from the moscow lab
now is not the time for wada to on its roadmap the group said
it is not the time for wada to turn its back on the majority the clean athletes and sports reporting by frank pingue in toronto editing by toby davis
