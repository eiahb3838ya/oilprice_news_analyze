sweden's vattenfall struggles to recruit enough engineers, technicians
oslo sept reuters sweden s largest utility vattenfall said on tuesday it was struggling to find enough skilled staff to fill engineering and technical positions at power plants across sweden
vattenfall which employs around people is growing its operations while facing a wave of retirements and needs to recruit some employees to operate nuclear plants and other facilities
it s hard to find
this in a time when there is a major shortage of skilled labour in a competitive market
for this reason starting today vattenfall is carrying out a new recruitment campaign the company said in a statement
since sweden s overall rate of unemployment has fallen to percent from percent while the number of jobs that went unfilled almost doubled statistics sweden data showed
vattenfall is offering various positions for instance engineers project managers service technicians and project planners mainly for the nuclear power sector but also in distribution maintenance hydro power and wind power
the staff shortage was not affecting power production vattenfall s human resources chief dag svensson told reuters
we are recruiting to build long term in march vattenfall said it would cut jobs by in an effort to reduce costs mostly support positions unrelated to the recruitment drive for skilled technicians and engineers svensson said
