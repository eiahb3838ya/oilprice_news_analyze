update 2-china lng tariff casts shadow over new u.s. export terminals
chinese tariff set at pct lower than expected trump pushing to make a global energy leader china was world s lng importer last year adds comments by lng trade executives adds graphic updates share prices by scott disavino and sabina zawadzki new sept reuters china set a percent tariff on liquefied natural gas lng imports extending a trade dispute into energy and casting a shadow over export terminals that would propel the united states into the world s lng seller
beijing on tuesday said it would tax products worth billion effective in retaliation for tariffs imposed by president donald trump in an escalating trade war
the rate was smaller than the percent tariff china had touted earlier which offered some relief and helped shares in listed lng companies climb
the tariffs undermine trump s drive to use shale oil and natural gas to turn the united states into a global energy leader
the is on track to export over billion cubic feet bcf of gas as lng in
one billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about million homes for a day
but china which purchased about percent of all lng shipped in is now on track to buy less than bcf of lng in less than last year according to thomson reuters vessel tracking and department of energy data
the country has taken delivery from just four vessels since june versus during the first five months of the year
for a graphic on lng deliveries to china click here proposed export terminals many expected to supply chinese customers were expected to account for percent of all new lng production coming to market by according to industry data
lng which involves natural gas so it can be transported by ship rather than pipeline has become one of the fastest growing commodity trades as nations seek cleaner fuels
the tariff s extension to an energy commodity much in demand in china was a worrisome sign for trade relations and for billions of dollars in proposed terminals said trade group executives
including lng is a good indicator of how serious things have gotten between the and china on this trade issue said charlie riedl executive director of center for liquefied natural gas a group whose members include cheniere energy chevron and exxon mobil
while we would like to see this resolved quickly i don t see that happening right now said riedl speaking by phone from a natural gas conference in spain
the longer the dispute lasts the less likely proposed projects will find financial backers he said
analysts say the tariffs will particularly hit plans by companies such as cheniere energy sempra and kinder morgan to build new terminals or expand existing ones by adding processing units
some commercial agreements may be on hold until there is more visibility said stacey morris director of energy research at alerian indexes
cheniere kinder morgan and dominion energy declined to comment
but the chinese tariff helped lift cheniere energy whose shares on tuesday were up percent and golar lng whose stock rose percent
china imported million tonnes or percent of the million tonnes of lng exported from the united states so far this year according to thomson reuters data
that accounted for percent of total chinese lng imports
the has been looking to europe to take on more of its natural gas as the china dispute continues
germany said on tuesday the country would decide by where to locate a new lng receiving terminal as a gesture to the trump administration
