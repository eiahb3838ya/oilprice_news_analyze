global markets-shares hold ground as u.s. and china ramp up trade war
trump imposes pct tariffs on bln goods from china china says will retaliate but markets shrug china bluechip shares up percent as asia rallies european stocks futures nudge higher dollar flat in fx markets government bonds make ground graphic world fx rates in london sept reuters who s afraid of the big bad trade war
not world stock markets it seems
the response to president donald trump s decision to go ahead next week with collecting percent tariffs on another billion of chinese goods ratcheting up to percent in january was unusual and unexpected on tuesday
trump s measures initially hit stocks treasuries and the dollar while stirring a rally in chinese equities and the yuan
china then retaliated just before markets were due to open with billion worth of tariffs of its own but still traders barely flinched
european stocks wobbled slightly but wall street futures still pointed to a steady start and even copper and the aussie dollar which have been highly sensitive to the trade tensions made good ground
in a way it is remarkable that the market is holding up so well said rabobank s head of macro strategy elwin de groot
this is clearly a further ratcheting up of the trade war and we are now getting close to a situation where you can almost speak of a trade war
clearly that is not one theory for the becalmed reaction was that the billion move had been largely priced in to markets following weeks of hinting reports and social media speculation
chinese shares had initially dipped as asia digested the details but then rallied to close up percent as some locals bet on beijing stepping up infrastructure investment to keep the economy humming
japan s nikkei also ended percent higher and msci s emerging market index was up for the fourth day in the last five as percent gains in poland and russia added to asia s rebound
trump s announcement is largely consistent with the claims made earlier citi analysts said in a note estimating a basis point drag on china s economic growth from the percent tariff
taking a bigger picture view dutch bank ing estimated that percent of world trade was now affected by the tariffs and it will be percent if trump carries out threats to put levies on all of the s chinese imports
although this percentage may seem small the tariffs will disrupt supply chains and may therefore triple the effects on world trade ing also warned
stock exchange futures were all around percent higher with a rise in oil prices expected to lift oil majors and on relief that the tariffs on chinese goods had spared gadgets like smart watches
china s promise to respond to the moves also came as the south china morning post newspaper reported that beijing was reviewing plans to send a delegation headed by vice premier liu he to washington for trade talks
foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a daily news briefing later that the steps had brought new uncertainty to talks between the two countries
china has always emphasised that the only correct way to resolve the trade issue is via talks and consultations held on an equal sincere and mutually respectful basis
but at this time everything the united states does does not give the impression of sincerity or goodwill he added
not to be outdone trump later tweeted there will be great and fast economic retaliation against china if our farmers ranchers industrial workers are targeted despite all the noise the dollar currency index was broadly flat at although on an individual basis it rose against the japanese yen to just over and took percent off turkey s troubled lira
at the same time it was down slightly against the chinese yuan in offshore markets
the sensitive australian dollar also moved up percent to having also initially been hit when the tariff details broke
with fx participants wary that beijing authorities may quickly step in to markets at any point investors were spontaneously liquidating their short yuan positions said a trader at one chinese bank
china is likely to reject the invitation from the treasury for the new round of trade talk ocbc bank also said in a note on tuesday
oil prices had been down in asia and through most of the european morning session but then went on a tear as fresh signs emerged that opec doesn t plan to raise output to offset shrinking supplies from iran
international benchmark brent futures jumped over a dollar to per barrel while crude futures bounced up to just shy of a barrel
copper prices surged percent too and gold had also clawed itself into positive territory at having been struggling for most of the day
