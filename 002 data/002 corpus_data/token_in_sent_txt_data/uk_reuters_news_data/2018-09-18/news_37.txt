global markets-shares shrug as trump fires off tariffs on $200 billion of chinese goods
trump imposes pct tariffs on bln goods from china china says will retaliate but markets shrug china bluechip shares up percent as asia rallies european stocks futures go higher dollar flat in fx markets government bonds make ground graphic world fx rates in london sept reuters who s afraid of the big bad trade war
not world stock markets it seems
the response to president donald trump s decision to go ahead next week with collecting percent tariffs on another billion of chinese goods ratcheting up to percent in january was unusual and unexpected on tuesday
it initially hit stocks treasuries and the dollar while stirring a rally in chinese equities and the yuan in asia
china then confirmed it would retaliate but still traders barely flinched
european stocks gained over a third of one percent on course for a third day of gains wall street futures climbed and even copper and the aussie dollar which have been highly sensitive to the trade tensions in recent months held firm
in a way it is remarkable that the market is holding up so well said rabobank s head of macro strategy elwin de groot
this is clearly a further ratcheting up of the trade war and we are now getting close to a situation where you can almost speak of a trade war
clearly that is not one theory for the becalmed reaction was that the billion move had been largely priced in to markets following weeks of reports and social media speculation
chinese shares did dip initially as asia digested the details but then rallied to push the csi index up percent
some locals were betting that beijing will step up infrastructure investment to keep the economy humming
japan s nikkei also ended percent higher and msci s emerging market index was up for the fourth day in the last five as percent gains in poland and a percent rise in russia added to asia s rebound
trump s announcement is largely consistent with the claims made earlier citi analysts said in a note estimating a basis point drag on china s economic growth from the percent tariff
the trade war may get worse before it gets better
a trade war looms closer now they added however
china s promise to respond to the new tariffs also came as the south china morning post newspaper reported beijing was reviewing plans to send a delegation headed by vice premier liu he to washington for trade talks
in currencies the dollar was broadly flat at although on an individual basis it was a fraction firmer against the japanese yen at just shy of
at the same time it was down slightly against the chinese yuan in offshore markets
the sensitive australian dollar also moved up percent to having also initially been hit when the tariff details broke
with fx participants wary that beijing authorities may quickly step in to markets at any point investors were spontaneously liquidating their short yuan positions said a trader at one chinese bank
china is likely to reject the invitation from the treasury for the new round of trade talk ocbc bank also said in a note on tuesday
oil prices fell on worries rising trade tensions could dent global demand for crude
crude futures fell cents to a barrel while international benchmark brent futures lost cents to per barrel
gold was weaker too with spot prices down percent at an ounce
