polish miner pgg plans new mine as u.n. seeks end to coal era
pgg ceo says concerned about planet sees need to change poland not ready to end coal use until has alternative transition plan includes supplying services gasification by anna koper and barbara lewis katowice poland dec reuters polish pgg the european union s biggest producer of thermal coal said it plans to sink a new mine near where talks to wean the world off fossil fuels are taking place
the imielin north project around kilometres from katowice would cost at least billion zloty million with up to half the funding provided by pgg its chief executives tomasz rogala told reuters
poland s president said this week he would not allow anyone to murder coal outraging many of the thousands of delegates representing nearly countries at the conference
rogala expects the new mine to be completed in around five years time and have a reserve base of million tonnes
that compares with pgg s annual output of around million tonnes
while coking coal is on the eu list of strategic minerals because of its use in steel coal for power generation is more difficult to justify
rogala said he understands the need to move on from coal but alternative sources must be in place first
i have pressure to find new business he said adding that when effective electricity storage was developed coal generation would be obsolete
battery storage is a holy grail for those who favour green energy as it would make wind and solar power as reliable as coal nuclear and gas
it battery storage can change everything
the first effective electricity storage will end coal generation rogala said
we have to stop climate change
but i don t agree that european coal is responsible alone as the greatest use of coal is elsewhere he added
poland s coal output has shrunk by million tonnes over the last years rogala said while global production has at least doubled and electricity demand has kept rising
for now rogala said poland needs the fuel because it does not have nuclear generation and it does not want to depend on imports from russia which have been rising
pgg has a transition plan which includes supplying its technical services such as precision welding to other polish industries and producing gas from coal for energy and as a feedstock for the chemical industry
rogala said the aim is a transition that will create jobs with salaries equivalent to coal which in silesia are around percent better paid than the average
