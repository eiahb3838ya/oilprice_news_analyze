air fares in sudan soar due to local currency's devaluation
khartoum dec reuters air fares in sudan skyrocketed this week after aviation authorities ordered airlines to price tickets in line with a new exchange rate mechanism that sharply devalued the local currency
under the exchange regime introduced in october in a bid to tackle an acute shortage of foreign currency the sudanese pound was devalued to per dollar from pounds per dollar previously
that has led to a surge in the cost of many goods and services but air ticket prices had been set according to the customs exchange rate pounds per dollar until wednesday when the country s civil aviation authority announced the hike in a memo sent to airlines
the order caused prices to jump about percent according to travel agencies estimates
prices in dollars were not affected but only foreigners and sudanese residents of other countries may buy tickets in dollars
this decision has led to a drastic percent drop in travel in the last two days
this situation puts the aviation industry in sudan and travel agencies at risk of unbearable losses said mahjoub almack head of the sudanese association of travel and tourism agents
despite october s devaluation the pound remains under pressure and the gap between the official and black market rates has continued to widen
a dollar cost pounds on the black market on saturday
