update 4-german carmakers have 50:50 chance of facing detroit's fate, vw says
frankfurt reuters german carmakers only have a percent chance of surviving as leading players in the auto industry unless they transform their businesses to meet new regulations and adapt supply chains volkswagen s chief executive said on tuesday
car manufacturers have complained about new regulations including bans on older diesel vehicles in german cities and broader eu measures to cut car emissions saying they will hurt europe s car industry and cost jobs
if you look at the former bastions of the auto industry like detroit or turin you understand what happens to cities when corporations and leading industries falter ceo herbert diess told an auto suppliers conference in wolfsburg vw s manufacturing base
germany s auto industry association vda has said a ban on combustion vehicles in would threaten more than german industrial jobs of which are at car companies and their suppliers
tougher rules could push some carmakers out of business due to the pace of reforms required to shift production to electric cars and to tackle new geopolitical threats said diess
from today s point of view the chances are perhaps that the german auto industry will still belong among the global elite in years time he said referring to leading players volkswagen group bmw and daimler
european union lawmakers have agreed to seek a percent cut in car emissions by a higher level than germany had sought after a report called for dramatic steps to slow global warming
germany s bmw audi and mercedes brands command around a percent market share in the premium auto segment but a push to cut emissions hurts high horsepower vehicles and therefore german brands in particular
volkswagen is already struggling to overcome its emissions cheating scandal
its premium unit audi was fined million euros million on tuesday for emissions violations
we are all used to the fact that we have flourishing industrial metropolises around the central manufacturing plants of german carmakers and their suppliers places where people like to live and work but that s not guaranteed for eternity diess said
to cut average fleet emissions of carbon dioxide in europe by percent by volkswagen needs to raise its share of fully electric vehicles to percent of new car sales or to half in the event of a percent cut diess said
the push to cut vehicle carbon dioxide emissions the main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming is costly and would ultimately lead to a rise in pollution in germany given the country s dependence on generating electricity from brown coal he said
the shift from combustion engines to electric cars would also cost jobs at vw by diess said requiring an overhaul of the carmaker s components business
it is clear to us all that the structural shift will lead to fewer auto industry jobs in germany
the question is how quickly do we need to implement this structural change he said
jobs will disappear because it takes less time to build an electric car than a conventional one and because jobs will shift overseas to makers of batteries
a combustion car has components in its motor exhaust system and transmission
an electric car s battery and motor has only components according to analysts at ing
in europe there are about plants making combustion engines employing people
the largest engine plant in europe is volkswagen s factory in kassel
so far german carmakers have sourced battery cells from asian suppliers like lg chem and samsung sdi which are currently supplying audi and bmw
vw is overhauling its components division which eats up the lion s share of the billion euros billion spent on procurement develops and builds car parts at sites across the globe and employs about people
from onward volkswagen components will act as an economically independent entity diess said
each of the plants would be free to evaluate partnerships and even to build components for other carmakers diess said
