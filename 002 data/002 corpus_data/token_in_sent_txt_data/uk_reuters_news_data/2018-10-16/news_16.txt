update 2-japan refiner idemitsu finalises deal to buy out showa shell
tokyo reuters japanese oil refiner idemitsu kosan on tuesday finalised a deal to buy out showa shell sekiyu through a share swap in a deal worth about billion
shares in the two companies which had run up strongly ahead of the integration initially fell sharply on details of the deal before closing down around percent in a firmer overall market
the new firm will target annual savings of around billion yen million in from the integration up by billion yen from a previous projection the two companies said
the latest announcement spurred feelings that the stock has run out of new material said a source at a japanese brokerage
the refiners announced in july they had finally reached a deal to merge in april next year after idemitsu s founding family dropped its opposition to the plan
idemitsu japan s oil refiner by sales has long been keen to merge its operations with showa shell in response to shrinking gasoline demand in the country
the combined firm would account for about percent of japan s domestic gasoline sales second only to jxtg holdings which controls about half the market
in a joint statement on tuesday the companies said idemitsu shares would be exchanged for each showa shell share
idemitsu will be the surviving entity with showa shell shares to be delisted march
based on the ratio and idemitsu s closing price on monday showa shell is valued at yen per share a slight discount to its yen close on monday
that puts the deal value at about billion yen billion for the nearly percent of showa shell that idemitsu does not already own
idemitsu shares fell as much as percent before ending down percent while showa shell shares fell as much as percent before closing down percent
idemtisu president shunichi kito who will serve as president of the combined firm ruled out combining the group s seven refineries in japan with total crude refining capacity of million barrels per day bpd as all were competitive with room for exports
the new firm has a higher ratio of residue cracking capability at its refineries than rivals he said
the group could raise the capacity of heavy oil processing units at idemitsu s chiba refinery in response to the international maritime organization s move to ban use of high sulfur fuel he added
