poll-china exporters worried about trade war, rising costs at home
guangzhou china reuters chinese exporters are mostly confident they can weather a trade war with the united states but worry about collateral damage it might cause throughout the global economy according to a reuters poll of participants at china s largest trade fair
representatives from firms involved in sectors ranging from industrial machinery to home appliances motorcycles and new energy vehicles were surveyed during the canton import and export fair on oct
just over percent said they were worried about the trade war in the first poll carried out by reuters since the united states imposed tariffs on billion worth of chinese goods late last month escalating the tariff war between the world s two largest economies
we wanted to expand this year into the united states but the trade war has really thrown a spanner in the works said heidi tan sales director at motoma power which makes batteries for mobile phones including iphones
phone batteries have been hit by tariffs and tan says customers are already looking to buy from other countries
it is only be a matter of time before factories in southeast asia will be able to make the same batteries she said
still firms surveyed remained broadly optimistic about foreign markets despite mounting challenges with only percent expecting orders to decline this year and just percent expecting declines in
when the fair which draws thousands of companies was last held in april a reuters poll found percent of respondents were concerned about escalating trade tensions and only percent had anticipated a trade war
in the latest survey more than percent expected the trade war to last at least another year though some said it depends on how long president donald trump remains in the white house
the question isn t how long the trade war will last said charles zhu of taizhou jieba cleaning products
the question is how long will trump be in power percent of respondents said the government should proactively engage in discussions to try to end the trade war
just three respondents thought china should retaliate by restricting competition
one massive advantage china has is our ability to work hard and endure hardship we thrive under competition said michael zhuo of yuyao ghost audio adding around two thirds of his customers are in the united states
i m not sure whether the has factored this into their just under half of the firms surveyed had no business in the united states
effect many exporters in sectors like solar power and machinery said their shipments to the united states were negligible partly as a result of previous punitive tariffs that forced them to look at markets elsewhere
but some exporters still expressed worries over how the trade war was undermining confidence globally
the trade war first of all hurts the chinese economy where we have customers and it could also affect the economies of the countries we do business with said todd cao of jiangsu spanl ltd which exports building materials
partly as a result of the trade conflict economists polled by reuters earlier this month predicted that china s growth be its weakest since the global financial crisis
and for many exporters surveyed the rising costs of doing business in china including growing costs of raw materials and high staff turnover were more worrying than the trade war
respondents also listed problems like the crackdown on lending and tightening environmental regulations
some exporters said customers in emerging market economies were suffering from a squeeze on dollars that made it harder for them to buy their products
orders from turkey south africa argentina iran syria and libya are all down said tory mak a sales manager at guangzhou hd electronics blaming weakening economic conditions in these countries and effects from the trade war
some firms not directly hurt by the new tariff regime were suffering the effects of other policy shifts including the imposition of sanctions on iran
firms in the textiles electric equipment and solar sectors all said that their business was suffering because they were no longer allowed to export to the middle eastern country
we ve not been hit by the tariffs but by the sanctions which have cut our trade with iran to zero said one sales manager who did not want to be named
