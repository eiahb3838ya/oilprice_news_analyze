update 3-volvo warns some vehicle engines may exceed emission limits
stockholm reuters sweden s volvo warned on tuesday that some of its truck and bus engines could be exceeding limits for nitrogen oxide emissions as an emissions control component it uses was degrading more quickly than expected sending its shares lower
the company which makes trucks construction equipment and buses said the largest volume of potentially affected engines had been sold in north america and europe its two largest markets and that costs to fix the problem could be material
the issue could become an added headache for volvo which has been working hard to protect profitability after a surge in demand in europe and north america caused supply chain bottlenecks inflating costs for raw materials and labour
several countries have in recent years set ambitious goals to cut carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions bringing carmakers and truckmakers under greater scrutiny
the car industry was rocked by the dieselgate emissions scandal after germany s volkswagen was forced to pay hefty fines after admitting to systematic emissions cheating
volkswagen which has pegged the financial toll at over billion is still dealing with the fallout of the scandal
there was no indication on tuesday that volvo had cheated or hidden any emissions related information from authorities
volvo said all products equipped with the component met emissions limits at delivery and that its probe so far indicated that the degradation was not affecting all vehicles and engines in the same way and to the same extent
the company had begun speaking to relevant authorities in europe and north america where emission regulations are strictest a spokesman said
an european commission spokeswoman said the body would contact the swedish authorities to gather more information while reuters was not immediately able to reach north american authorities outside of regular business hours
the problem was with a catalyst converter sourced from an external provider volvo investor relations director anders christensson said declining to name the provider or say whether volvo would terminate the relationship
in certain applications when the engine is not running hot enough you get condensation water in there and that causes this problem
you get a warning signal in the dashboard saying you re running above nitrogen oxide levels he explained
kepler cheuvreux analyst mats liss said the question was whether the whole catalyst needed to be replaced or just one component estimating the total cost for volvo would be at least a couple of thousands of crowns per truck instantly
the volvo spokesman said there were no plans yet to recall any vehicles and had not been asked by authorities to do so
volvo sold trucks in europe and north america last year and reported operating income of billion swedish crowns
the company s shares were down percent at pence on gmt making it easily the biggest lower on stockholm s bluechip index on tuesday
it is due to report results on friday
analysts also speculated that an external supplier could mean that the problem was widespread and hit german truck rivals volkswagen and daimler
volkswagen and daimler did not immediately return calls seeking comments
