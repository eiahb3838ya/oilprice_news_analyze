mexico's lopez obrador pushes big oil to hurry, but offers little
mexico city reuters at his first meeting with foreign oil majors mexico s leftist pushed the companies to prove themselves by quickly pumping oil from recent finds sources say but gave no sign of offering up new fields to reverse dwindling output
andres manuel lopez obrador repeated a promise to respect more than existing contracts awarded following a sweeping energy overhaul as long as a review by his team finds no corruption
and he added companies must show results three executives who attended the meeting said
for independent talos energy which is developing a big offshore discovery announced last year along with partners premier oil and sierra oil gas lopez obrador s message was clear quickly bring new streams of production online
we know we have to exceed expectations and we re trying to make sure we do that said talos energy ceo tim duncan one of the executives who attended the session
at the meeting the also criticized the constitutional reform for failing to stop an extended output slide
operators such as talos and italy s eni which also announced a major offshore find last year are on lopez obrador s watch list to pump oil quickly said carlos pascual a former ambassador to mexico who now helps run consultancy ihs markit s global energy business
the focus on increased barrels is going to create greater pressure for some companies he said
the oil and gas blocks awarded in bidding rounds over the past three years to companies including royal dutch shell and chevron will result in billion in new investment the outgoing government estimates
lopez obrador s pick to be the new oil minister rocio nahle did not respond to a request for comment about lopez obrador s presentation
at the meeting lopez obrador also explained he intends to put some idle drilling rigs belonging to a few mexican service firms to work for state giant pemex according to three executives who attended the meeting
the executives who asked not to be named to avoid any from the incoming government said they were surprised at the decision to talk up the service contracts for pemex instead of encouraging much bigger investments the oil companies are capable of making
a former senior executive with pemex said the plan could add at most barrels per day bpd to mexico s million bpd production in a year far short of the percent increase to million bpd he is targeting during his six year term
lopez obrador is a critic of the energy reform that brought major oil companies to mexico for the first time in more than years and has warned he will not offer up more areas for auction
oil companies still hope he will soften that position in order to meet his ambitious production goals
the veteran leftist politician adopted a diplomatic tone at the industry session said the company executives and his team even pledged to ease regulatory delays companies face
reality could force pragmatism said an oil executive who attended the meeting arguing it is highly unlikely mexico could meet lopez obrador s lofty output goal with government spending alone
as an indicator firms are closely watching whether oil auctions set for february by mexico s independent oil regulator will be canceled or postponed after lopez obrador takes office in december
if that happens along with the pledge to focus production plans on squeezing more out of pemex fields with local rigs outside investment could cool for years in mexico s oil patch home to shale plays and the country s potentially lucrative deepwater gulf of mexico according to the executives and sector analysts
the head of the oil regulator juan carlos zepeda has said pemex would need to dedicate billion each year to exploration and production activities to hit lopez obrador s output goal about double this year s budget
advisor rocio nahle lopez obrador s pick to be energy minister said last month pemex will be allocated about billion for exploration and drilling in without going into detail
the nearly two hour meeting between lopez obrador and oil company executives ended with a promise to maintain continuous dialogue going forward however there was no period and following the set speeches lopez obrador and his senior energy aides quickly departed
no new meetings have yet been scheduled
one attendee bluntly quipped afterwards he really doesn t like reporting by david alire garcia and marianna parraga editing by frank jack daniel
