graphic-rising oil turns up heat on vulnerable emerging economies
london reuters a rise in oil prices to highs is heaping pressure on big crude consumers such as turkey india indonesia and south africa that are already grappling with current account deficits weak currencies and rising inflation
emerging markets worldwide have been buffeted in recent months by the strong dollar climbing interest rates and slowing growth momentum with turkey and argentina descending into currency crises
meanwhile brent crude prices have risen above per barrel thanks largely to coordinated production cuts by some of the world s biggest oil exporters as well as impending sanctions on crude exporter iran that could wipe yet more supply off the market
some analysts now think benchmark prices could return to per barrel for the first time since
but for a number of importers such as india turkey or indonesia who all have seen their currencies tumble to record lows this year oil is already more expensive now at a barrel than it was back in when the price hit a record a barrel
graphic rising oil prices spell trouble for emerging markets said jim mcdonald chief investment strategist northern trust an asset management firm with trillion under management
look at the largest market cap countries every one of them is an oil importer said mcdonald
high oil prices are bad for them unless it is tied to growth being really good today what is driving oil prices higher is not a in growth it is a slowdown in supply and that s a bad trouble is especially on the cards for those economies hit by the of a sharp currency drop heavy reliance on energy imports and external funding flows
graphic while china india thailand turkey south africa and indonesia top the list of biggest emerging market oil importers thailand enjoys a solid current account surplus and china only edged into a rare deficit in the first half of the year
however turkey argentina india and indonesia find themselves high up on the list of countries featuring large current account deficits as a percentage of their gdp according to forecasts by the international monetary fund for
for many countries the pressure is rising crude imports with rising prices
china india indonesia thailand turkey and south africa imported percent more crude oil in july the last month for which complete data is available than they did in january
the average cost of their oil imports in their respective currencies however has risen by an average of nearly percent in that time
analysts are also closely watching how another oil shock might affect country s import cover and the adequacy of central banks foreign currency reserves
as oil prices rise that ratio will come under even more scrutiny
consumer spending power across many of these countries is also bound to suffer as unlike in many consumers do not have the same cushion of fuel subsidies and central banks have to ramp up rates to tackle inflation pressures and steady their currencies
graphic meanwhile the hit taken by emerging market economies is likely to be severe enough to slow down oil demand growth this year and next
all three major oil market forecasters the international energy agency the energy information administration and opec cut their estimates for oil demand growth this year and next in the past days
all three cited the financial pain visited upon emerging markets as the key catalyst
