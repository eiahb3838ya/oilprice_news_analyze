update 1-california utility puts users in the dark to dampen wildfire threat
reuters california s largest public utility cut off electric power to about customers to prevent wildfires such as those that erupted in the state s wine country last fall as high winds threatened to topple trees and power lines this week
with gusty winds and low humidity in the forecast this week pacific gas electric warned customers on sunday that their power would be cut
the company initially said the blackout would last until at least monday evening and some schools canceled classes in the six affected northern california counties
but by monday afternoon the company said it expected to restore power to percent of affected customers by midnight
this is the first time that we have proactively turned off the power due to fire threat conditions said melissa subbotin spokeswoman for the utility which is owned by pg e corp
the power outage which started on sunday came just days after california s department of forestry and fire protection found that last year s cascade fire in yuba county which burned nearly acres and killed four people was started by sagging power lines coming into contact during heavy one of the lines was owned by pg e
with pg e facing billion of dollars in potential payouts from lawsuits california lawmakers in september passed a bill that could help the utility avoid potentially crippling liabilities
two smaller california utilities san diego gas electric and southern california edison also announced power cuts to some communities because the seasonal santa ana winds blowing off the deserts of southeastern california presented an extreme danger
pg e s move prompted many customers to complain on twitter that the outage was spoiling food disabling traffic lights and keeping them from doing their jobs
due to the disruption to customers the power cutoff was a last resort measure as part of a program that includes a team monitoring weather and other conditions in several counties especially during wildfire season typically late summer and fall subbotin said
we take into consideration climate change here as the new normal she added
that has unfortunately increased the risk of customers were warned of the cutoff by telephone text message and email subbotin said
the konocti unified school district in lower lake california which includes students was one of four lake county districts that closed superintendent donna becnel said
i always hate to cancel school becnel said by telephone
but with the number of power outages and not knowing how long it was going to last there was no way to have classes without heat lights and the ability to provide food for reporting by peter szekely in new york additional reporting by suzannah gonzales in chicago editing by lisa shumaker richard chang and diane craft
