magellan jumps into race to build u.s. gulf coast oil export terminal
nov reuters magellan midstream partners lp on thursday became the latest company to join a crowded group looking to build an oil export terminal on the gulf coast designed to load supertankers
oil exports are expanding rapidly but volumes are constrained because the country s shores have limited capability to load giant vessels that can carry about million barrels of crude oil
numerous companies including private equity firm carlyle group and commodities merchant trafigura and other pipeline operators have already announced proposals in what is quickly becoming a crowded field of those looking to finance and break ground on a project
currently the united states unlike top exporters such as saudi arabia has limited capacity to fully load very large crude carriers or vlccs forcing companies to do transfers in deep waters which is costly and inefficient
magellan said it is considering a potential export terminal on harbor island in corpus christi texas capable of loading vlccs
earlier this week carlyle said it was looking to build in partnership with the port of corpus christi which would need substantial dredging to deepen its waterways
other texas and louisiana projects have been proposed by companies including trafigura ag and pipeline operators enterprise products partners lp and tallgrass energy lp
to be sure magellan warned that it would take considerable time before a final decision on the project is made
it s very competitive we ve got significant interest to date but we ll see how it plays out said chief executive michael mears
crude production hit a record million bpd in august and exports surged to as much as million bpd in june
magellan also said the total cost of its proposed crude oil pipeline from the permian basin in west texas to the gulf coast is expected to be about billion with magellan s share being about million
permian production has outpaced pipeline capacity prompting several new lines to be announced
separately magellan said volumes on the bridgetex pipeline which moves crude from midland and colorado city texas to east houston averaged over bpd during the third quarter compared with about bpd a year earlier
