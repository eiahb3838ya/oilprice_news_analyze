mexico's pemex likely to launch mcdermott offshore platform in april
mexico city nov reuters mexico s pemex is expected to start operating in april the largest offshore oil platform built in the country in a decade which was constructed by mcdermott international an executive of the engineering firm said on thursday
pemex is trying to reverse a crude output decline by boosting its offshore operations especially in shallow waters along the southern gulf of mexico
pemex has long been focused on the area which is expected to see more activity from private producers that have won development rights there since
the new platform will replace a similar one that was damaged by a large fire in that killed three workers
mcdermott is vertically integrated
we were in charge of engineering here in mexico purchases construction transportation and installation
we will deliver the platform ready for operation alfredo carvallo director of mcdermott s mexico unit told reuters in a interview
the platform required an investment of million mexican engineers direct workers and over two years to be completed carvallo added
the facility can handle up to barrels per day bpd of crude output and million cubic feet per day of natural gas
it is expected to serve pemex s most prolific oilfields including located in the campeche bay
the platform built near the port of altamira in northeastern tamaulipas state is the first one fully assembled in mexico
transportation to its final location is expected to be completed in november followed by installation and testing in the following months
mcdermott has built platforms in the last decade for pemex and is working on two additional infrastructure projects for the firm
the company has been using its altamira hub to build platforms for oil companies across the americas including trinidad tobago in the caribbean
mcdermott earlier this week said it was awarded a contract by brazil s petrobras to design and build a pipeline associated with a gas export system in the santos basin s area
mcdermott also announced it plans to divest its global storage tank business and pipeline construction in the united states which had combined revenues of about billion last year
pemex s crude output slightly increased to million bpd in september but its accumulated annual average of million bpd is percent below last year s production the company said on thursday
