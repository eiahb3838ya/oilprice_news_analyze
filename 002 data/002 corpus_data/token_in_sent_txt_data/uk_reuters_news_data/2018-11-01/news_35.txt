corrected-reuters summit-deutsche boerse launches eex asia in singapore to grow in asian commodity markets
the story corrects name of otc platform in paragraph from cleartrade to cleartech
by henning gloystein and jessica jaganathan singapore reuters german exchange group deutsche boerse is revamping its asian business with the launch of its european energy exchange eex in singapore looking to boost its business in the world s fastest growing commodity markets
deutsche boerse which has global ambitions for eex said it would rebrand its subsidiary cleartrade exchange cltx as eex asia offering futures contracts on freight and seaborne commodities such as fuel oil and iron eex is europe s biggest bourse for trading power and also a leading exchange for natural gas coal and carbon trading
we have the ambition to become a global commodities exchange said egbert laege eex group board member and its head of global commodities
in eex group bought cltx which deals in commodities like iron ore and fuel oil to get a foothold in asia which is by far the world s biggest and fastest growing commodity and energy market
last year eex bought power and natural gas bourse nodal exchange
the acquisition of cltx was the first step
then last year nodal was the next step laege told the reuters global commodities summit series of interviews that takes place this week
eex group will also operate cleartech out of singapore as a platform handling support for commodities traded outside exchanges known as otc markets
eex asia will initially focus on expanding its freight offerings
it s the freight market we find most interesting especially in asia
it s a key facilitator for global trade and there s a huge overlap of asian and european freight clients he said speaking to reuters while attending the singapore international energy week siew
the next step will be iron growing its business will put eex asia in competition with the dominant bourse in this field the baltic exchange which was bought by singapore exchange sgx in
in some of our offerings we will be competing with sgx s offerings for sure said laege
in europe eex started off as an electricity exchange before branching out into the main fossil fuels that fire power stations thermal coal and natural gas
while it has established some links in asia including early product design projects with the japan electric power exchange jepx laege said electricity was not a priority for eex asia at this stage
as an exchange you can not a market
there needs to be a threshold market size and liquidity first and in asia s power and gas markets we re not quite there this was also the case for the booming liquefied natural gas lng market
while it is true that lng demand is growing you have a lack of standardized delivery contracts laege said with higher standardization a prerequisite for an lng exchange product
despite some attempts to chance the status quo it will have to be seen whether you ll ever have such standardization in asian lng as you have in and european natural gas markets he added
