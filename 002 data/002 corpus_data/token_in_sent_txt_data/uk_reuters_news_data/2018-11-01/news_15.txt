update 2-trump increases pressure on venezuela with sanctions on gold
washington reuters president donald trump increased economic pressure on venezuela s leftist president nicolas maduro on thursday with new sanctions aimed at disrupting the south american country s gold exports
trump signed an executive order to ban anyone in the united states from dealing with entities and people involved with corrupt or deceptive gold sales from venezuela trump s national security adviser john bolton said in a speech in miami
the maduro regime has used this sector as a bastion to finance illicit activities to fill its coffers and to support criminal groups bolton said
bolton made the announcement as part of a pledge to crack down on what he called the troika of tyranny in the western hemisphere naming cuba venezuela and nicaragua
miami is home to large numbers of immigrants from cuba and venezuela
bolton made his appearance there just days before congressional elections that include close races for a senate seat and the governorship in florida
bolton s remarks were likely to be well received by those and other hispanics in florida who favor stronger pressure on cuba s communist government and other leftist governments in latin america
bolton spoke at freedom tower a building where cuban refugees were welcomed in the following fidel castro s revolution a day after trump campaigned in florida for republican candidates
florida has traditionally been a swing state and former president barack obama was scheduled to rally democrats in miami on friday ahead of the elections
bolton said cuba is aiding maduro s government in venezuela referring to the close ties between the two countries since maduro s predecessor hugo chavez came to power in
trump has taken a harder line on cuba after obama sought to set aside decades of hostility between washington and havana
he has rolled back parts of obama s detente by tightening rules on americans traveling to the caribbean island and restricting companies from doing business there
bolton said the state department would within days add more than two dozen entities to a list of cuban organizations associated with country s military and intelligence services
persons and companies are banned from doing business with the restricted companies
he said the administration would review whether to allow citizens whose property was seized by the castro government to sue foreign companies that have invested in the properties in cuba
the review requested by a group of republican lawmakers from south florida was first reported by mcclatchy
we want to look at this question with a fresh set of eyes bolton said
bolton also singled out nicaragua for criticism over leftist president daniel ortega s crackdown on political opponents saying its government will feel the full weight of america s robust sanctions regime with measures coming in the very near almost million venezuelans have fled since driven out by food and medicine shortages hyperinflation and violent crime
thousands have made their way to south florida
maduro who denies limiting political freedoms has said he is the victim of an economic war led by the united states
venezuela this year turned to gold as a way to receive hard currency exporting tonnes of gold worth million to turkey in the first nine months of the year compared with zero in the same period last year official turkish data showed
in maduro declared war on illegal miners and declared gold a strategic priority in an effort to spur production in the mining arc to create an alternative source of revenue for the economy
critics and opposition leaders say this decision has in fact led to a surge in wildcat mining and violence with the government reaping the benefits of illegal gold production
the country s gold revenues remain small compared to the opec member s oil sector which accounts for over percent of export revenue
the trump administration had threatened sanctions on venezuela s oil industry but a senior official said this month there is less need to target the energy sector given that it is unraveling under military officials
analysts say higher oil prices and a desire to protect gulf coast refiners have also weighed on washington s decision
early in his presidency trump briefly spoke about a possible military option for venezuela without providing details
bolton brushed off a question about whether trump would consider interventions other than sanctions
i don t see that happening in part because i am very firmly of the view that as the sanctions torque up the pressure will become unbearable bolton said
