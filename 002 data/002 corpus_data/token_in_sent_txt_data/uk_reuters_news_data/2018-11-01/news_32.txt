uae's enoc to shut condensate splitter for a month in nov -sources
singapore nov reuters emirates national oil company enoc has scheduled maintenance for november at its barrels per day bpd condensate splitter in the united arab emirates uae industry sources said on thursday
the planned maintenance will include the integration of a new crude distillation unit cdu pipeline that is expected to come onstream late next year the sources said
the sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media
enoc did not immediately reply to an email from reuters on the matter
the maintenance comes as companies including enoc and south korea s hanwha total are grappling with feedstock condensate supply tightness due to sanctions against iran which will take effect this month
enoc had chartered at least one vessel to store jet fuel to ensure supply to airlines in dubai sources told reuters last month
it also has onshore tanks to store refined oil products including gasoline and feedstock
separately enoc last month announced that it would be constructing a jet fuel pipeline that can carry cubic metres of the aviation fuel per hour to al maktoum international airport
the jet fuel pipeline is expected to be operational in the first quarter of it said on its website here reporting by seng li peng and jessica jaganathan editing by joseph radford
