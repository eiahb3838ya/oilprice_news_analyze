trump signs sanctions order targeting venezuela's gold exports-bolton
washington nov reuters washington ratcheted up pressure on venezuela s leftist president nicolas maduro on thursday with new measures aimed at disrupting the south american country s gold exports national security adviser john bolton said
bolton promised a tough stance by the trump administration toward dictators and despots near our shores and singled out venezuela cuba and nicaragua in a speech in miami which is home to large numbers of migrants from cuba and venezuela
he spoke days before elections next week that include close races for a senate seat and the governorship in florida
his remarks were likely to be well received by those and other hispanics in florida who favor stronger pressure on cuba s communist government and other leftist governments in latin america
in his prepared remarks for the speech bolton said president donald trump had signed an executive order to ban persons from dealing with entities and individuals involved with corrupt or deceptive gold sales from venezuela
many of you in the audience today have personally suffered unspeakable horrors at the hands of the regimes in cuba venezuela and nicaragua only to survive fight back conquer and overcome bolton said in his prepared remarks
the troika of tyranny in this hemisphere cuba venezuela and nicaragua has finally met its match he said
bolton spoke at freedom tower a building where cuban refugees were welcomed in the following fidel castro s revolution a day after trump campaigned in florida for republican candidates in tight senate and gubernatorial races
florida has traditionally been a swing state and former president barack obama was scheduled to rally democrats in miami on friday ahead of the elections
trump has taken a harder line on cuba after obama sought to set aside decades of hostility between washington and havana
he has rolled back parts of obama s detente by tightening rules on americans traveling to the caribbean island and restricting companies from doing business there
on thursday the state department added more than two dozen entities to a list of cuban organizations associated with country s military and intelligence services bolton said in his prepared remarks
persons and companies are banned from doing business with the restricted companies
bolton said cuba is aiding maduro s government in venezuela referring to the close ties between the two countries since maduro s predecessor hugo chavez came to power in
almost million venezuelans have fled their country since driven out by food and medicine shortages hyperinflation and violent crime
thousands have made their way to south florida maduro who denies limiting political freedoms has said he is the victim of an economic war led by adversaries
venezuela exported tonnes of gold worth million to turkey in the first nine months of this year compared with zero in the same period last year official turkish data showed an illustration of how the south american country is shifting its pattern of trade following a wave of sanctions that began last year
bolton also singled out nicaragua for criticism over leftist president daniel ortega s crackdown on political opponents saying its government will feel the full weight of america s robust sanctions colombian president ivan duque and brazil s jair bolsonaro are likeminded leaders bolton said adding the united states would partner with them and leaders in mexico argentina and other latin american nations to boost security and the economy in the region
also on thursday the united nations general assembly overwhelmingly adopted its annual resolution calling for an end to the economic embargo on cuba after a failed attempt by washington to amend the text to push cuba to improve its human rights record
