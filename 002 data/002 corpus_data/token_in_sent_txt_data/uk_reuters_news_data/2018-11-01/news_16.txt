reuters summit-mercuria says oil near $70 is litmus test for producer strategy
london reuters the world s largest oil producers could reverse their strategy of raising output and revert to reduction mode if the price of crude holds near a barrel into next year mercuria chief executive marco dunand said on thursday
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec together with russia oman and others embarked on a strategy in of cutting output to drain a vast overhang of global oil inventories and prop up the price
if we start moving into the low on brent i think some of those producers will start asking themselves whether they haven t overreacted to the earlier price rally and start considering balances dunand told the reuters global commodities summit
they ve spent the past three years bringing inventories down to more historical levels
is there going to be enough cohesion among them to curtail production again the producers plan worked to the extent that the price of a barrel of oil rose to a peak around a barrel in early october from less than in while global inventories fell to opec s target
with the impending loss of anything up to million barrels per day bpd of iranian crude exports because of sanctions opec led by saudi arabia has pledged to raise output to prevent the gap between supply and demand from becoming too tight
sanctions come into force from
the price has slipped to around in recent weeks thanks largely to concerns over the impact to demand growth from an escalating trade dispute between the united states and china while inventories worldwide have begun to swell again
mercuria trades more than million bpd of oil and together with rivals vitol trafigura and gunvor ships billions of tonnes of commodities between the world s producers and consumers
because of trade tensions and a number of other factors such as a bit of exuberance on other fronts there is plenty of risk that demand growth will not be a strong as originally anticipated dunand said
if you put it all together the chances are that we are going to be building oil follow reuters summits on twitter for more summit stories see reporting by amanda cooper editing by david goodman
