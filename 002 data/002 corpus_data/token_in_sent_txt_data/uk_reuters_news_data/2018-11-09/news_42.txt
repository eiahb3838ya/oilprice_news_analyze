buyers to head to tehran next week for talks can import up to bpd for days adds detail graphics analyst comment changes slug by florence tan and jane chung nov reuters a south korean delegation including oil buyers is expected to head to iran next week to discuss resuming iranian oil imports after a halt three sources with knowledge of the matter said
south korea is one of eight countries that received waivers from the united states to continue importing iranian oil for days
it can import up to barrels per day bpd of iranian oil mostly condensate the sources said without invoking economic sanctions on iran on
the north asian country was the buyer of iranian oil and also the largest importer of its condensate before it stopped imports in september ahead of sanctions
south korea s condensate imports from iran stood at bpd in down about percent from bpd in the same period last year according to reuters calculations based on the korea national oil corp knoc data
condensate is an ultra light oil processed at splitters typically to produce naphtha for petrochemicals
while the waiver has given south korea the green light to resume iranian oil imports the sources said issues such as payment shipping and insurance needed to be worked out
the actual import volume will depend on next week s negotiations one of the sources said adding that the oil s price will be a key factor
the sanctions waivers have eased pressure on iran to further discount its oil against saudi arabia s
sk incheon petrochem a petrochemical unit of sk innovation hyundai chemical a unit of hyundai oilbank and hanwha total petrochemicals a joint venture between hanwha corp and france s total are regular buyers of iranian condensate
each of the three imported between million and million barrels of south pars condensate a month in the first half of the year the knoc data showed
having a waiver doesn t mean you have it in your pocket
you still have to work through the supply chain fereidun fesharaki chairman of energy consultancy fge said at the condensate and naphtha forum in singapore on thursday
south korea will be paying for iranian oil in korean won to escrow accounts handled by the industrial bank of korea ibk and woori bank according to a south korea s foreign ministry statement released early this week
officials from both banks said however that payments for iranian oil were still being reviewed and that no schedule for a resumption has been set
buyers are also likely to receive oil delivered by iran using tankers owned by the national iranian oil co
the united states has warned of potential accidents and costs involving iranian tankers that are not covered by international insurance
fge analyst den syahril estimates that iran has been holding about million barrels of south pars condensate in storage since august as demand fell
another major south pars buyer the emirates national oil company enoc has also stopped imports
south pars exports which averaged just above bpd in the first half of this year could fall below bpd in the next two years depending on demand from south korea and china fesharaki said
