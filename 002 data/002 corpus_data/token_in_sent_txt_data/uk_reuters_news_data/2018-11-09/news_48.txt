exclusive-russia clashes with western oil buyers over new deals as sanctions loom
moscow reuters russian energy majors are putting pressure on western oil buyers to use euros instead of dollars for payments and introducing penalty clauses in contracts as moscow seeks protection against possible new sanctions
seven industry sources told reuters that western oil majors and trading houses have clashed with russia s third and fourth biggest producers gazprom neft and surgutneftegaz over oil sales contract terms during unusually tough annual renegotiation in recent weeks
the development mirrors a similar between western buyers and russia s top oil producer rosneft
earlier this week trading sources told reuters that rosneft wants western oil buyers to pay penalties from if they fail to pay for supplies in the event that new sanctions disrupt sales
now sources have told reuters that surgutneftegaz and gazprom neft have also clashed with their buyers over penalties and the use of euros and other currencies to replace the dollar in contracts
it is part of the same trend the russian oil industry is working on mitigating new sanctions risks
the buyers in turn argue they can not carry those risks so we are trying to find compromises said one source with a western buyer involved in negotiations asking not to be named as the talks are confidential
russia has been under and eu sanctions since when it invaded ukraine s crimean peninsula
the sanctions have been repeatedly widened to include new companies and sectors making it tough for russian oil firms to borrow money abroad raise new capital or develop arctic and unconventional deposits
president vladimir putin s administration has been hoping for a thaw in relations with the united states since president donald trump came to power but washington has imposed new sanctions instead including on some of russia s richest people
russian businesses are preparing for a new wave of sanctions expected in the coming weeks
the firms are trying to diversify away from dollar payments and tapping asia for more of their financing and technology needs
according to four industry sources surgutneftegaz asked buyers to be prepared to switch from dollar to euro payments in contracts and insisted on buyers being effectively responsible for any losses arising from sanctions
they basically said sanctions don t matter
buyers have to find a way to pay or to return purchased goods or pay penalties a source with a big trading house said
gazprom neft has also asked buyers to use euros in payments and bear financial responsibility for contract breaches in the case of new sanctions according to three sources
gazprom neft refused to comment
surgutneftegaz did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment
russia supplies over percent of global oil so drastic sanctions against it could lead to a steep spike in oil prices
all global oil majors rely on russia to feed their refineries especially in europe and asia and hence they can not just walk away from annual contract negotiations if they are unhappy with terms
talks with both gazprom neft and surgutneftegaz have been progressing slowly and painfully according to trading sources
several western buyers have managed to agreed compromises with surgutneftegaz and gazprom neft but others are still in tough talks with the producers the sources said
all surgutneftegaz s contracts are bespoke and are negotiated individually in the siberian town of surgut by the firm s management and visiting western trading bosses
the sources declined to name companies that have already reached compromise deals
in one such compromise a large european buyer agreed to the use of euros in payments in exchange for surgutneftegaz dropping its demand for penalties from buyers who fail to pay for cargoes
we have been arguing that if sanctions make it impossible to pay for an oil cargo how on earth are we supposed to pay penalties one trading source said
so we have agreed that the payment remains suspended for the entire duration of sanctions just like it works with iran he added
