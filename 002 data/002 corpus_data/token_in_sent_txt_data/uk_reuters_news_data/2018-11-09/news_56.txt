rpt-column-u.s. government's borrowing binge poses global risks: kemp
repeats with no changes

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london nov reuters the government s finances are on an unsustainable trajectory and are likely to worsen further after the elections adding to the list of problems facing the global economy and oil markets in
the federal government s outlays exceeded its receipts by billion in fiscal year which ended on according to the congressional budget office monthly budget review cbo
the budget deficit would have been even worse at billion if certain outlays had not been brought forward and recorded in the previous financial year because the first day of fiscal fell on a weekend
even so the deficit increased to percent of gross domestic product up from percent the previous year and the highest since fiscal when the economy was still recovering from the global financial crisis
government receipts increased by just billion less than percent while outlays rose by billion around percent worsening the deficit by billion compared with the previous year
higher receipts from individual income taxes billion payroll taxes billion and customs duties billion were mostly offset by lower collections from corporate income taxes billion and fines billion
government outlays increased for net interest on the public debt billion social security billion defence billion medicare billion and medicaid billion
increased government spending especially on defence has helped fuel the acceleration in economic growth a big reason economy is accelerating government spending wall street journal
but the federal government s deteriorating financial position and increased borrowing needs are also driving up yields on treasury securities affecting borrowing costs across the entire economy and worldwide
yields on treasury notes have risen to more than percent more than double the recent low in and the highest since
tax cuts and increased spending at a relatively late point in the economic cycle have also encouraged the federal reserve to keep raising interest rates in order to hold inflationary pressure in check
the combination of fiscal stimulus and tightening monetary policy has caused the exchange rate to appreciate worsening the trade deficit as exporters and firms lose competitiveness to foreign rivals
in effect the economy is being by fiscal policy and the resulting imbalance is showing up in rising interest rates increasing borrowing costs an appreciating exchange rate and a widening trade deficit
government borrowing is likely to increase over the next two years making all these financial imbalances even worse and creating a major source of vulnerability in the global economy
the congressional budget office has forecast the budget deficit will worsen to around trillion around percent of gdp in both fiscal and fiscal the budget and economic outlook cbo april
in practice the government s financial position is likely to deteriorate even more than this as the president and congress compete for votes ahead of the next elections by seeking to extend tax cuts and raise spending
with congress divided between a house of representatives and a senate legislators are unlikely to agree on either spending cuts or tax increases to contain the deficit
instead lawmakers and the president are more likely to try to please their core supporters by agreeing to extend selected tax breaks and spending programmes in a bid to buy votes ahead of the next election in
president donald trump has already indicated he wants to work with congressional democrats on a big infrastructure bill saying on wednesday we have a lot of things in common on infrastructure
funding for major infrastructure programmes could come from the federal government state and local governments or private sources
federal government funding would hit the deficit directly
funding from state and local sources or the private sector perhaps with tax incentives would further stimulate an economy already operating close to full capacity
if the economy starts to slow in or the president and congressional leaders will push for even more tax cuts and higher spending to offset the slowdown
even more than other administrations the current white house has linked its credibility to the strength of the economy and a rising stock market so it will do everything possible to avert a recession between now and
the most likely scenario is that the fiscal position will continue to deteriorate in keeping upward pressure on interest rates borrowing costs the exchange rate and the trade deficit
this course is obviously unsustainable over the long run although it is not clear whether it can be kept going for at least two more years until after the next election
in the meantime the risk of sudden and disruptive changes in inflation interest rates asset prices or the exchange rate are a major source of risk to the global economy and oil consumption in
