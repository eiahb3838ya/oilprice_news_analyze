refile-update 1-butterfly effect: low eu river stirs fuel market 10,000 km away in singapore
singapore reuters low water levels on the rhine river have caused a fuel supply deficit in parts of europe s industrial heartlands that is sucking up cargoes from more than km away in singapore
following a long scorching summer water levels on the rhine a key commodity shipping lane connecting industrial centres in switzerland germany france and the netherlands to major seaports fell to record lows limiting the transport of coal steel grains and fuel
that has created a shortage of heating oil heading into the european winter pushing up the market and triggering a search for supplies from as far away as southeast asia where there is ample fuel and gasoil prices are low
northwest european prices for gasoil hit a record premium over singapore values for november fuel deliveries and december premiums are still above a tonne
that means gasoil could be pulled into europe from southeast asia via arbitrage trades through the end of the year
the wide arb means it s possible to shift gasoil to the west europe at a profit said sukrit vijayakar director of indian energy consultancy trifecta adding that the situation stemmed from the low rhine water levels and asian refineries coming out of turnarounds
the arbitrage to europe from asia is usually workable when the price spread is at least a tonne
many asian refineries have just come out of maintenance or turnarounds increasing the region s availability of fuels like gasoil
gasoil inventories held in the ara refining and storage hub fell for the fourth straight week to million tonnes the lowest volume since this year according to data from dutch consultancy pjk international
by refilling ara stocks with gasoil including from asia traders said they hope to be able to ship gasoil up the river as soon as water levels recover
some meteorologists expect low water levels to last until january however which may mean a continuation of the blockage and ongoing market distortions
as a result european traders may start exporting gasoil out of the region to offset arbitrage volumes into ara from asia
it is one thing to ship the distillates from singapore to europe
but it will not reach the as long as ship traffic is constrained due to low water levels of the rhine and other rivers said carsten fritsch a commodity analyst at germany s commerzbank
german retail gasoline and heating oil prices are very high as a result no visible improvement is in sight here in the near future according to german weather forecasts he said
europe typically starts to stockpile gasoil which is used for heating in the region ahead of the cold winter months
asian refiners though must act fast to serve the european demand window as american and also russian suppliers are also eying the opportunity
comparing asian refiners with their counterparts the latter stand a better chance to go to europe as freight rates are cheaper and the voyage time is very much shorter one trader in singapore said declining to be named as she was not allowed to talk in public about commercial operations
despite america s advantage over asia to supply europe ship tracking data in refinitiv eikon shows one tanker the diva carrying gasoil from southeast asia to europe
the tonne tanker is currently in the mediterranean and expected to arrive at antwerp on
if this arb window stays open i d expect more such routes to be fixed next week said a tanker charterer also declining to be named
