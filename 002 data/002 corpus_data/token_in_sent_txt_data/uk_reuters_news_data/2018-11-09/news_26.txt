u.s. judge halts keystone xl pipeline, dealing project another setback
by brendan o brien and david gaffen nov reuters a judge in montana late thursday halted construction of the keystone xl pipeline that would carry heavy crude oil from canada to the united states throwing another obstacle in the path of the project that has been in development for a decade
the ruling dealt a major setback to transcanada corp and could delay the construction of the billion mile km pipeline
it was also a blow to president donald trump who approved the line shortly after taking office in as part of his plan to boost energy infrastructure
a transcanada spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment
the ruling is a victory for environmentalists tribal groups and ranchers who have spent more than a decade fighting against construction of the pipeline that will carry heavy crude from alberta to steele city nebraska
from there it would connect to key refining points in the midwest and gulf coast as well as export terminals in the gulf
district court judge brian morris ruled late thursday that the government did not complete a full analysis of the environmental impact of the project
his ruling came after a lawsuit was filed by several environmental groups against the government in soon after trump announced a presidential permit for the project
morris wrote in his ruling that a state department environmental analysis fell short of a hard look at the cumulative effects of greenhouse gas emissions and the impact on native american land resources
state department officials were not immediately available for comment
in thursday s ruling morris ordered the government to issue a more thorough environmental analysis before the project could move forward
canada has long sought more arteries to move oil out of the province of alberta where the heavy bitumen is extracted
several projects have already been scrapped and the canadian government had to take ownership of another project an expansion of the trans mountain line to move it forward
but that project is facing delays in canada
it means more delay for transcanada said sandy fielden an analyst at morningstar
you have to wonder how long investors will tolerate the delays and whether the canadian government will intervene again to protect the the united states is the biggest importer of canadian crude but full pipelines have forced shippers to rely more heavily on less efficient transportation methods including railroad and in some cases trucks to deliver oil to pipeline injection points
the trump administration tried to force this dirty pipeline project on the american people but they can t ignore the threats it would pose to our clean water our climate and our communities said the sierra club one of the environmental groups involved in the lawsuit
morris said in his ruling the analysis failed to fully review the effects of the current oil price on the pipeline s viability and did not fully model potential oil spills and offer mitigations measures
former president barack obama rejected the pipeline in citing environmental concerns related to emissions that cause climate change
