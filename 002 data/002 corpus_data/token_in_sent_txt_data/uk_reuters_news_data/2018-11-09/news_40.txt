fukushima tests to help assess cooling of damaged reactors - tepco
tokyo reuters the owner of the fukushima nuclear plant destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami nearly eight years ago said on friday it planned tests early next year to see how much melted uranium fuel has cooled in the damaged reactors
the tests planned for january to march will stop water cooling in the reactors to analyze how the melted uranium core reacts and heats up after cooling has stopped said owner tokyo electric power all reactors need to be cooled to limit the radioactive reactions that produce heat to generate electricity
at fukushima tepco cooling systems after the quake and tsunami wrecked the plant in march
the natural disaster triggered meltdowns at three of the fukushima daiichi plant s six reactors spewing radiation into the air soil and ocean and forcing residents to flee many of whom have not returned
from january tepco will begin to gradually reduce the amount of water being pumped over the melted fuel in reactor no
at the site to half the amount over a week a company spokesman said
then tepco will resume full pumping but in march the company will stop all cooling for a period to test analytical models which have shown that the reactors will not overheat he said
tepco said it would use the test results to better understand radioactive reactions during an emergency cooling halt
it will also help manage other water issues at the site
tepco has for years struggled to control the amount of water in the basements of the damaged reactors
groundwater flowing from hills above the plant enters the reactors where it mixes with highly radioactive debris
the contaminated material is pumped out and treated before being stored in tanks that are quickly filling up
