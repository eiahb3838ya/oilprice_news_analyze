california-based appeals court has been thorn in trump's side
nov reuters a federal appeals court that has often ruled against president donald trump dealt him another setback this week in a major immigration case and soon could be asked to weigh in on a pipeline project he has championed
the
circuit court of appeals based in san francisco has been a thorn in trump s side since he took office last year and has drawn the republican president s ire for its decisions in cases
his latest setback before the circuit came on thursday when a panel rejected his bid to rescind a program launched by his democratic predecessor barack obama that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants brought into the country as children
the circuit has handed him defeats on his travel ban targeting people from several countries and his bid to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities that limit cooperation on immigration enforcement
it also is set to rule on the administration s appeal of a judge s order blocking trump s move to put restrictions on transgender people serving in the military
the circuit would hear any appeal by trump s administration of the ruling late on thursday by a federal judge in montana blocking construction for environmental reasons of the keystone xl pipeline project that is designed to carry heavy crude oil from canada to the united states
the justice department said on friday it is reviewing the keystone xl ruling to decide its next step
transcanada corp said it remains committed to building the billion pipeline
the circuit is an easy punching bag for trump because not only has it been traditionally liberal but california is its beating heart and we all know how trump fares in california said barry mcdonald a law professor at pepperdine university in malibu
he probably sees much of the west coast as a nemesis for california the most populous state is a liberal bastion that is unfriendly political territory for trump
the president regularly belittles the circuit as he did on friday after the court s ruling preserving the deferred action for childhood arrivals daca program
the daca will now hopefully go to the supreme court where it will be given a fair decision trump told reporters
trump already has appointed two justices to the supreme court solidifying its conservative majority
the circuit has judges who were appointed by democratic presidents and seven who were named by republican presidents
democratic presidents tend to appoint more liberal jurists while republican presidents favor more conservatives judges
it is one of the series of powerful regional federal appeals courts that are one step below the supreme court
these circuit courts often provide the last word in a legal dispute because the supreme court hears only a limited number of cases
the circuit hears appeals in federal cases spanning a huge region in terms of both geography and population covering the states of alaska arizona california hawaii idaho montana nevada oregon and washington
trump already has named two judges to the circuit with six other vacancies waiting to be filled
trump will not be able to create a conservative majority on the circuit however without additional vacancies caused when actively presiding judges retire
aided by fellow republicans in the senate trump has made it a top priority to rapidly appoint judges in a bid to make the federal judiciary more conservative
trump has suggested his policies do not get a fair shake in the circuit and has touted the idea of breaking up that court
trump last year decried the circuit s ridiculous ruling on the travel ban and said that court has a terrible record of being overturned by the supreme court an charge that the circuit s chief judge took issue with in congressional testimony
