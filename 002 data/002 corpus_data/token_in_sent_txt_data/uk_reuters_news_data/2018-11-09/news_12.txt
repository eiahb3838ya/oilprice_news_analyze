u.s. ethanol producers feeling the pinch from trump trade war
new reuters ethanol producers drew a bleak picture of their industry in quarterly filings and analyst calls this week detailing how the critical farm belt business has been devastated by president donald trump s trade war with china and biofuels management policies that they say have tilted toward oil refiners
the ethanol business had grown for years at breakneck speed but its outlook has dimmed due to washington s aggressive protectionist stance and the administration s unpredictable management of its renewable fuel program

the ethanol industry s view of trump s biofuels policy is a mixed bag
it has generally praised his recent decision to lift a summer ban of gasoline blended with percent ethanol or
that move could expand the domestic market for the fuel
still ethanol producers have blasted the environmental protection agency under trump for granting waivers exempting a record number of refineries from federal ethanol blending requirements
biofuel companies have complained that the move is an expensive political gift to the oil industry
the truth is that the waivers capped domestic demand growth for ethanol and really hurt the industry said geoff cooper head of the renewable fuels associations
the ethanol industry and corn state lawmakers have urged the epa to stop issuing the waivers and to compensate for lost ethanol blending volumes by requiring refineries to blend even more
the epa is in the process of finalizing its biofuels blending volumes requirements under the renewable fuel standard and is expected to unveil them by the end of the month
