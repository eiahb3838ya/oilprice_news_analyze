exclusive-russian state bank secretly financed rosneft sale after foreign buyers baulked
reuters it was billed as the deal that proved russia remained open for business
i want to congratulate you russian president vladimir putin told his trusted ally igor sechin after greeting him with a warm handshake in the kremlin in december
sechin had just announced the sale to qatar s sovereign wealth fund and giant commodity trader glencore of a percent stake in rosneft the state oil giant that he runs
the billion euro billion privatization deal was designed to replenish russia s coffers depleted by falling energy prices and western sanctions
some russian officials hailed it as proof that despite growing political isolation from the west the country could still attract global investors
but now nearly two years after the sale was first announced nine sources with knowledge of the transaction have told reuters that vtb a russian bank itself financed a large share of the acquisition undermining the deal s stated aim to bring foreign money into the country
based on accounts from five of the sources the value of the russian loan to the qatari sovereign wealth fund is around billion
vtb denied it issued a loan to the qatari sovereign wealth fund called the qatar investment authority qia
vtb has not issued and is not planning to issue a loan to qia to finance the vtb data for september published by the russian central bank showed that vtb loaned billion roubles billion for up to three years to unnamed foreign borrowers after having raised billion roubles via loans from the central bank itself
vtb s financial results published on showed that during the third quarter the volume of loans to its biggest borrowers had gone up by billion roubles or approximately billion
vtb declined to comment on the transactions and the central bank did not respond to questions
the qia declined to comment
the kremlin did not comment
rosneft did not respond to questions about the vtb loan to qatar
rosneft the world s biggest listed oil company by output is the jewel in russia s corporate crown
but with russia under sanctions and facing the prospect of more sanctions to come sechin faced an uphill task in finding buyers or creditors willing to risk their own money to acquire a stake in rosneft
the sanctions imposed by the united states and european union in the aftermath of russia s annexation of ukraine s crimea region limit the access of russian firms to international debt markets
in the end to get foreign investors on board russia has had to loan them billions according to the sources account
two sources familiar with the deal said that having a third party finance a large part of the acquisition was a condition for qatar taking the stake
with oil prices today significantly higher than in late russia s need for foreign money has subsided
but should it need to tap international markets again the story of the rosneft sale points to the challenges it could face in bringing investors on board especially as the united states levies more sanctions against russia
the nine sources who told reuters about the vtb loan to qatar included a source close to vtb management a russian central bank official and a russian government source familiar with foreign investments in russia
at least four of the sources were directly involved in preparations for the loan
all the sources requested anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss the deal
in response to questions about how the privatization of its stake as a whole was conducted rosneft said the deal was and transparent and in the interests of all shareholders
it said all decisions relating to the deal underwent the relevant procedures for corporate approval that the deal was supported by governments where participants are based and was subject to compliance procedures in the relevant jurisdictions
this is a unique example of an effective privatization rosneft said in a statement
as the end of drew nearer sechin one of putin s closest lieutenants was under pressure
the government had publicly announced it would sell a percent stake in rosneft by the end of the year
the state budget battered by a collapse in oil prices an economic slump and the impact of western sanctions was showing a deficit of percent
russia s economy was in its second year of recession and there was no prospect of a quick improvement in public finances
by the autumn sechin who is now thought he had a buyer the united arab emirates sovereign wealth fund mubadala
according to two sources familiar with the developments mubadala agreed to buy the stake
but negotiations hit a snag after rosneft twice changed the price tag the two sources said prompting the emiratis to walk away from the deal
mubadala declined to comment
rosneft did not address questions about the mubadala discussions
sechin turned east and started talks with japanese officials according to a russian government official a source close to rosneft and a recording of a conversation involving sechin that emerged as part of an unrelated court case in which sechin was a witness
the talks were held primarily with the japanese economy trade and industry minister hiroshige seko
if the deal was agreed the owner of the stake would have become a large state japanese investment fund such as gpif the government pension investment fund which has over trillion assets under management or japan oil gas and metals national corp jogmec three sources familiar with the discussions told reuters
that deal also ran into difficulties according to sechin s account in the recording played in court when japan insisted on linking it to progress in a territorial dispute with russia dating back to the end of world war two
eventually the deal collapsed
japan s ministry of economy trade and industry did not respond to questions
rosneft did not address reuters questions about discussions with japan
jogmec s press service said it could not comment
gpif said it could not comment on a discussion between governments because it was not directly involved
still without a buyer sechin focused on two new potential suitors qatar s investment fund qia and global commodities trader glencore
neither was prepared to put up all of the asking price according to three sources
in the past rosneft had gone to major western banks such as deutsche bank and jp morgan to finance transactions but the big international lenders have announced no major new loan deals with rosneft since sanctions were imposed in
in stepped intesa sanpaolo a italian lender which had little experience in large russian corporate deals
by early december financing for the deal was falling into place
the buyers put in some of their own money qatar gave billion euros and glencore million euros
the rest was debt of which intesa put up billion euros
the balance according to glencore at the time would come from unnamed russian banks
the amount coming from the russian banks was about billion
two banking sources close to rosneft told reuters that vtb was one of the banks that between them put up billion in loans back in
those sources said the other russian banks involved were gazprombank and otkritie which like vtb have kremlin connections although otkritie was privately held at the time
it is not clear what share of the billion each of the three banks contributed
that contribution from vtb toward the billion was separate to around billion that according to the nine sources vtb provided to qatar this year
in response to questions about the initial billion in loans vtb said it did not provide financing but it was the coordinating bank on behalf of rosneft
otkritie declined to comment
gazprombank did not respond to questions
for the larger portion of the financing the billion euros loaned by intesa the italian bank s intention was to syndicate the loan a common industry practice designed to spread the risk and dilute the burden on the bank s own capital
but two banking sources and a source familiar with the italian side of the deal said the syndication failed because european banks approached by intesa were worried about the risk that providing finance for rosneft even if indirectly would result in them falling foul of western sanctions on russia
rosneft and sechin are both subject to sanctions
intesa declined to comment
at the time of the december announcement and in the weeks afterwards russian officials spoke publicly of a partnership with the new rosneft shareholders qatar and glencore
but it became clear that the agreement was still in flux when in september sechin said a deal had been signed for chinese energy firm cefc to buy percent of rosneft from qatar and glencore
explaining why the original deal had not stuck he told russian state television the new shareholders were finding the cost of servicing the debt too high
the chinese deal though was never closed
before it was sealed cefc s founder and chairman ye jianming was taken in for questioning and investigated by chinese authorities for suspected economic crimes
since then there has been no word on the status of the investigation or if ye has been charged
he was named however in a graft trial of a senior communist party official state broadcaster cctv reported last month
neither ye nor cefc responded to calls from reuters seeking comment
once again sechin was in search of a buyer
finally in may this year qatar agreed to take on the part of the stake that had been covered by intesa
officially no one has said how the new deal with qatar is being financed or who is providing the finance
it is clear that intesa s role has ended
a document dated and lodged with singapore s official business register where the vehicle that held the stake on behalf of qatar and glencore is registered stated that intesa had ceased to be the creditor for the stake and no longer held shares as collateral
the document did not state who was the new creditor
according to the nine sources familiar with the arrangement that new creditor is vtb
at a reception at the italian embassy in moscow last november to receive an award for services to italy sechin champagne glass in hand linked arms with a russian man in fashionable glasses
it was andrey kostin the chief executive of the bank that helped to finance the privatization russia s vtb
