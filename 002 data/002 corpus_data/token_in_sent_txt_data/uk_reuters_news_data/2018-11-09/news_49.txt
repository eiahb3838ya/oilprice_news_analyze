column-china's record crude oil imports built on robust fundamentals, temporary boosts: russell
launceston australia reuters china s record imports of crude oil in october are without a doubt a bullish outcome but within the broader pattern of growing demand there were some temporary factors lifting purchases
china imported million tonnes of crude in october equivalent to million barrels per day bpd a figure that beat the previous record of million bpd from april
imports jumped a massive percent from the same month a year earlier and also by percent from september according to customs data
it s probably worth trying to split the underlying trend in china s oil imports from the factors that can cause outcomes such as october s record
the chinese oil import story is still one of strength with economic growth falling domestic output and the ongoing strategic storage buildup all contributing
for the first months of the year china the world s biggest crude buyer imported million bpd a gain of percent over the same period in
none of the three factors driving china s underlying import growth show any sign of changing dramatically in the short to medium term
even though china s economic growth has softened slightly as the united states imposes trade tariffs it s likely that stimulus measures will help to keep gross domestic product expanding at a rate above percent
it s also likely that china s domestic oil production will continue its gentle slide as shown by the percent drop to million bpd in the first three quarters of the year compared to the same period a year earlier
china is also still some way from completing its goal of holding reserves equivalent to days of import cover with the international energy agency estimating it held million barrels at the end of
china doesn t disclose how much crude it is directing into its strategic reserves although various energy analysts believe it is in the region of bpd
against this backdrop of solid underlying demand growth october added a couple of factors that are unlikely to be permanent
the first is that smaller independent refiners were active in the month buying almost million bpd which is a record high according to data from refinitiv oil research and forecasts
the independents were likely buying crude to use up their import quotas before they expired raising the possibility that demand from this sector will moderate a touch in coming months
there also seemed to be a bit of rush to buy iranian crude before the resumption of sanctions against the islamic republic s exports
imports from iran were bpd in october according to refinitiv data which was percent higher than september s bpd
the above numbers come with a caveat insofar as it s becoming harder to track iranian exports as the country s tankers have started disabling their systems
it may have been the case that chinese importers were stocking up on iranian crude ahead of the renewed sanctions
this raises the possibility that china may wind back purchases in coming months especially since the administration of president donald trump decided to grant waivers to eight buyers of iranian crude including top purchasers china and india for a period of six months
it s also worth noting that china s exports of refined products were only slightly weaker in october than in september with million tonnes being shipped down from million
this equates to about million bpd of product exports with chinese refiners likely to be keen to sell into the strong regional market for middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel where the profit margins are at or close to highs
china s product exports are up percent in the first months of the year compared to the same period last year
overall the picture that emerges is that china s appetite for imported crude oil remains strong and growing and october s record while boosted by temporary factors is unlikely to last for too long given the robust fundamentals
