the island has seen its financial situation deteriorate in recent months following the deepening of venezuela s economic crisis lower revenue from commodity and related exports devastation wrought by hurricane irma and tightening of business and travel restrictions by the administration under president donald trump
in cuba reached a debt deal with members of the paris club of creditor nations but having not dealt with its defaulted commercial creditors in the london club means the country is in effect shut out of international capital markets
the committee reached out to cuba in late january said rodrigo coordinator of the creditor group and a law professor at london s queen mary university
we have made a good faith proposal to the the creditor group holds obligations representing a face value of billion worth of cuban debt and is made up of three funds stancroft trust ltd adelante exotic debt fund ltd and crf i ltd as well as one commercial bank
we are trying to give the country another chance to reach an amicable understanding with creditors told reuters
this would give them very beneficial terms to remedy their situation capital while details of the proposal were confidential it would convey very significant debt relief said lee buchheit at cleary gottlieb steen hamilton llp one of the world s top restructuring lawyers who was retained by the group last year
cuba negotiated a generous debt relief package with most of its bilateral creditors at the very end of buchheit told reuters
the london club offer draws on certain features of the deal with the bilateral creditors but in some respects it is even more generous to the under the deal a number of paris club of creditor nations forgave billion of billion official debt it had defaulted on through plus charges
repayment of the remaining debt was structured over years and havana paid the first two instalments due since
as part of the accord some creditors were also preparing to swap debt for an equity stake in local development projects
this was seen as a breakthrough with cuba agreeing for the first time to give rich capitalist countries equity in development projects in sectors like manufacturing and agriculture
cuba does not publish information on its foreign debt citing a need to keep sensitive economic information from washington which it has long accused of trying to disrupt its financial and trade relations under a comprehensive sanctions regime
however the creditor group estimated it was holding at least percent of cuba s private sector debt
added the proposal would be open for a limited period of time though declined to give further detail
cuba s cash crunch and lower oil supplies from venezuela have forced the government to slash imports and reduce the use of fuel and electricity
