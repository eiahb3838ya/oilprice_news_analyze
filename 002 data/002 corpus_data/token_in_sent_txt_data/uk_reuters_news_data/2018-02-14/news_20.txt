dutch plan to build giant offshore solar power farm
amsterdam feb reuters an offshore seaweed farm in the north sea will be turned into a large solar power farm that aims to pipe energy to the dutch mainland in roughly three years
the project comes at a critical time for the netherlands which is struggling to curb fossil fuel use and meet greenhouse gas emission targets after years of underinvestment in renewable energy sources
after an initial pilot next year a consortium comprising energy producers scientists and researchers plans to ultimately operate square metres of floating solar panels by said allard van hoeken founder of oceans of energy which devised the project
the pilot which will have million euros million in government funding will operate square meters of panels from this summer
it will test equipment weather conditions environmental impact and energy output
utrecht university will examine energy production at the offshore prototype located around kilometres nine miles off the coast of dutch city of the hague at a testing zone known as the north sea farm
in addition to removing the problem of a land shortage there are several other benefits to building at sea similar to those in wind energy said solar energy expert wilfried van sark at utrecht university who is involved in the project
there is more sun at sea and there is the added benefit of a cooling system for the panels which boosts output by up to percent he said
if successful there is plenty of space to expand the farm unlike on the overcrowded dutch mainland where there has been public opposition to wind turbines
the panels will be more rugged than ordinary onshore models to account for the harsher weather conditions and tidal shifts at sea van sark said
the panels will be moored between existing wind turbines and connected to the same cables transporting energy efficiently to end users
van hoeken said he expects offshore solar energy to eventually be cheaper than offshore wind and mainland power sources due mainly to a lack of land costs
