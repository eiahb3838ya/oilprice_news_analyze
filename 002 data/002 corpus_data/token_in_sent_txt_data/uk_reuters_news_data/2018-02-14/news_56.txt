rpt-focus-sime darby's africa ambitions stall pending new deforestation rules
repeats with no changes to text sime has planted ha at its liberia concession uncertainty over new rspo rules main reason for stall new rules expected by november on planting in forested areas africa disappoints as new frontier for palm oil by edward mcallister and emily chow gbah lumpur feb reuters when malaysia s biggest plantation company sime darby leased hectares of lush forest in northwest liberia in executives said they had found a much needed new frontier in global palm oil development
undulating hills a tropical climate and plenty of untouched land made the west african country s interior ideal for palm oil growers running out of room in southeast asia
nine years later however sime darby plantation has planted only hectares in liberia and has not laid a seed in two years stalled by uncertainties over new environmental standards
we are losing money
we have to balance our books or there is no future said david parker the head of sime darby plantations in liberia
in its earnings report for the financial year ending in june sime darby said it had filed a million ringgit million impairment a permanent reduction in the value of the asset on its liberia operations
the operations were affected by a number of factors including the ebola outbreak and more stringent environmental plans that have stalled expansion since it said
the billion palm oil industry is considering whether to adopt new no deforestation rules for an oil found on supermarket shelves across the world from cooking oil to snack food and soups to soaps
the rules mark a more environmentally friendly form of palm oil development but leave producers with a major conundrum how to meet growing demand and make money with so much land now potentially off limits
the debate is unfolding at the roundtable on sustainable palm oil rspo an industry watchdog that consists of planters companies and ngos
while awaiting those rules sime darby has stopped planting palm in liberia parker said
olam international in gabon has also paused development on all but grassland areas until the rules are published said ranveer chauhan its managing director of edible oils
but back at corporate headquarters in kuala lumpur sime says it is trying out a new method using satellite data to measure a forest s carbon content so it can tell exactly how much land it can and can not develop
a new plan for land development in liberia is currently being prepared following the completion of these trials sime s chief sustainability officer simon lord told reuters
darrel webber chief executive officer at the rspo secretariat in malaysia said he can not comment with the review under way and no conclusive decisions on the changes have been made yet
the rules are expected to come to a vote at rspo s annual meeting in november
concerns about the amount of forests and peatlands cleared for plantations and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere have plagued the palm oil industry for years
over the past decade consumer activist groups have pressed big palm oil buyers such as pepsico unilever and nestle with supermarket boycotts and other protests over palm oil s perceived links to climate change
many companies are willing to pay a premium price for palm oil labelled with a valued rspo sustainability certificate
the new rules will decide if land can be cleared for palm based on its carbon content
a dense forest might hold up to tonnes of carbon per hectare grassland about tonnes
if the rspo decides an area holding above tonnes an hectare is off limits then sime darby may be unable to develop most of its liberia concession said ahmad rifqi sime darby s manager of plantation sustainability in liberia
almost all here is over tonnes per hectare
the only areas are farmlands already cultivated by local communities he said
sime darby boasts of being the world s biggest producer of sustainable palm oil
it has an online dashboard displaying information about its supply chain and compliance with rspo rules
it s land bank of nearly hectares an area larger than puerto rico makes it the world s largest palm plantation firm by land size
the liberia concessions account for over a fifth of that
with governments and companies under increasing pressure to adhere to higher deforestation standards greenfield expansions in southeast asia have become uncommon says ivy ng regional head of plantations research at cimb investment bank in kuala lumpur
in recent years company expansion is largely via buying stakes of other companies ng said
sime darby s only major expansion in southeast asia since its merger with two other large plantation firms has been its acquisition of new britain palm oil in papua new guinea in
oil palm originated in west africa and was used there for thousands of years
and with global demand growing by an average percent a year growers had looked to africa to expand
yet production in africa has grown by less than percent since compared to around percent for southeast asia and globally
latin america is now the number two producing region
from a watchtower on sime darby s liberian plantation low lines of palm can be seen trailing to the horizon a duller green than the natural forest canopy that towers above the concession s edge
the serene view belies a cascade of troubles
local residents who claimed sime had encroached on community ands set up roadblocks to halt workers and stole keys from bulldozers community leaders and workers told reuters
sime says the land came from a government concession
but to appease residents it built schools and offers free medical services to workers and their families
its own ambitions meanwhile have shrunk
a new mill that doesn t have enough fruit to press into oil to run at full capacity and crop theft by local residents costs the company about percent of its harvest in some areas parker said
sime hopes to plant another hectares once it can show the first are profitable parker said
sime darby is committed to the long term if we can make a profit on the first reporting by edward mcallister in gbah liberia and emily chow in kuala lumpur
