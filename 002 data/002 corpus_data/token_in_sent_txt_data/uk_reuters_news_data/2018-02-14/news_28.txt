update 1-saudi arabia says prefers tighter oil market to early exit from cuts
falih says opec needs to adjust metrics targeted by cuts saudi says to keep exports below million bpd in march saudi king russia s novak discuss rebalancing opec s barkindo says oil demand growth to be healthy updates after end of news conference by rania el gamal riyadh feb reuters opec would do better to leave the oil market slightly short of supplies rather than ending too early a deal on cutting output saudi energy minister khalid said on wednesday
oil prices have slid nearly percent in the past three weeks together with a broader decline in the stock market due to fears about global inflation and rising oil production
the decline comes at a bad time for saudi arabia which needs high and stable oil prices if it is to succeed in turning the planned share listing of oil giant saudi aramco this year into the world s biggest share sale
if we have to err on the market a little bit so be it falih said after meeting russian energy minister alexander novak in riyadh
novak and other russian officials also met saudi king salman in the saudi capital on wednesday
rather than quitting too early and finding out we were dealing with less reliable information stay the course and make sure that inventories are where the industry needs them falih said
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries of which saudi arabia is leader has agreed to extend oil supply cuts with russia and other producers until the end of
moscow however has signalled a gradual exit might be needed from the second half of this year
falih has insisted the cuts will continue throughout and to avoid shocking the market any exit after that would be very gradual
on wednesday falih said opec and its allies would need to consider in coming months how to adjust targets including how to measure the average of oil stockpiles
opec has made the average its main target and managed to reduce the glut to million barrels above that benchmark from million when the cuts began in
falih said opec should take into account inventories floating storage and oil in transit
at present targets are based on stockpiles in industrialised oecd nations
it is way too premature to discuss an exit strategy do we need to adjust for rising demand and look at forward day cover
how do we deal with inventory
it s less transparent and reliable falih said
we have to think of the global market the centre of demand has shifted from oecd to we will discuss it in april and june
i think we are going to be sticking with our policy throughout and that is necessary to balance markets
as novak and falih met in riyadh the saudi energy ministry said it would restrain oil exports in march despite lower domestic need for crude
the kingdom will keep its crude exports below million barrels per day bpd next month despite a maintenance shutdown of the samref refinery the ministry said confirming a plan given by industry sources
saudi arabia remains focused on working down excess oil inventories a ministry spokesman said in a statement
market volatility is a common concern for producers and consumers and the kingdom is committed to mitigating this volatility and moderating its negative impacts by responsibly meeting its pledges under the supply deal
opec mohammad barkindo who was also in riyadh said oil demand would grow this year at healthy levels and that data pointed to continued high compliance by producers in january with their pledges under the supply deal
opec has delivered more than percent of the output cuts that members pledged under the deal according to figures from opec and other analysts helped in part by an involuntary drop in venezuela where output is falling amid an economic crisis
the saudi ministry also said production by aramco in march would be bpd below february s level suggesting saudi arabia will continue to pump less than its opec target
