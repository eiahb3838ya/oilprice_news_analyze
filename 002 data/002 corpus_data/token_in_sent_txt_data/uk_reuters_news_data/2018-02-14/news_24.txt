column-opec pact likely to evolve rather than terminate: kemp

the views expressed are his own chartbook by john kemp london feb reuters the lexicon of exit is not found in our vocabulary opec mohammad barkindo told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in cairo on monday
ministers from the organization of the petroleum exporting countries have been anxious to counter speculation about an early end to production curbs
barkindo was reinforcing the message that the current curbs will be maintained until at least the end of this year and could be continued into barkindo stresses ongoing cooperation not exit argus
opec will review progress towards its goal of eliminating excess global inventories at its next regular meeting in june but ministers have downplayed suggestions the review could lead to an early exit from the accord
the declaration of cooperation signed in december between opec led by saudi arabia and selected producers led by russia has become fundamental to opec s strategy for managing the oil market
both sides appear satisfied with the results achieved so far and keen to extend their cooperation in the medium term
global oil inventories have been cut to just over million barrels above the average down from million at the start of
benchmark brent prices have risen by around per barrel or almost percent since the production cuts were announced and futures prices have swung from contango into backwardation
saudi arabian energy minister khalid and his russian counterpart alexander novak are apostles to the value of cooperation barkindo told a separate conference in riyadh on wednesday
they have proven to be the key strong pillars on which the historic opec and cooperation has been built introductory remarks by opec
the agreement between opec and oil producers is therefore likely to be extended and evolve rather than terminated
in that sense barkindo is correct to note exit is not on the agenda
the critical question is how and when the agreement is modified not whether it is ended completely
the most likely outcome is that the agreement is eventually adjusted to include a new set of higher production limits while maintaining the framework of regular meetings between opec and producers
but with saudi arabia and russia among the only signatories that have the capacity to boost output and benefit from higher production limits securing a broad agreement is likely to prove tricky
production restraint has been far more successful in drawing down excess global oil stocks than most analysts expected or indeed opec itself originally expected egypt petroleum show opec
crude oil stocks remain around million barrels above the average but if they were pushed down to that level the oil market would almost certainly feel very tight given the growth in consumption since
stocks of refined products are already close to the average and in some cases below it which has left many fuel markets feeling
while opec insists stocks need to fall further by most indicators the oil market has already rebalanced and is now firmly in the tightening phase of the cycle
if opec and its allies maintain their production curbs too long oil prices will rise and spur an even more drilling and production from shale producers
the most recent forecasts for production and consumption show shale producers and other suppliers will essentially capture all the forecast demand growth in
if opec and its allies maintain their production curbs they may secure higher prices but only at the expense of losing more market share
the dilemma of whether to prioritise the price defence or protect market share is familiar
opec has regularly alternated between price defence and market share protection for years
before june the organisation was focused on protecting prices above per barrel even at the expense of losing market share to shale producers
between june and june the priority shifted towards recapturing market share at the expense of a wrenching slump in prices
since december the focus has been on cutting excess oil stocks and pushing up prices even though it has cost some market share especially in asia
the strategy of cutting stocks and boosting prices has been successful but the costs associated with it are starting to rise as shale producers capture more and more of global demand growth
at some point opec and its allies will be forced to shift their focus back towards boosting output and stemming the erosion of their market share
the only question is when
opec and its allies will probably adjust the declaration at some point to include higher production limits with the aim of defending their market share without triggering a steep fall in prices
the challenge is to get the timing and the scale of the output increase right so the extra supply is absorbing by growing consumption
but experience suggests opec will leave the adjustment too late tighten the market too much and send prices surging
the organisation will then increase supply at the moment when supply is accelerating and demand growth is already slowing
opec allowed the market to tighten too much after both the two previous slumps in and with the result that prices overshot its initial targets
something similar is likely in
the other challenge for opec is managing market expectations
hedge funds and other money managers have built a record bullish position in crude in the expectation that opec and its allies will continue to restrain output and continue to tighten the market well into
by fund managers has helped accelerate the accentuate the rise in oil prices and provided an early harvest for opec and its allies
any sign that producers are preparing to increase their output could trigger a rush to exit from some of those bullish positions and a sharp fall in prices
tricky most opec members would prefer to tighten the oil market too much and benefit from a revenue windfall rather than risk not tightening it enough and a renewed fall in prices
saudi arabia the organisation s de facto leader and the real swing producer needs relatively high prices to balance the government budget and pay for ambitious social and economic modernisation programmes
the kingdom also needs high prices to help secure a favourable valuation in the forthcoming sale of sale of shares in its national oil company aramco
most other opec members also need higher prices to cut their budget deficits and maintain internal social stability
among the signatories to the declaration of cooperation russia has expressed some reservations about the need to protect market share but has so far agreed to continue with a strategy
ultimately most opec and members are aware of the dangers of pushing prices too high but negotiating revised production limits will prove tricky
saudi arabia kuwait and russia are probably the only signatories with the capacity to boost their output significantly in the short term
other opec and members have little to gain from higher production limits and would prefer higher prices instead
saudi arabia and russia have the ability to raise production unilaterally or in agreement with each other but will probably want to maintain the broader framework of cooperation painstakingly built since
since negotiating an upward revision of production limits could prove contentious it is easier for opec and producers to continue with the existing agreement for as long as possible
