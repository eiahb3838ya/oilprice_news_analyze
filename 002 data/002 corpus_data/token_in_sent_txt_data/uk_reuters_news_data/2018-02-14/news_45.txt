iran's rouhani seeks indian investment amid u.s. pressure
new delhi feb reuters iranian president hassan rouhani will be seeking billions of dollars of indian investment during a visit to new delhi diplomats said a trip that comes amid pressure to review a international nuclear deal and sanctions on iran
india is trying to develop the port of chabahar on iran s east coast as a way to gain access the markets of central asia as well as afghanistan by pakistan
but progress is slow because of concern that president donald trump s administration may eventually scrap the iran nuclear deal
soon after the sanctions were lifted india said its firms could spend as much as billion on not just the port but also petrochemical plants railway lines and other industries in the areas
but progress has only been made on the port
iranian officials say the slowdown is largely because india has become hesitant following trump s attempts to undermine the iran nuclear deal and that rouhani would be urging india to make good on its commitments
there are a number of projects for expansion of ties in the pipeline that not only will be in the interests of both nations but also in the interest of the region iran s ambassador to india gholamreza ansari said in a national day speech last week
rouhani who arrives in the southern city of hyderabad on thursday where he will address a muslim congregation will hold talks with prime minister narendra modi on saturday
the two sides are expected to sign an agreement allowing india to run operations in the first phase of the chabahar port project
the port is about km from the pakistani port of gwadar which china is developing
the plan is for india to equip and operate two berths in the port with a capital investment of million on a lease
modi has said the government could spend up to million on the port india s first major overseas port venture as it tries to offer alternatives to china s one belt one road initiative to build trade and transport links across asia
but the uncertainty over policies has cast a shadow over the project officials say
india is struggling to get equipment such as cranes for the port because western banks were not ready to facilitate transactions
they don t want to antagonise the said an indian source involved in the port s development but who is not authorised to speak to the media
the banks american interests are more important the moment you mention that the destination is iran they don t come iran had hoped for swift reintegration into global trade after the easing of sanctions in but its failure to persuade western banks to accept iranian business has been the main roadblock to rehabilitation
indian officials said the two sides were also trying to narrow differences over a giant gas field that an indian consortium led by oil and natural gas corp discovered a decade ago
india wants to develop the farzad b gas field but iran says the terms it has offered are not profitable
