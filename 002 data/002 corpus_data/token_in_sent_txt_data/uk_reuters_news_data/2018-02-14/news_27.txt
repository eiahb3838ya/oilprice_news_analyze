analysis-hail shale, but deepwater oil fights back
london reuters penguins royal dutch shell s latest oil and gas development in a remote corner of the british north sea epitomises the new doctrine for deepwater projects keep it cheap and simple
shunned during the oil price crash of deepwater projects are being embraced again a challenge to the surge in onshore shale output
penguins the first new major deepwater project this year will rejuvenate the field by drilling new wells metres feet underwater and connecting them to a new production vessel
due for completion in at a cost of around billion penguins will cost a fraction of the average of giant developments earlier this decade producing a modest barrels of oil equivalent a day
it is another example of how we are unlocking development opportunities with lower costs andy brown head of shell s oil and gas production division said
like shell companies such as exxon mobil total and bp have in recent years radically changed the way they design offshore fields deploying steel platforms out at sea to make them simpler and faster to build and able to challenge the economics of shale fields such as the permian basin in texas
as executives gain confidence that their companies can make a profit with oil at around a barrel less than half the level of the early boards are set to approve more projects
oil currently trades at around a barrel
analysts at bernstein expect around new offshore projects to be approved in compared with last year and in when project numbers fell to the lowest since at least
companies including exxon shell and bp have set a rigid cost ceiling for new projects requiring them to be profitable with oil at a barrel in order to withstand an uncertain outlook clouded by the rise of electric vehicles
as a result most new projects are set to be significantly smaller than the traditional field size averaging barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with last year according to bernstein
you will see more deepwater over time for sure bernard looney head of bp s oil and gas production division told reuters in january
bp is expected to approve a number of projects this year he added including in senegal mauritania oman and azerbaijan
leaner projects can be achieved by drilling simpler wells and connecting them to existing platforms and pipelines in what is known as infill drilling or by swapping bespoke gear for equipment and by processing vast amounts of data to streamline oil field construction
a sharp drop in rig and services costs by as much as percent in some cases over the past three years has further helped reduce the cost of projects
much is made of the permian its flexibility and the returns there
but actually infill drilling for a decade creates enormous sources of money looney said
offshore oil projects there are exceptions to the rule
some fields are so vast that they require massive investment while remaining profitable at low oil prices
among the largest projects expected to be approved this year are petrobras s libra ii in brazil at an expected cost of billion shell s bonga southwest in nigeria at billion and exxon s mamba liquefied natural gas lng project in mozambique at billion according to analysts at jefferies
for all the buzz around shale production it accounts for around percent of the world s crude supply of around million barrels per day while offshore production accounts for over one quarter
the scale of the highly complex projects one platform can produce bpd in some cases helped tap new resources in recent decades to meet surging global demand for energy
but some deepwater projects were plagued by huge cost and delays one of the most famous examples being the giant kazakh field kashagan later dubbed as costs ballooned from billion to billion
but after years of spending cuts companies urgently need to develop new resources to offset the natural decline of fields which can reach percent per year
when you look at the mix you need offshore you need deepwater
the onshore by itself won t be enough to make up for the decline rates that you are seeing globally lorenzo simonelli chief executive officer of energy services company baker hughes told reuters
exxon the world s top publicly traded oil company last year gave the for the development of the liza field in guyana
the project is expected to generate returns with oil at the company said
oil majors have made a number of major discoveries in recent months exxon in guyana bp in the north sea shell in the gulf of mexico eni and total offshore cyprus and their development will hinge on keeping costs low
discipline has to stay we re very determined in this space
we re not going to say that now that the oil prices are back up let s do more let s spend more bp s looney said
