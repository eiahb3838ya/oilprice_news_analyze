oecd says energy taxes in developed economies too low to fight climate change
london reuters energy taxes in major advanced economies are not doing enough to reduce energy use improve energy efficiency and drive a shift towards sources the organisation for economic and development oecd said on wednesday
taxes on energy use such as fuel carbon taxes and excise duties are used by many governments to make energy consumers pay for the costs of pollution thereby reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions which lead to global warming
the oecd examined taxes on energy use between and in oecd and economies which represent around percent of global energy use and carbon emissions from energy use
the study did not include carbon market prices such as in the eu s emissions trading system but the oecd said they do little to change the report s findings
the oecd found that almost all taxes are too low to help combat global warming compared to a benchmark level of euros per tonne of carbon dioxide a conservative minimum estimate of the damage from emitting one tonne of
a bird s eye view of effective taxes per tonne of across all countries reveals that there is hardly any change in the tax rates on emissions outside the road transport sector the report said
taxes continue to be poorly aligned with environmental and climate costs of energy use across all countries it added
in the road transport sector percent of emissions are taxed and rates were above for percent of emissions in compared to percent in
in sectors which collectively account for percent of carbon emissions from energy use percent of emissions were untaxed and rates were below for percent of emissions
coal which accounts for almost half of carbon emissions in the countries goes untaxed in many countries and was taxed above in just five countries examined
taxes on oil products were relatively high at over on average across all sectors and particularly high in road transport a sector which remains almost entirely dependent on oil products
taxes on diesel for transport use are lower than taxes for gasoline in every country except two although this pattern appears to be changing the report said
some governments have started to raise diesel fuel taxes amid pressure to improve air quality in major cities
apart from transport fuel tax increases in some large income economies and some first steps towards aligning diesel taxes with gasoline taxes there is no structural change to the pattern of taxes on energy use between and the oecd said
