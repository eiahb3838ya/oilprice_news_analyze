factbox-the three sticking points of long-term lng contracts
singapore feb reuters the arbitration between australia s north west shelf nws liquefied natural gas lng project and korea gas corp kogas over the price of an expired supply contract comes as asian buyers are putting pressure on producers to grant more flexible supply terms
most of asia s lng is supplied under contracts that ensure buyers get regular supplies through fixed monthly cargoes and grant producers a steady stream of revenue
before when supplies were tight buyers were willing to sign up to terms that allowed them little flexibility on price and volume
but with supplies now more abundant lng buyers are demanding changes
there are three sticking points which buyers are contesting
lng buyers receive fixed monthly volumes
even if a buyer cancels a cargo due to a period of unusually low demand payment is still due under obligations
most asian supply contracts contain destination clauses that prevent buyers from lng to third parties
to protect buyers and sellers from sharp price swings the lng under most contracts is indexed to oil under what are known as
when oil prices rise quickly the grants buyers a slope once oil has reached a level under which the price for lng rises more slowly and with a
sellers of lng are granted a similar slope which slows down a price fall in oil once crude has fallen to a certain level
buyers prefer a flat slope at high oil prices while lng producers and sellers prefer flat slopes at low oil prices
in most existing contracts a slope of around percent of oil prices is applied under a time lag versus crude of several weeks or even months
many buyers are now asking for a lower slope of percent to percent
at current prices for brent crude oil of around per barrel a reduction of the slope from percent to percent for buyers would lead to a fall in the lng price of per million british thermal units mmbtu to per mmbtu
many lng supply contracts span years some even decades
typically a window for review is allowed at defined periods
should no agreement be reached during such review periods the contracts include the possibility of going into arbitration where both sides agree an arbiter to resolve the dispute without involving a legal court
between and european utilities entered into dozens of cases against producers at specialist courts in paris london and stockholm mostly winning awards in their favour
the kogas case with north west shelf is asia s first lng arbitration to become public
the singapore international arbitration centre siac is lobbying to become asia s key lng arbitration centre
