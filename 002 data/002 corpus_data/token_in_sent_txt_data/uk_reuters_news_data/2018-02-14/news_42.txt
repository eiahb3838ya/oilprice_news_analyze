update 2-appeal court rules nigerians cannot pursue shell spill claim in england
nigeria reuters the court of appeal in london ruled on wednesday that two nigerian communities can not pursue royal dutch shell in english courts over oil spills in nigeria s delta region
the split decision upheld a high court ruling last year that was a setback to attempts to hold british multinationals liable at home for their subsidiaries actions abroad
the court rejected the appeal from law firm leigh day on behalf of nigeria s bille and ogale communities and upheld a ruling that english courts do not have jurisdiction over claims against shell s nigerian subsidiary shell petroleum development company spdc
spdc is jointly operated with the nigerian government
shell said the court rightly upheld the earlier ruling and said nigeria s justice system was the correct place for the claims
its subsidiary spdc has also denied responsibility for the spills which it says were due to sabotage and illegal refining
one of the three senior high court judges the rt
hon
lord justice sales disagreed with the majority ruling writing that the communities have a good arguable claim that shell assumed a material degree of responsibility in relation to the management of the pipeline and facilities operated by spdc
leigh day said the two nigerian communities intended to bring the case to britain s supreme court
we are hopeful that the supreme court will grant permission to appeal and will come to a different view leigh day partner daniel leader said
king okpabi the ruler of the ogale community said the english courts were the only hope and that they can not get justice in nigeria
the case is significant in determining whether multinational companies can face legal action in england over their subsidiaries actions abroad
last year an appeals court upheld a ruling that a case brought by zambian villagers against mining company vedanta resources over environmental pollution could be heard in england
vedanta said it would seek the right to appeal to the supreme court
