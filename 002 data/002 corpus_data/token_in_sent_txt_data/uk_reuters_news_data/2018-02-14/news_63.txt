update 4-trump weighs tariffs, quotas on u.s. steel, aluminum imports
washington reuters president donald trump said on tuesday he was considering a range of options to address steel and aluminium imports that he said were unfairly hurting producers including tariffs and quotas
trump s comments his strongest signal in months that he will take at least some action to restrict imports of the two metals came in a meeting with a bipartisan group of senators and representatives at the white house
reporters were present for part of the meeting
some of the lawmakers urged him to act decisively to save steel and aluminium plants in their states but others urged caution because higher prices would hurt downstream manufacturers that consume steel and aluminium
trump is weighing options presented last month by the commerce department in parallel section investigations into whether import restrictions on steel and aluminium are needed to protect national security
the probes were authorized under a trade law that has not been invoked since
what we re talking about is tariffs quotas trump said to the group
part of the options would be tariffs coming in
as they dump steel they pay tariffs substantial tariffs which means the united states would actually make a lot of trump said that the steel and aluminium industries were being decimated by dumping and talked about the empty steel mills he saw on the campaign trail in
i look at it two ways i want to keep prices down but i also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminium industry and we do need that for national defence trump said
steel stocks rose broadly after the comments with the s p steel index closing up percent and outperforming the broader market
alcoa inc shares ended percent higher with century aluminum up percent
trump now has until around april to decide whether to impose steel import curbs and april to decide on aluminium restrictions
the commerce department has not revealed its recommendations in the probes launched last spring
but commerce secretary wilbur ross told the lawmakers that section powers can be applied in a much more surgical way that could lead to tariffs on imports from certain countries and quotas from other nations suspected of transhipping products
some lawmakers came away from the meeting with the impression that trump would impose some restrictions but understood the need for a balanced approach
my belief is he ll take some action but he was truly open to seeking input at the meeting today senator roy blunt a missouri republican told reporters at the capitol
blunt who said missouri industries both make and consume steel and aluminium told trump in the meeting i think we do need to be careful here that we don t start a reciprocal battle on several lawmakers cited the need to maintain energy independence and the electrical grid
they urged steps to protect producers of oil drilling and transport pipe and noted ak steel is the last american producer of electrical steel for electric transformers
senator rob portman a republican from ohio told trump that without relief from imports ak steel is going to pull out of this business so we won t have the steel that goes into our transformers and our republican senator pat toomey of pennsylvania cautioned that it would be difficult for trump to justify a national security ruling when defence products consume only percent of domestic steel so i think it s implausible to believe that we re not able to meet the needs of our defence industry which is absolutely essential he said
steelmakers recently urged trump to take broad action to reduce steel imports to curb global excess steel production capacity largely in
asked about trump s steel comments chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said the world economy was recovering and all parties should cherish the momentum and send signals of cooperation and mutual benefit
at this time any unilateral or protectionist moves would harm countries and damage the trade environment geng told reporters in beijing
all parties should make an effort to avoid a chinese government warned earlier that unreasonable trade actions on steel will be met with countermeasures under world trade organization rules
steel and aluminium users meanwhile have urged caution in any restrictions to avoid disruptions or price spikes in the raw materials used in everything from autos to appliances and aircraft and construction
the motor and equipment manufacturers association representing auto parts makers with employees urged trump in a letter on tuesday to exclude an extensive list of products from import restrictions from tire cord steel to aluminium die castings
