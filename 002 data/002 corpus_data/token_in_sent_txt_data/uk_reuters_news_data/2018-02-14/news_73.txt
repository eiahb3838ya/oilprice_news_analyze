update 3-australia's woodside to raise $2 bln, look to offshore gas project for growth
melbourne reuters woodside petroleum australia s biggest independent gas and oil producer launched a surprise a billion billion share sale on wednesday to raise funds to take control of and develop a gas field off the country s west coast
woodside said on wednesday it had agreed to pay million for exxonmobil corp s stake in the scarborough field a project that has been stuck on the drawing board for nearly years due to factors including its remote deepwater location
the company said that soaring international demand for gas meant the time was right for the acquisition with the field expected to feed an expansion of its pluto liquefied natural gas lng plant in the state of western australia
the difference between supply and demand is opening up very very quickly said woodside chief executive peter coleman adding that chinese appetite for lng was growing rapidly
but some analysts underscored the challenges of developing the field with ben wilson at royal bank of canada describing the site in a broker note as deep distant dirty and dry
the move puts woodside seen as short on growth prospects in control of scarborough with a stake working with bhp billiton on a project now estimated to cost up to billion
the rest of the money raised through the a billion offer to existing shareholders will be used to support work on scarborough the browse lng project in australia and the sne oil development off senegal
analysts said that even with the large equity raising woodside may have to come back to investors in a few years to fund the development of scarborough and browse
woodside has a market value of a billion there s a lot of money to pay said macquarie analyst andrew hodge
the company announced the scarborough deal after reporting an rise in annual profit of billion just short of analyst forecasts
woodside s shares were on a trading halt for the offering which closes on thursday
it is offering one new share for every nine shares owned at a a share a discount to woodside s last trade
the company also said it was pushing out a final investment decision on the browse lng project off western australia to a year later than last flagged and now estimated to cost billion to get to
a lot of woodside capital is due to be chewed up in coming years with the senegal scarborough and browse developments said saul kavonic an analyst at consultants wood mackenzie
all face uncertainties and risk delays but scarborough could now prove the most of the bhp billiton welcomed woodside s expanded role in scarborough
this development could enhance the commercial viability of scarborough and the region bhp s petroleum president steve pastor said in a comment emailed to reuters
part of the million cost of the stake in scarborough will only be due when the project in meters of water with no liquids to boost the value of the gas gets its final
exxon aren t in the habit of making dumb decisions
they probably see more future in qatar png papua new guinea mozambique and golden pass in texas said andrew blakely an analyst at fund manager perpetual
