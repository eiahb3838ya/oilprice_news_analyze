india's $230 mln plan to stop crop burning that pollutes delhi falls short of estimates
new delhi reuters the indian government s plan to spend million over two years to prevent crop residue burning is below the spending estimates of its policy advisors for the task and may do little to cut the air pollution that envelops the capital region of delhi
prime minister narendra modi s cabinet is expected to sign off on the plan as early as this month three senior government officials involved in the talks told reuters
the planned expenditure is far less than the million per year that niti aayog a government policy advisory group estimated last november needed to be spent to prevent farmers from burning the crop waste left over after harvesting
it was not clear if the amount was recommended to the government
crop stubble burning caused of the air pollution that blanketed delhi in november the ministry of environment forest and climate change told parliament last week
the particles from the stubble burning combine with industrial pollution vehicle exhaust and dust to cover the region every year as winter approaches and wind speeds drop
the proposed plan would give money to farmers in three states bordering delhi punjab haryana and uttar pradesh to cover percent of the cost of machinery to remove the crop stubble said the officials who declined to be named ahead of cabinet discussions on the matter
this would keep the farmers from burning the residue ahead of winter planting
this is an important step but a lot will depend on how quickly the scheme is rolled out at a scale that can make a difference said anumita roychowdhury executive director of new the centre for science and environment
the government officials said the funding can be raised if needed but warned against expecting immediate results
we won t be able to improve more than to percent of air quality even if the crop residue scheme is fully implemented acknowledged one of the government officials
but we have to accept that the efforts to clean delhi s air will not take less than five modi s office did not respond to an email seeking comment
spokesmen for the farm and environment ministries declined to comment
in november delhi s pollution index climbed to times higher than the upper limit for healthy air
the air quality in central delhi on wednesday morning remains unhealthy at more than three times the limit according to the united states embassy in new delhi
delhi was dubbed a gas chamber by its chief minister and the federal government was widely criticized after united airlines suspended flights to new delhi because of the pollution
sri lankan cricket players threw up on the field during a match in the indian capital last december
government officials have vowed to reduce the pollution
a strong message has to go down that pollution is a serious economic and health issue and it is linked to our national image too environment minister harsh vardhan said at the launch of a clean air campaign last week
we mean business farmers are welcoming the plan since the majority of them can not afford the machinery on their own
for farmers the cost of most agricultural machineries are prohibitive said kartar singh a farmer from punjab
and that s why the subsidy will come as a relief to those who want to buy modern harvesters and straw management john deere and india s mahindra mahindra are some of the main sellers of farm machinery in india
other plans to deal with the stubble include state electric utility ntpc buying it to use as fuel in a power plant
