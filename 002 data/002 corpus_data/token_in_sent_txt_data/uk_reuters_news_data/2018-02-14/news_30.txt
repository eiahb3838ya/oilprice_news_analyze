analysis-higher wages, fuel prices turn up cost pressure on airlines
berlin reuters with inflation paramount in investors minds at a time of rising wages and oil prices the line separating winners and losers in the global airline industry this year looks likely to be drawn on how well they manage costs especially on the labor side
industry body iata in december flagged higher spending on labor and fuel which make up about half of airlines operating expenses as their members biggest challenge in especially after several years of record profits
labor costs surpassed fuel as global airlines biggest single expense in at percent of costs against just under percent for fuel
that is expected to jump this year to percent versus percent for fuel
back in when oil prices were much higher than now fuel was percent of expenses against percent for labor
staff costs are typically higher in north america and europe than in asia where fuel remains the biggest expense
the crux of the issue is that amid signs of a global shortage of workers generally in some regions there s also a scarcity of qualified pilots at a time of expanding fleets
as airlines have been making profit the workforce has got market power so that is pushing up the cost of labor iata chief economist brian pearce said in an interview
overall unit costs the measure of how much it costs an airline to operate each kilometer and seat flown will rise percent this year versus percent in iata forecasts
in the highest profile example of the pressures budget carrier ryanair was compelled last year by pilot shortages to cancel thousands of flights and in december recognized trade unions for the first time
the battle that forced ryanair s hand could put wage pressures on other european budget carriers such as wizz industry experts say
the bigger carriers feel it too
at air france unions representing pilots cabin and ground staff have called for a strike on to push a demand for a percent pay rise
after three years of strong profitability improvements in the sector we believe personnel and suppliers are asking for increases and thus keeping costs under control will remain a challenge for the sector kepler cheuvreux analyst ruxandra wrote
the wage issue has even extended to the united arab emirates the middle east trade and financial hub where labor disputes are rare and unions and industrial action are banned
the region s largest airline emirates is facing calls from cabin crew to improve conditions and benefits
employees say management is considering their requests
last week brokerage kepler cheuvreux cut its rating on german flagship carrier lufthansa already on its lists of stocks to avoid and least preferred in the sector to reduce from hold
in the united states investors are worried that the three largest carriers american delta and united are heading for a price war just as higher costs from pay increases agreed last year start to bite
lufthansa british airways parent iag and air are all expected to report improved profits when they publish results over the next few weeks
all airlines will need to look at areas where they can save however
the most successful airline managements are the ones that have been very every day not just on staff costs but on aircraft costs airport charges distribution costs and so on said aviation consultant john strickland
the success of ryanair which boasts of having the lowest costs in europe is partly down to hard negotiating with manufacturers and airports to get good deals on orders and fees those in the industry say
strickland said that while pilot costs would rise ryanair was unique in having much lower overall costs than rivals
if they can continue to keep other items such as airport and aircraft costs down then they will still be in a very strong lufthansa has been taking a tougher stance lately both with staff and airports
unlike in previous negotiations for its main brand in germany lufthansa stayed firm during a series of pilot strikes from to and has now struck a deal to cut its cockpit staff costs by percent while an increase in ground staff s wages will be partly linked to company profits
last year it also put pressure on frankfurt airport operator fraport by moving planes to munich
it predicts unit costs will fall by percent this year
analysts at barclays say while such measures should help lufthansa the rate of improvement is not sustainable and progress still needs to be made at budget unit eurowings which earns less than half the margin of its nearest peer
there is a significant amount more work for the company to do on its cost base they wrote in a note
along with strong travel demand thanks to robust economies and low oil prices last year european airlines have also benefited from some consolidation following the insolvencies of air berlin and monarch which helped lead to higher ticket prices
in addition many european carriers hedged on jet fuel unlike their counterparts who got burned making the wrong bets when the oil price starting tumbling in meaning the impact of higher fuel prices will come through for european airlines later than ones
easyjet s revenue per seat rose percent at constant currencies in the quarter to the airline said citing the struggles of rivals including air berlin monarch ryanair and alitalia
it forecast a rise of percent for the six months to march
airlines need to be careful they don t lock themselves into cost structures that are too high for weaker economic conditions iata s pearce warned
at the moment they re not doing that but it s always a reporting by victoria bryan editing by sonya hepinstall
