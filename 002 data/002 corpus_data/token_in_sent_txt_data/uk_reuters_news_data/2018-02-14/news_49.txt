rpt-in trump’s first year, us agency doubles solar investments abroad
los angeles feb reuters the united states government doubled its financial support for solar power projects overseas last year under a investment policy written in the last days of the obama administration according to a reuters review of government documents
the growing support for foreign solar projects comes despite an ongoing federal investigation into past solar loans abroad
it also deepens confusion about president donald trump s position on government support for renewable energy as his administration downplays the global warming threat and aggressively promotes development
the overseas private investment corporation the government s international finance institution loaned more than million to foreign energy projects in percent of which were solar wind or other ventures according to investment documents
that compares to million in total opic energy financing in percent of which went to clean energy
the agency s lending to solar projects doubled to more than million in supporting ventures in india africa and latin america according to the records

opic is a government agency whose website says it aims to advance
foreign policy and national security priorities by investing in ventures abroad
for years it has operated at no net cost to tax payers
the agency formalized its preference for energy in an environmental and social policy statement adopted days before trump s inauguration
the document says the agency aims to support reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promote and fuels and technologies efficiency and conservation
that dovetails with former president barack obama s effort to fight climate change but clashes with the current administration s energy priorities
since taking office trump has rolled back regulation limiting carbon dioxide emissions to help coal and oil firms signed an executive order requiring government agencies to reduce the influence of climate considerations in decisions and announced the withdrawal of the united states from an international pact to combat global warming
that might seem to suggest the administration would oppose continuing generous government support for solar a leading competitor to fossil fuels but the administration has never made that clear
trump has never proposed repealing the billions of dollars worth of federal incentives for renewable energy which were preserved by a congress in december tax legislation
but trump has expressed skepticism about the viability of solar and wind calling both very very in january trump slapped tariffs on solar panel imports saying the move would help domestic manufacturers
but what helps manufacturers may hurt solar installers that have relied on imported panels often from china
opic spokeswoman andrea orr said the agency adheres to the policy and that its portfolio is demand driven reflecting the shift globally toward lower carbon energy sources
but policy does not prohibit opic from considering the full spectrum of energy projects she said including in impoverished nations where fossil fuels are the most feasible option
opic s financing last year for example included million for a power plant in the west african nation of guinea that will run on fuel oil
last year trump sought to eliminate opic as part of his budget proposal to reduce unnecessary federal interventions that distort the free market but congress rejected the idea
trump has since appointed texas businessman ray washburne to lead the agency
washburne has said he would focus opic on two goals empowering women in the developing world and serving strategic national security interests
washburne was not available for an interview orr said
renewable energy projects that received opic funding last year include a honduras geothermal plant sponsored by ormat technologies a solar array in zambia backed by first solar inc and solar facilities in jordan and el salvador by power plant owner aes orb energy an indian solar company backed by venture capital fund acumen fund inc secured million in opic financing last year for commercial rooftop projects
such funding would not be available from india s conservative banking sector the company said
donald trump does not go out of his way to support solar or renewables so we were concerned orb chief executive damian miller said in an interview
but he was told there was no fundamental change in its priorities for selecting projects he said
since more than three quarters of energy generation projects that have received opic funding were for solar wind or other forms of renewable power
that approach has been a boon for renewable energy developers but has not always gone well for opic the agency is currently under investigation by a federal watchdog over nearly billion of loans to solar farms and a hydroelectric project in chile that got into financial trouble when power prices in that nation plummeted
at issue is whether opic properly the projects adequately before offering loans
the agency s losses on the deals could exceed million sources told reuters last year
opic has said it is confident it will recover the loans over the coming decades
aes which received up to million for its projects in jordan and el salvador in said it has tapped opic financing for more than a decade
the shift in the priorities matches the evolution over time at aes which now invests more in renewable energy and natural gas and less in oil and coal
that s the angle that the company has taken aes treasurer daniel stadelmann said in an interview referring to the company s shift toward cleaner energy sources
