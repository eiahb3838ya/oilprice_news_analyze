french start-up sigfox faces 5g juggernaut in internet of things
paris reuters french sigfox which builds networks to connect washing machines and other objects to the internet says it is struggling to meet its growth targets due to high expectations for alternative forthcoming services
the company whose shareholders include french oil major total and group missed its revenue target last year ceo ludovic le moan told reuters on wednesday but it still sees good prospects for its technology and aims to break even in the fourth quarter of this year
if it reaches that target it could seek a stock market listing le moan said in an interview
sigfox seeks to tap into the burgeoning internet of things iot sector where it faces competition from two other emerging networks lora backed by french telecom operator orange and equipment maker cisco systems and which is backed by japan s softbank
these three companies wireless networks enable devices to transfer small volumes of data over a wide area while maintaining battery life over many years whereas services can carry much bigger volumes but cost a lot more
there s a lot of noise around these days le moan said
but these technologies that are being put in place are much more costly he added
for telecom players this is all about generating new the first standards for the next generation of broadband mobile internet were recently approved with first commercial offers expected in or
the for will cost billions of euros for each national market compared with a few million for sigfox s iot networks le moan said
objects connected through sigfox s networks range from house alarms to public waste containers and water metres
set up in the company generated revenues of million euros in up from million in but million short of its initial target le moan said
higher volume usage of iot chips such as those made by stmicroelectronics or texas instruments will help drive down the cost of iot chips to a few cents per unit making the technology more attractive he said
sigfox which has raised more million euros over the last seven years and has staff currently has million connected objects on its networks le moan said
