pegas trading platform keen to introduce temperature products
frankfurt feb reuters european gas trading platform pegas said it is developing temperature products which if approved could go live next year and help energy operators hedge weather risks
a final plan will be presented to the exchange s top management in the third quarter sirko beidatsch a natural gas expert at pegas said
there is a lot of interest from traders and utilities and their customers were seeking more standardisation and transparency in a market so far dominated by reinsurers beidatsch said
pegas operated by french energy bourse powernext which is a subsidiary of deutsche boerse s eex group presented plans during an energy trade fair in essen last week for two purely futures contracts and for two tailored to gas buyers and consumers he said
the latter entail one physically delivered volume hedge which tracks the difference between temperatures and standardised gas consumer contracts and a financial swap contract that would reflect the difference between temperatures and gas prices
pegas offers spot and futures for major european gas hubs as well as trading location spread and time spread products for much of continental europe and britain
weather conditions influence gas prices heavily and hence the likely income and losses for for example municipalities delivering heat to households and industry
