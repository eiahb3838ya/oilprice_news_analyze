update 1-france's rte keen for role in eu power grid consolidation
paris reuters french grid operator rte would be keen to play a part in european union power grid consolidation and in favour of changing its legal status in order to achieve that its chief executive said on wednesday
the largest grid operator in europe rte is majority owned by french utility edf but it remains a purely national player in an industry where more and more grid operators have stakes in foreign grids
rte is not meant to be merely an observer in the consolidation of the european power grid industry rte chief executive francois brottes told reporters
most european power grids were split off from the utilities that owned them more than a decade ago in a process called unbundling that was supposed to give all power producers equal access to the networks
but rte remains one of a few independent transmission operators itos still owned by vertically integrated utilities
there are just eight itos among europe s grid operators and these itos are not allowed to buy stakes in unbundled independent power grid operators
but brottes said he would be in favour of changing rte s ito status to be able to take part in any power grid consolidation
i personally think we should get out of it he said
brottes who met energy sector reporters said that he agreed that not much could happen in terms of major grid operator consolidation in europe as long as a key player like rte remains an ito
we can only court other itos we can not try to seduce other companies he said
brottes said the european grid industry is consolidating right now and that therefore rte needs to reconsider its business model
in rte had prepared a bid for greek grid operator admie one of the few other european grid operators with the ito status but it was outbid by the state grid corporation of china of china corporation sgcc which paid million euros for a percent stake
sgcc also bought stakes in grid operators in portugal and italy in recent years
the chinese are already in portugal and italy and in germany they are negotiating now

the chinese want to buy everything that is for sale brottes said
brottes said its status as a regulated company charging tariffs also made it harder to bid for foreign peers
we are not an investment fund we can not put a bag of dollars on the table our regulator would challenge that he said
