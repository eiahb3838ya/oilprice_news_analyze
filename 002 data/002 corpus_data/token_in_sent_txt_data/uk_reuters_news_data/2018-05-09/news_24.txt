analysis-cracks in british nuclear reactor ring power alarm bells
london reuters cracks in the core of a scottish nuclear reactor could signal that most of britain s ageing plants will not be able to supply the country with much needed power for as long as predicted
nuclear reactors generate just over percent of britain s electricity and even before edf energy said last week it would need to shut down one of two reactors at the hunterston b plant almost half of that capacity was scheduled to go offline by
these reactors are over years old
this is a generic defect which can not be fixed so it would not surprise me if the older plants would all need to close within the next few years said john large an independent nuclear engineering consultant
britain s electricity generation is under scrutiny due to a plan to close power plants by and weak economic conditions for investment in new gas plants
there are also doubts about the timetable for edf s hinkley point c nuclear plant which is not expected to come online until the end of and the proposed sizewell c plant which is not even being built yet
french utility edf said the hunterston b shutdown was due to new cracks developing faster than expected in graphite bricks in one reactor s core
these bricks are used in all advanced nuclear reactors agrs in britain which drive seven out of eight of the country s plants
we believe that most of the agrs will have their life limited by the progression of cracking britain s office for nuclear regulation onr says on its website adding that this presents unique challenges
the bricks can not be repaired or replaced and edf says it will work with the onr to show there would be no danger posed even in the event of an earthquake or other disruption
the safety case will build on work already completed and edf energy expects that this will demonstrate that there are large safety margins both now and for the projected reactor lifetime edf energy said
edf has not changed its lifetime forecasts for hunterston b which is due to be decommissioned in although it predicts the reactor will remain shut until
but experts such as large whose consultancy large and associates has worked for britain s atomic energy authority and environmental group greenpeace says this is over optimistic
the graphite bricks form channels which contain nuclear fuel and the reactor control rods while allowing carbon dioxide coolant to remove heat from the reactor fuel and core
they crack with age but can not be replaced due to their location
britain s onr says the properties of the bricks change over time due to interaction with radiation and the reactor coolant
there are around graphite bricks in each reactor core which are bound by steel and contained in a concrete pressure vessel which is over three metres thick
control rods are inserted through channels in the core to control the reaction and also used to shut down the reactor
keyway root cracking as found at hunterston b is caused by tension in the graphite at the outer surface of the bricks due to changes in their internal stress
this can then progressively crack many bricks across the core
john loughhead chief scientific adviser to the uk government s department for business energy and industrial strategy said the have grown a little more quickly than projected and edf energy will now be working to understand how to make prediction of future growth more accurate
these reactors are in the later stages of their life but it is too early to be getting worried that this is the beginning of the end he added
hunterston b and hinkley point b are britain s oldest nuclear plants each with two reactors commissioned in
one of hinkley point b s two reactors is also offline for a scheduled outage during which routine inspections of the graphite will also take place
reactors at two of edf energy s other plants in britain heysham and hartlepool were taken offline in after cracks on a boiler spine were found at one of them caused by high operating temperatures
in france edf s nuclear plants provide up to percent of the country s power needs but the fleet has been dogged by repeated shutdowns and inspections over the integrity of some components
elsewhere in europe belgium s regulator ordered production to be stopped at two nuclear reactors not operated by edf in after finding indications of tiny cracks in core tanks
edf energy said the shutdown at the hunterston b reactor would result in a forecast reduction of terrawatt hours in its total nuclear output for this year
based on current uk baseload power prices that could equate to a loss of around million pounds
the firm also says it has spent more than million pounds in the last five years on graphite research
the thing which will close these reactors down in the end will be the cost of ensuring safety
it is possible to make a safety case for a significant amount of cracked bricks but it takes time and costs money said barry marsden professor of nuclear graphite technology at the university of manchester
