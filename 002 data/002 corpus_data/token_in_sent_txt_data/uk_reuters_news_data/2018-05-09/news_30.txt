interview-"no follow up" from trump over staying in climate pact-un
bonn germany reuters president donald trump has yet to outline what changes he wants in a global climate agreement as the price for dropping his plan to quit the united nations climate chief said on wednesday
patricia espinosa said she had asked washington for its demands after trump announced last june that he planned to quit the landmark paris agreement which aims to end the fossil fuel era this century with a shift to cleaner energies
there has not been a from washington she told reuters during negotiations in bonn among almost nations on a rule book for the agreement
espinosa a former mexican foreign minister who leads the
climate change secretariat said she had stressed that the pact was flexible allowing all countries to set their own targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
i would not like to see the leaving
i certainly hope there is a reconsideration of this decision she said of trump s plan to pull out
trump doubts the view of mainstream science that greenhouse gases are raising global temperatures
the rules of the paris agreement mean that trump can not formally pull out before november around the time of the next presidential election
in announcing the withdrawal trump said paris was a bad deal that would harm the economy but added we will see if we can make a deal that s fair
and if we can that s great
and if we can t that s espinosa said that trump s plan to quit the iran nuclear deal announced on tuesday and again demonstrating that he is willing to defy pleas from allies did not dim her hopes that washington might stay in the paris accord
i think these are completely separate spheres of foreign policy and decision making she said
on climate change she said trump might be swayed by an accelerating shift among many states cities and companies to cleaner energies from fossil fuels
asked if the united states would outline its demands at the bonn talks a state department official said we do not have any new information to share at this time on decisions concerning the paris the bonn meeting which ends on thursday is working on rules for the paris agreement due to be in place by the end of the year such as how to measure and account for greenhouse gas emissions and climate finance for developing nations that is meant to reach billion a year by
a good set of rules should be a way to give comfort and confidence to the concerns they the united states could have said espinosa
asked if she would be happy for the united states to stay while watering down deep cuts in emissions promised by former president barack obama espinosa said i think we should not choose between those two reporting by alister doyle editing by gareth jones
