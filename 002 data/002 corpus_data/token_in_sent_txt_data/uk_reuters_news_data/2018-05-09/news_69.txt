fear, loathing and dismay in iran as trump exits nuclear deal
jubilation gives way to gloom as renewed sanctions loom iranians fear greater hostility from administration deep frustrations over economic hardship by parisa hafezi ankara may reuters morad sabzevari was among thousands of jubilant iranians who took to the streets to celebrate a nuclear deal with major powers in
he expected it to end his country s isolation and even bring prosperity one day
sabzevari s hopes were dashed on tuesday when president donald trump announced the united states was withdrawing from a horrible deal and reimposing sanctions on iran
his tone rattled sabzevari a school teacher in central city of isfahan criticised iranian president hassan rouhani a pragmatist who overcame fierce opposition from hardliners to secure the deal
i am scared
i listened to trump s speech on english news channels last night
it was a declaration of war against iran
it means pressure
it means dark days and months are ahead of us sabzevari said by telephone
what should i do
i have two children
president you the nuclear pact designed to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb was thrashed out by the united states five other world powers and iran and traded a lifting of sanctions in exchange for curbs on tehran s nuclear program
trump said the accord the signature foreign policy achievement of his predecessor barack obama failed to address iran s ballistic missile program its nuclear activities beyond and its role in conflicts in the middle east where it is involved in proxy wars with ally saudi arabia
rouhani has sought to reassure ordinary iranians already deeply frustrated by high unemployment and low living standards that iran s economy could withstand a return to the economic pressures that will follow trump s decision
but fariba saravi phd student at tehran azad university was pessimistic
i am tired of empty words promises lies trump s message was clear
we will be squeezed
we will be isolated again but this time with a crazy person like trump it will be worse than before the deal she said
iran s economy has continued to struggle despite the easing of sanctions from
average unemployment of percent rises close to percent among iran s restless youth more than percent of iran s million population are aged to
in late december iranians staged nationwide demonstrations over poor living standards calling on rouhani as well as top clerical leaders to step down
for many the picture looks even grimmer after trump s decision and there is a risk the deal will collapse entirely even though european signatories are trying to hold it together
you know what
they did not have money to pay our salaries
now it will be even worse god help us said factory worker mostafa in the northern city of noshahr
i have not got my wage in the past two months
rouhani promised more jobs but now i will be pressure will mount on the iranian leadership when restrictions cut its oil exports that are the engine of iran s economy raising the prospect of further unrest
why should foreigners invest in iran when we are trying to move our businesses to another country said a businessman who asked not to be named in the holy shi ite city of mashhad
i am in the dried fruit export business
since last night i have been seriously thinking of moving to a neighbouring country like more iranians could come to the same conclusion as sanctions bite
many foreign firms have shunned iran in part due to the remaining sanctions unilaterally imposed by the united states over what it says are human rights violations terrorism and the dominant role of the revolutionary guard corps irgc in iran s economy
younger particularly urban iranians have wider concerns as their country is squeezed economically
i don t care what politicians do
they are all liars
but now i almost have no hope for more freedoms social cultural and even political said garshasb amini in the central city of yazd
rouhani a longtime establishment insider who won the presidency in and was bolstered by the support of many iranians yearning for freedoms
but rights groups say there has been little if any progress
rouhani and his allies say hardliners who dominate the judiciary and security services are a roadblock to more freedoms at home
maryam saberi who lives in tehran s affluent zaferaniyeh neighbourhood has more pressing concerns
i could not sleep last night
i am so scared of iran being attacked by israel
i remember when iraq bombed tehran during the war i don t care about the nuclear programme
i just want my country to be safe she said
hardliners are putting their faith in iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei who in iran s complex power structure has the final say on matters of state
i don t care what trump does
my beloved khamenei will lead us out of this as he has done in the past said gholamreza ashtiani a member of iran s volunteer basij militia in the holy city of qom
death to america
death to israel he said
