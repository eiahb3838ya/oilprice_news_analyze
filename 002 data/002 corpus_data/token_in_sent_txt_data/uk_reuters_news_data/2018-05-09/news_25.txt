in 1990s redux, eu to consider blocking u.s. sanctions over iran
brussels reuters in when the united states tried to penalise foreign companies trading with cuba the european union forced washington to back down by threatening retaliatory sanctions
two decades later the european union is being driven to threaten such measures again over iran and this time may follow through after president donald trump withdrew from the nuclear pact between iran and world powers and reimposed an array of wide sanctions on the islamic republic
this left dismayed european allies scrambling to salvage the international nuclear pact as tehran said trump had made a mistake and proved washington could not be trusted
the eu s blocking statute is the most powerful tool at its immediate disposal because it bans any eu company from complying with sanctions and does not recognise any court rulings that enforce american penalties
but it has never been used and is seen by european governments more as a political weapon than a regulation because its rules are vague and difficult to enforce serving mainly as a warning to the united states
the international reach of the financial system and the presence of many european companies also raise questions about its effectiveness
it is a technical tool that worked with president bill clinton because it was coupled with a political strategy said one senior eu source involved in iran negotiations referring to clinton s decision to waive sanctions on eu companies related to cuba iran and libya
eu officials say they are revamping the blocking statute to encompass trump s may decision to revive sanctions after the expiry of and periods including sanctions aimed at iran s lifeblood oil sector and transactions with its central bank
the blocking statute is one of the main options it s being updated to make it ready said a second senior eu official
european commissioners are expected to decide whether to go ahead next week in brussels setting the stage for eu government leaders to take a final decision at a summit in sofia on may
but diplomats say it will be difficult to gain the agreement of all eu states
the blocking statute threat has less weight than in clinton s era because sanctions targeting financial transactions have become more robust and costly for eu firms
european companies with big operations in the united states such as shell are pressuring their governments instead to pursue waivers on a basis
europeans are most worried about how to sustain incentives for iran to stick to the groundbreaking accord signed by world powers in july which lifted international sanctions on iran in in return for tehran shutting down its capacity under strict surveillance by the nuclear watchdog to stockpile enriched uranium for a possible atomic bomb
trump denounced the accord completed under his predecessor barack obama as a horrible deal that should have never ever been made as it did not cover iran s ballistic missile programme or its role in middle east conflicts
the deal s proponents say it is crucial to forestalling a nuclear iran and preventing wider war in the middle east
the issue of incentives to keep iran in the deal is completely absent from thinking
in meeting with diplomats it s all about confrontation and isolation of tehran another official said
without the carrot of economic benefits the eu worries it will also lose influence over iran
once iran s top trading partner and its oil customer the eu has sought to pour hundreds of billions of euros into the islamic republic since the bloc along with the united nations and united states lifted blanket economic sanctions in that had lamed the iranian economy
iran s exports of mainly fuel and other energy products to the eu in jumped percent to billion euros billion compared with the previous year while investment in iran jumped to more than billion euros
european energy commissioner miguel arias canete will meet iranian officials in tehran during a trip from may to try to reassure iran and strengthen energy relations
other eu measures to try to keep eu money flowing into iran include coordinating and increasing eu governments export guarantee credits
that could allow more loans as well as free the european investment bank to invest in iran for the first time
for its part italy has signed a framework credit agreement with iran to fund investments worth up to billion euros for projects carried out jointly by italian and iranian companies
france is considering a similar agreement
