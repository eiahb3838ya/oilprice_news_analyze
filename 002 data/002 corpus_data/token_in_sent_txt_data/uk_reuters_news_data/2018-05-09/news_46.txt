interview-syrah resources targets ev battery market with mozambique graphite mine
graphite demand seen rising for ev battery market balama project will cut into chinese dominance by ed stoddard johannesburg may reuters syrah resources is targeting the market for electric vehicle batteries with its balama graphite mine in mozambique which started production in november
a global scramble is on for commodities such as graphite cobalt and lithium which are among the key components in the rechargeable batteries used to power mobile devices and electric vehicles
the growth market and our focus in the coming years is very much in the battery segment syrah chief executive shaun verner told reuters in a telephone interview
verner said syrah saw the market for graphite more than doubling over the next eight years to million tonnes from tonnes currently with the battery industry accounting for the bulk of that demand
currently battery demand is about tonnes or around percent of the market
about percent of our production is the smaller flake in demand in the battery sector verner said
capacity for the balama mine and plant is tonnes annually and the company is looking at to tonnes in the first year reaching full production in three years and cutting into the dominance of china where percent of global supply currently originates
by it will be providing to percent of global supply if current projections remain on target
in our first four months of operation we have exported to countries across asia verner said with most going to china japan and south korea
in europe germany has been the biggest consumer
the resource is close to the surface and easy to access
the graphite is exported through the port of nacala taken there by road on a km mile journey from the mine in the interior of northern mozambique
south africa s grinrod has a logistics contract to provide road transport and warehousing
infrastructure challenges in the southern african country which is extremely poor and underdeveloped have stymied the growth of its coal sector
mozambique also has huge offshore gas reserves that are being brought to commercial production
parts of mozambique s remote north and central regions have been hit in recent years by security incidents and banditry but verner said the project had not been impacted
we have not seen any security concerns right through the period from exploration to construction and now into operations he said
