update 4-saudi arabia will not act alone to fill any iran oil shortfall - opec source
riyadh can offset oil disruption after us quits iran deal will not produce more oil consulting with uae russia over market situation too early to assess impact of sanctions on iran oil adds breakingviews link by rania el gamal dubai may reuters saudi arabia is monitoring the impact of the withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal on oil supplies and is ready to offset any shortage but it will not act alone to fill the gap an opec source familiar with the kingdom s oil thinking said
president donald trump on tuesday abandoned a nuclear deal with iran and announced the highest level of sanctions against the opec member
the original agreement had lifted sanctions in exchange for tehran limiting its nuclear programme
iran is the oil producer in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries after saudi arabia and iraq
during the last round of sanctions iran s oil supplies fell by around million barrels per day bpd but the country as a major oil exporter especially to refiners in asia after sanctions were lifted in january
people shouldn t take it for granted that saudi arabia will produce more oil
we need to assess first the impact if there is any in terms of disruption in terms of a reduction of iran s production the opec source said on wednesday
we have managed to put together this new alliance between opec and
saudi arabia will not in any way act independently of its riyadh is working closely with the united arab emirates uae which holds opec s presidency in and producer russia for coordination and market consultations the opec source said
he said any action would be taken in coordination with all opec and partners if needed
opec s oil deal with producers such as russia has helped to clear a global oil supply glut and boost prices
the agreement is due to expire at the end of
opec officials from saudi arabia the uae and russia along with few other producers in the pact are due to meet in saudi arabia on may as part of a monthly meeting for the joint technical committee which monitors the oil market
saudi arabia the world s largest oil exporter and top opec producer is concerned about any negative impact from the potential oil supply shortage for countries the opec source said
but saudi arabia has enough oil production capacity currently at million barrels per day bpd to maintain oil market stability the opec source also said
iran produces about million bpd
since the iran nuclear deal went into effect its exports have risen to about million bpd from less than million bpd
a majority goes to asia with europe receiving about bpd
analysts now expect iran s supplies to fall by between bpd and million bpd depending on how many other countries fall in line with washington
expectations that new sanctions could hit iranian crude exports and feed tensions in the middle east had pushed oil prices higher in the past few weeks
brent crude was trading about at a year high on wednesday raising concerns that prices were going too high too fast
trump accused opec last month of artificially boosting oil prices in a message on twitter the first time he has mentioned opec on social media
his tweet was seen by opec sources as the president s way to appease a domestic audience unhappy about a rise in gasoline prices
a key ally saudi arabia welcomed trump s decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with iran and to reimpose economic sanctions
riyadh also said it would work with opec and to lessen the impact of oil shortages in a clear indication that the country has been coordinating with washington ahead of time sources familiar with the matter said
you need to work with your partners in dealing with any potential effect on supply the opec source said
but it should be done in a collective coordinated way and that can only happen when you start to be able to assess what would be the opec and meet next in june and they are widely expected to keep supply curbs in place until the end of
but a drop in iranian exports due to sanctions plus supply disruptions in other opec members such as venezuela could reduce supply more than planned leading to a potential price spike
but the opec source said a rise in prices due to the market s worries about supply should not be the parameter for opec to adjust output
the opec source said any decision in june to raise output should be driven by a potential physical shortage or reduction in production from any oil supply source not only you only handle output when you have a idea of what would be the potential impact
it is too early now to do that the source said
he also said saudi arabia does not expect any physical impact on the oil market from the iran sanctions until the third or fourth quarter of this year
opec s objective its still to reduce global oil inventories to an acceptable level and any adjustment in production targets should be done in a coordinated way the opec source said
this way you do not disrupt a mechanism that we have worked hard to put together and to sustain just to address a issue the source said
