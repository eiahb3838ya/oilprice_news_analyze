adds comments from diplomats officials poll horrible deal says trump iran says trump s move is illegal america s european allies concerned israel saudi arabia welcome trump decision pullout could stoke middle east conflicts by steve holland and yara bayoumy washington may reuters president donald trump on tuesday pulled the united states out of an international nuclear deal with iran raising the risk of conflict in the middle east upsetting european allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies
trump said in a televised address from the white house that he would reimpose economic sanctions on iran to undermine a horrible deal that should have never ever been the agreement worked out by the united states five other world powers and iran lifted sanctions on iran in exchange for tehran limiting its nuclear program
the pact was designed to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb
but trump complained that the accord the signature foreign policy achievement of his democratic predecessor barack obama did not address iran s ballistic missile program its nuclear activities beyond or its role in conflicts in yemen and syria
trump s decision intensifies the strain on the alliance since he took office months ago
one by one european leaders came to washington and tried to meet his demands while pleading with him to preserve the deal
by the middle of last week however it was becoming increasingly clear to some diplomats that trump would not be moved
we felt like we were going through the motions said a person close to the negotiations
even trump s top aides had not been seeking aggressively to talk trump out of withdrawing because his mind had been made up a white house official said
the trump administration kept the door open to negotiating another deal with allies but it is far from clear if the europeans would go for that and if they could convince iran to accept it
the leaders of britain germany and france which were signatories to the deal along with china and russia said in a joint statement that trump s decision was a cause for regret and a western diplomat was more pointed
it announces sanctions for which the first victims will be trump s european allies the diplomat said adding that it was clear trump did not care about the alliance
abandoning the iran pact was one of the most consequential decisions of trump s america first policy which has led him to withdraw the united states from the paris climate accord come close to a trade war with china and pull out of an trade deal
it also appeared to reflect the growing influence within the administration of iran hawks like new secretary of state mike pompeo and national security adviser john bolton
both favored getting out of the deal but did not need to press their case as trump had already made up his mind a senior white house official said
trump had reluctantly been granting iran sanctions relief every few months and by middle of was already furious at aides for trying to persuade him to stay in the deal a source said
bolton told reporters on tuesday that trump did not withdraw from the agreement until now because he gave repeated opportunities to try to fix the iranian president hassan rouhani said on tuesday that iran would remain in the deal without washington
nevertheless trump s decision to exit the deal could tip the balance of power in favor of hardliners looking to constrain rouhani s ability to open up to the west
iran denies it has tried to build atomic weapons and says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes
inspectors say iran has not broken the nuclear deal and senior officials themselves have said several times that iran is in technical compliance with the pact
iranian state television said trump s decision to withdraw was illegal illegitimate and undermines international renewing sanctions would make it much harder for iran to sell its oil abroad or use the international banking system
iran is the member of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and pumps about million barrels per day of crude or just under percent of global supply
china india japan and south korea buy most of its million bpd of exports
according to the treasury sanctions related to iran s energy auto and financial sectors will be reimposed in three and six months

licenses for boeing co and airbus to sell passenger jets to iran will be revoked treasury secretary steve mnuchin said scuttling a billion deal
trump said the nuclear agreement did not prevent iran from cheating and continuing to pursue nuclear weapons
it is clear to me that we can not prevent an iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement he said
the iran deal is defective at its less than one in three americans agrees with trump s decision to pull the united states out of the deal according to a national opinion poll released on tuesday
the poll conducted may ahead of the republican president s announcement to end the deal found that percent of adults wanted to end it while percent said the united states should remain in and the remaining percent said they don t trump said he was willing to negotiate a new deal with iran but tehran already has ruled that out and threatened unspecified retaliation if washington pulled out
