iran deal withdrawal, other global issues risk higher oil prices - goldman sachs
may reuters oil prices are at risk for further gains due to the united states decision to withdraw from the iran nuclear agreement coupled with rising tensions in other countries such as saudi arabia and venezuela goldman sachs said in a note wednesday
the investment bank s current forecast is for brent crude to hit a barrel by the summer it is currently trading around a barrel
the harsher approach by the united states could result in an initial loss of about barrels a day bpd in iran s output which is currently million bpd
such a loss would boost oil prices by about per barrel goldman said
such elevated oil geopolitical risks exacerbate the upside risks to brent forecasts and reinforce our view that oil price volatility will continue to increase they wrote
