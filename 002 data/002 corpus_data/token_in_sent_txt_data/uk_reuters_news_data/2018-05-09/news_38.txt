update 1-britain plays down media report of hitachi nuclear deal
reuters britain s government on wednesday played down a media report that it will guarantee hitachi ltd s horizon nuclear power loans for the construction of two reactors in wales
british prime minister theresa may met hitachi chairman hiroaki nakanishi last week in london and asked him to go ahead with the project conveying the government s intention to fully guarantee the loans japan s mainichi newspaper paper said without citing a source
we don t recognise these reports a spokesman for britain s department for business energy and industrial strategy beis said in an emailed statement
nuclear power remains a crucial part of the uk s energy future but we have always been clear that this must be delivered at the right price for consumers and taxpayers he said
britain is seeking new ways to fund nuclear projects after criticism over a deal awarded to france s edf to build the first nuclear plant in britain for years which could cost consumers billion pounds
these discussions are commercially sensitive and we have no further details at this time the beis spokesman said
hitachi s horizon plans to construct at least gigawatts of new nuclear capacity at two sites in britain the first at wylfa newydd in wales and a second at in england
horizon said the two projects could generate enough electricity to power million homes and create tens of thousands of jobs
there are regular and ongoing discussions between ourselves and the uk government on the project but we will not comment on the specifics in terms of the participants in or content of the conversations a spokesman for horizon said
the mainichi report said hitachi is still pushing for the british government to take a stake in the project and guarantee electricity prices to ensure it is profitable
the cost of the hitachi project in wales has ballooned to trillion yen billion pounds due to tougher safety measures the newspaper said
hitachi declined to comment when contacted by reuters
