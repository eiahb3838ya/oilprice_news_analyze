london reuters algeria s state energy firm sonatrach plans to buy exxonmobil s augusta refinery in sicily italy the companies said on wednesday as the north african oil producer seeks to cut its hefty fuel bills
algeria which needs to meet surging domestic fuel demand paid million for fuel imports in but that more than tripled in to a record billion because of refining problems
exxon s italian subsidiary said the deal included three fuel storage terminals and related pipelines in augusta palermo and naples and the transaction was expected to close at the end of
financial terms were not disclosed
the deal would be sonatrach s first overseas acquisition reflecting a more flexible and open approach under ceo abdelmoumen ould kaddour
the augusta refinery is able to process sahara blend and residual fuel from algeria s skikda plant and will be directly integrated into sonatrach s refinery system the algerian company said in a statement
it will also be able to process directly products that are surplus in algeria in order to products that are in deficit like diesel and petrol sonatrach said
ould kaddour said sicily made sense geographically and because of possible synergies with skikda refinery
we are extremely proud to make our first investment in international refining in italy ould kaddour said
ould kaddour also told french news outlet les echos that sonatrach was about to sign a deal with french oil company total to build a petrochemical plant in algeria
it will be the first unit to produce propylene and polypropylene in algeria most of it will be exported to europe ould kaddour told les echos
a spokesman for total declined to comment
algeria has struggled to attract foreign investment in recent years and has seen its oil and gas production stagnate
since ould kaddour took the helm of sonatrach in march last year he has been trying to make sonatrach s culture more and resolve legal disputes with foreign companies
sonatrach said in january it had signed a crude for refined products deal with the world s largest oil trader vitol to cut its fuel bills the first deal of its kind in decades
it also said it was looking to invest in a foreign refinery
