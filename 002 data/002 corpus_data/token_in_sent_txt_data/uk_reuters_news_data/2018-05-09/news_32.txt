bats have hung around for 33 million years, fossil shows
brussels reuters belgian scientists have discovered the oldest ever fossil of the common bat proving the species already existed more than million years ago
the bones of the tiny mammal were found at a fossil site in the late unearthed when a new train track was built east of brussels but researchers spent decades sifting through tonnes of soil to make the discovery
eventually they encountered the bones of a tiny bat from the myotis or bat genus barely changed from those commonly found in europe today
this fossil bat is tiny it is only made up of tiny isolated teeth fragments of the jaw and some small bones said thierry smith one of the researchers involved in the project at the royal institute of natural sciences
some species survive a few thousand years or one or two million years but not like here million years he added
the belgian discovery shows that the previous estimate of when such bats appeared for the first time was off by some seven million years
smith said the long life of the bat species could be explained by the fact that bats are the only mammal capable of flying and as such did not need to compete with others for resources
