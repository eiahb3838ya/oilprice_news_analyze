yerevan reuters armenia s newly elected prime minister nikol pashinyan said on wednesday he would meet russian president vladimir putin next week on the sidelines of a summit of the economic union summit in the black sea resort of sochi
opposition leader pashinyan was elected prime minister by armenia s parliament on tuesday capping a peaceful revolution driven by weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism
after being installed as prime minister pashinyan said he hoped to meet putin for talks soon
the kremlin said putin had sent pashinyan a telegram congratulating him on his appointment
it s confirmed now that i ll meet putin on may in sochi and we will continue discussions which we ve started during a telephone conversation pashinyan said in a video posted on his facebook page
the post was recorded in a helicopter on his way back to yerevan from a mountainous part of azerbaijan run by ethnic armenians who declared independence from baku during a conflict that erupted as the soviet union crumbled in
moscow which has a military base in armenia is wary of an uncontrolled change of power which would pull the country out of its orbit but pashinyan has offered assurances that he will not break with the kremlin
