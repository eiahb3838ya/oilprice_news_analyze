update 1-edf q1 sales up 3.7 pct as nuclear reactors back on line
paris reuters electric power utility edf said improved availability of its french nuclear power stations and higher tariffs boosted sales by percent to billion euros
chief financial officer xavier girre told analysts that edf expects the french state council to decide on regulated power tariffs in coming weeks after an adviser to the council last week recommended scrapping the tariffs under which edf sells power to most of its clients
he declined to comment on the possible impact for edf
a decade after the french power market was opened to competition edf still sells about percent of all electricity in france with competitors such as direct energie trying to woo clients with offers
the scrapping of regulated tariffs could speed up the client exodus at edf which lost nearly million customers last year
edf said nuclear electricity production in france rose percent to twh in line with its forecast for nuclear output greater than twh in as nearly all its reactors are now back on line following a series of outages last year
the company also confirmed its earnings guidance for core earnings of to billion euros and cash flow that is slightly positive or close to balance excluding investments in its linky smart meters and asset disposals
sales from french generation and supply were up percent to billion euros sales from regulated activities up percent to billion euros uk sales up percent to billion euros and sales in italy were up percent to billion euros
edf also for the first time detailed the revenues of its dalkia energy services unit and its edf energies nouvelles unit which had revenues of billion euros and million euros respectively
while overall sales were up percent from a restated billion euros in they were down percent compared to the billion euro revenue published a year ago
girre said new accounting rules no longer allow edf to recognise the delivery component of energy supply contracts and some market trading activities as revenue
the revenue reduction is offset by a similar reduction in fuel and energy purchases and will have no impact on core earnings he added
