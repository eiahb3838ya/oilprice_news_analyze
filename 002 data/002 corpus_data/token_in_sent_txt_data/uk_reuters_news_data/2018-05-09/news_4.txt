europe licks wounds as saudi arabia and israel hail trump on iran
trump pulls out of iran nuclear deal europeans failed to persuade trump to stay in saudi arabia israel hail trump s decision saudi and israeli leaders had visited nuclear facilities by john irish rania el gamal and steve holland may reuters when saudi arabia s crown prince visited france in april he oozed confidence that president donald trump would pull the united states out of the iran nuclear deal which riyadh has long opposed
answering reporters questions in paris two weeks after talks with trump in washington prince mohammed bin salman compared the deal to the munich agreement which was meant by european powers to appease nazi germany but ended in war
where french german and british diplomatic efforts failed with trump saudi arabia s appear to have succeeded
a source close to saudi policymakers said washington and riyadh iran s main regional rival had been discussing the nuclear deal for some time before trump announced on tuesday that the united states was pulling out of it
the source said it was obvious from the crown prince s talks with trump in the white house on march and a visit to riyadh a month later by secretary of state mike pompeo that there had been a coordination of positions
we were for it and we worked on it another saudi source said of riyadh s diplomacy
also celebrating is israel another of iran s enemies
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu unveiled what he said was evidence of a secret iranian nuclear weapons programme on april
most of the purported evidence netanyahu presented dated to the period before the accord was signed although he said iran had also kept important files on nuclear technology since then and continued adding to its nuclear weapons knowledge
tehran dismissed netanyahu as the boy who cried wolf and called his presentation propaganda
although israeli officials said they did not know whether trump had been swayed by the information the president referred to it in his announcement on tuesday
netanyahu had talks with trump in the white house in march and israeli diplomats worked hard behind the scenes to get their country s views across on the deal intended to prevent tehran obtaining a nuclear bomb but seen by opponents as flawed
asked how much of the israeli ambassador to washington s time had been spent arguing the case against the deal deputy minister for diplomacy michael oren told reuters guess
something in the vicinity of percent
this issue is for netanyahu trump s announcement was a blow to french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel
both tried to change trump s mind on iran during visits to the white house in april and both failed
british foreign secretary boris johnson also made a dash to washington but did not get to see the president
he put britain s case at talks with pompeo and in an interview with fox friends on cable channel fox news which trump regularly watches
despite their efforts european leaders knew by that the chances of persuading trump to stay in the nuclear deal were fading european diplomats said
macron s visit was the last resort a european official told reuters in brussels referring to the french leader s talks with trump in the white house on april
describing the last month of diplomacy as disastrous the official said for weeks all the indications from the white house and state department were he s out of the deal on wednesday the european allies were seeking to salvage the nuclear deal and preserve their business with iran
trump s message to the europeans in the to his announcement was that they must come up with a way to toughen the nuclear deal if the united states was to remain in it said sources familiar with the discussions
he pressed for a separate deal to go alongside the nuclear agreement that would address other concerns about iran such as its ballistic missile program which was not covered in the accord they said
progress was made in the negotiations but not enough to sway trump
the sources familiar with the debate said trump wanted a separate agreement with the other main signatories of the original deal france britain germany china and russia
but berlin said the agreement would have to be submitted to a european union body for approval and this appeared to stall the effort they said
pompeo told the german and british foreign ministers and a senior french official by telephone last friday that washington would no longer pursue the process with europe
the european and positions were too far apart on the sunset clauses allowing for some restriction on iran s nuclear enrichment programme to be lifted
by midway through last week european diplomats felt like we were going through the motions a european official said
some european diplomats believed any chance of persuading trump to stay in the deal had gone even before macron visited washington
they saw pompeo s appointment in march as a deadly blow and it was quickly followed by the arrival in the white house of john bolton another iran hawk as national security adviser
rex tillerson the previous secretary of state had seen value in staying in the deal as did defense secretary james mattis
the president reluctantly agreed to give the deal more time in april when an initial renewal deadline approached
but by the next deadline last july trump was furious at aides for trying to persuade him to stay in the deal a source familiar with the debate said
you mean you had three months and you didn t do anything he told them the source said
in october trump announced he would not permit certification of iranian compliance with the deal setting the united states on the path that it reached on tuesday
a white house official said that in the days leading up to the president s announcement top aides had not been seeking aggressively to talk trump out of withdrawing because his mind had been made up
by then european officials were despondent a european diplomat said
we realised we have to buy time
on the eve of the trump decision all we could do is to tell the iranians don t do anything rash the diplomat said
