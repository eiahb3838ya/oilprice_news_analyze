update 1-eu defence of iran deal brings companies little relief
reuters european governments vowed on wednesday to try to shield their improved economic ties with iran from the impact of renewed sanctions but business leaders struck a more pessimistic note
the eu said it remained committed to the iran nuclear deal and the suspension of its own sanctions the day after president donald trump announced washington s withdrawal from the pact
french foreign minister le drian also insisted the deal was not dead

siemens is still assessing the implications of the iran decision the german industrial giant s chief financial officer ralf thomas told reporters on a call
one of the strongest industrialised countries in the world has made a political decision as an industrial company we have to recognise that thomas said
existing projects will be completed as far as legally possible he added
trump s move will lead to the reimposition of penalties that were waived under the nuclear deal including financial sanctions that had made it extremely difficult for global companies to do business with or in iran
companies worst affected are likely to include plane manufacturer airbus peugeot maker psa group and its fellow french automaker renault

psa which sold vehicles in iran last year called on the european union to maintain a united front in defence of the nuclear agreement
germany s bdi industry association also said the eu russia and china should commit clearly to the deal after washington s new ambassador ruffled feathers by tweeting german companies doing business in iran should wind down operations the nuclear detente had sparked great hopes for the opening of the iranian market bdi head dieter kempf said

earlier this year we decided to phase out and exit all activities to and from iran and suspend our existing relations with austria s oberbank decided last november not to provide financing to iranian counterparts due to the constantly changing political framework a spokesman said
germany s hermes export guarantee scheme for iran remains in place for the time being the country s economy ministry said
but france s export finance programme which had been due to launch in has been put on hold in recent weeks pending trump s decision several french officials told reuters
export finance is still being discussed an elysee official said but it s not necessarily that simple
the bpifrance sovereign fund which was due to administer the scheme declined to comment
french officials will be focused on helping companies exit iran within the periods said one or on seeking unlikely waivers or assurances for activities they want to pursue beyond the deadlines
companies will have to choose between their iranian economic interests and their potential interests said a senior diplomat
