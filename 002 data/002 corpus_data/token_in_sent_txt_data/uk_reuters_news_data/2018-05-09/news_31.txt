factbox-hezbollah and allies emerge stronger from lebanon vote
beirut reuters the heavily armed shi ite movement hezbollah together with groups and individuals that are politically aligned to it won at least of parliament s seats in an election on sunday
the result is a boost for the group which declared it a victory for the choice of the resistance a reference to its powerful arsenal that has been a major point of contention in lebanon for years
differences and in some cases conflict between some parties in the camp means it does not operate with unified goals in domestic politics and hezbollah does not see eye to eye with its allies on all issues
but for hezbollah it has been politically vital to have their support for its possession of arms which it says are needed to deter israel and in more recent years to protect lebanon from islamist insurgents in syria
here is the breakdown hezbollah seats founded in by iran s revolutionary guards and deemed a terrorist group by the united states hezbollah is the most powerful group in lebanon thanks to a heavily armed militia that has fought several wars with israel
it has grown militarily stronger since joining the war in neighbouring syria in in support of president bashar
the amal movement seats the shi ite amal movement is led by parliament speaker nabih berri and has been closely aligned with hezbollah since the end of lebanon s civil war
amal has maintained very close ties to the syrian government since it was founded in
small hezbollah aligned parties seats these include the maronite christian marada party the syrian socialist nationalist party the baath party the armenian tashnag and the druze lebanese democratic party which were all represented in the previous parliament
in addition the heads of four parties that were not part of the last parliament won sunni seats this time
they are osama saad abdulrahim mrad adnan trabulsi and faisal karami
independents aligned with hezbollah and amal seats this group includes ites who are politically aligned with hezbollah and amal and ran on lists backed by the parties
several prominent hezbollah supporters running as independents have returned to public office for the first time since the withdrawal of syrian forces in
among them is jamil a retired shi ite general and close friend of assad who ran as independent and is a staunch supporter of hezbollah and its regional allies
the free patriotic movement fpm seats the fpm founded by maronite christian politician michel aoun has been a political ally of hezbollah since
the alliance is particularly important to hezbollah because the fpm is the biggest christian force in parliament
hezbollah s backing for aoun was vital to his bid to become head of state a goal he finally realised in in a political deal that saw saad become prime minister
aoun has said hezbollah s weapons are critical to the defence of lebanon
in an interview last year he said the lebanese army was not strong enough to confront israel and so hezbollah s arms were a necessity
aoun said on tuesday he intended to call a national dialogue to address issues including a national defence strategy a phrase that implies discussion of hezbollah s arms but without giving further details
his fpm leader gebran bassil came under fire in lebanon last year for saying lebanon did not have an ideological problem with israel
but in his role as foreign minister bassil has acted in hezbollah s interests at the arab league
nasrallah said in april the fpm alliance remained strong but this did not mean the parties had become one
future movement seats led by saad future lost more than a third of its seats but it remains the biggest party
hariri led a alliance through years of political conflict with hezbollah and its allies that spilled into a brief civil war in over the group s arms
the march alliance won a majority in but began disintegrating after the election and suffered from waning saudi support
hariri still wants hezbollah disarmed but says this is an issue that should be resolved by dialogue at the regional level
his focus is on reviving the stagnant economy and reforming the heavily indebted state
the lebanese forces lf seats led by maronite christian politician samir geagea the lebanese forces is hezbollah s most significant christian opponent
the lf which emerged from a powerful civil war militia has also been fiercely critical of hezbollah s role in the war in neighbouring syria
it is one of the biggest winners in the election almost doubling its seats
geagea said the result showed march still enjoys popular support
the kataeb seats the kataeb also known as the phalange party is led by maronite christian politician sami gemayel who took over the leadership from his father former president amin gemayel
in addition two other of the newly elected mps are known to have positions opposed to hezbollah
progressive socialist party psp seats led by druze leader walid jumblatt the psp has wavered on the issue of hezbollah s arms over the years
it was a pillar of the march alliance until the election but repositioned itself in the political centre after that vote
jumblatt said last year that hezbollah itself should be the one to decide when its weapons are put up for discussion
others seats these include political independents such as former prime minister najib mikati veteran christian politician michel and others whose views on hezbollah and its arms could not immediately be confirmed
