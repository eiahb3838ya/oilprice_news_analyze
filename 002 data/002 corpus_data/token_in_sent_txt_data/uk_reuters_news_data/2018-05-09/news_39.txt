refile-indian refiners in no rush to seek alternatives to iranian oil
refiles to fix headline by nidhi verma new delhi may reuters indian refiners said on wednesday they were in no hurry to replace iranian oil with alternatives counting on the fact that many western countries have so far declined to join the united states in pulling out of a nuclear deal with tehran
president donald trump said on tuesday he would reimpose economic curbs on iran after withdrawing the united states from the agreement that lifted sanctions against tehran in exchange for limits on its nuclear programme
but the leaders of britain germany and france which were signatories to the deal along with china and russia said in a joint statement that trump s decision was a cause for regret and concern and were seeking to salvage the deal
we are largely unaffected said
sharma finance chief at indian oil corp ioc
this time the situation is different from the last time
we hope clarity on the real impact of sanctions will emerge in ioc india s biggest refiner hopes to stick to its plans to buy as much as barrels per day bpd of oil from iran in more than double the volume in the last fiscal year that ended in march sharma said
it would be difficult to replace iranian oil given the commercial terms offered by tehran he said
india which has ties with iran but also has close political relations with the united states is iran s top oil client after china
its state refiners had chalked out plans to almost double oil imports from iran this fiscal year drawn to the virtual free shipping on oil sales offered by iran reuters reported last month
the south asian country remained a big buyer of iranian oil even during previous western sanctions though it had to cut purchases to win some waivers as the trade was mostly done in dollars
since the agreement however indian refiners have been settling oil dues with iran in euros
and given that three top european countries are still part of the deal trade won t be affected much at least in the short term said ramachandran head of refineries at bharat petroleum corp
in any case oil sanctions will kick in in about six months by which time most indian refiners may have consumed most of their iranian volumes ramachandran said
the treasury department has indicated that sanctions won t be reimposed immediately and will take up to days to allow iranian oil customers and other companies involved in doing business with tehran to make plans

surana chairman of hindustan petroleum said refiners may use that time to step up purchases from iran
the indian oil ministry has not commented on the pullout but the foreign ministry on wednesday called for diplomacy to resolve the dispute over the nuclear deal with iran
separately south korea said on wednesday it would seek exemptions to buy iranian oil a path many big oil consumers are likely to follow in the wake of new sanctions on tehran which will tighten world oil markets and push up prices
