update 2-california grid operator sees tight power supplies for summer
adds hydropower and generation details may reuters california s electric grid operator has forecast power supplies will be tight this summer due to below average hydropower production and reduced generation according to an assessment released on wednesday
the california independent system operator iso the grid operator said the system s capacity to serve consumers will be tight in periods in the summer months especially during the evenings of hot days when solar power dissipates
but it forecast only an extremely low probability it will be forced to initiate rotating power outages this summer
the iso which forecast peak demand during the summer would be about the same as last year said hydropower production is expected to be down megawatts mw by late summer compared with s hydropower output
one megawatt can power about homes
in addition the iso said natural generation will see a drop of about mw due to plant retirements
the iso assessment came a few days after a group of state regulators and regional power firms including the iso released a technical report warning of a moderate threat to gas and electric reliability this summer and a more serious threat next winter because the southern california gas socalgas system is operating at less than full capacity
socalgas cautioned that pipeline outages and restrictions on its giant aliso canyon gas storage facility in los angeles which suffered a devastating leak between october and february could reduce its ability to deliver gas to fuel power generation facilities in southern california this summer and winter
socalgas is a unit of california energy company sempra energy
the iso projected there will be mw of generation available to serve demand this summer with peak usage expected to reach mw under normal conditions
if temperatures are warmer than normal as they were last year the iso said supply margins will tighten significantly as consumers crank up their air conditioners
last year peak demand hit mw in september
the california department of water resources said water content of snowpack in the mountains was just percent of average as of april
in addition the iso said mw of generation retired since last summer including mw of resources
energy firms added mw of new power sources since last year but percent of that was solar which will not supply much when supplies are tight in the evenings
