norway turns to power imports after dry spring hits hydropower reserves
oslo july reuters norway has become a net power importer from denmark and sweden this summer after a warm and dry spring reduced the nation s hydropower reserves and drove up norwegian power prices the grid operator said on wednesday
norway s reservoirs have received rainfall in that is equivalent to terrawatt hours twh less than a normal year a shortfall equivalent to the energy needs of million households or half of norway s population
most of the imported power comes from denmark and sweden which had a surplus of wind power norway s grid statnett said in a statement adding that it was the first summer in several years that norway was a net power importer
given the snowy winter we had it may seem strange that we are in such a situation it said
although norway s reservoirs at percent full last week are at a marginally higher level than the same period last year most of the snow has already melted due to the unusually warm spring so there is less water being added
warm dry conditions have also led to more evaporation
dry weather is still expected and the hydrological balance is expected to deteriorate further in the short term it said
last year norway s reservoirs peaked at percent full
experts say the peak this year is likely to be far lower
lower water levels mean electricity will cost much more for consumers making it cheaper to import power
the price of norwegian power this summer exceeded euros per megawatt hour nearly double last year s level
the fact that we have the opportunity to import surplus power from our neighbouring countries means that we can exploit each other s energy systems and save on norwegian water resources when needed statnett said
