exclusive-japan's inpex delays production from giant australia gas project
tokyo july reuters japan s inpex corp has delayed gas production from its giant ichthys field off the coast of australia just weeks after giving assurances that output would start imminently
inpex s new chief executive officer told reuters the company was yet to start churning out gas from the billion project and did not give a timetable for when that would happen
japan s biggest oil and gas producer had said on june that commissioning of all onshore and offshore facilities at the project was complete and that gas would start flowing within a week or two
there are various minor issues to address in the final safety checks but there are no major problems with the facilities ueda said on tuesday in his first interview with overseas media since taking the helm at inpex last month
the liquefied natural gas lng project already hit by multiple delays is a major test for inpex as it marks the first time it has operated a major energy development on its own
we can start production in the not too distant future ueda said without giving details
he added that the company is keeping its target to ship its first lng cargo by the end of september
delays are common with large projects like ichthys but the development has been plagued by a wide range of issues including contractor disputes technical difficulties and bad weather
at full operation ichthys is expected to produce million tonnes of lng a year along with about million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas and around barrels per day of condensate an form of crude oil
