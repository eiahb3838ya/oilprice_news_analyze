update 5-saudi plans first change in asia crude oil price formula in decades, to use dme oman
formula to be based on dme oman platts dubai sources change to take place from october sources saudi move to boost oman futures trading on dme sources adds s p global platts comment by florence tan singapore july reuters saudi aramco plans to change the formula used to price its crude oil sales to asia starting from october marking the first change in benchmarks for its official selling prices osp since the the company said on wednesday
trade sources had earlier told reuters of the planned change
the new formula will be based on the average monthly prices of oman crude futures traded on the dubai mercantile exchange dme and the average cash price for dubai assessed by pricing agency s p global platts instead of the average of oman and dubai prices assessed by platts aramco said
saudi aramco s osps for october will be based on the average settlement prices for the dme december oman contract and the december dubai cash price assessed by platts both of which are set in october
s p global platts said in a statement that it respected each market participant s right to decide its preferred way of pricing term contracts but that the market decides which price references are ultimately adopted as benchmarks
we are closely engaged with a wide variety of market participants in this ongoing discussion including in saudi arabia and we believe platts benchmarks remain robust and relevant to all market participants it said
dme did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by reuters
while saudi aramco s decision surprised the market a proposal to switch benchmarks has been discussed internally for years the sources said
the dme launched the oman contract in and it is the most liquid physically deliverable futures contract for middle east crude oil
in comparison there are rarely bids or offers for oman cargoes during the platts price assessment
it is obvious look at the trading volumes of dme versus platts for oman said adi imsirovic a teaching fellow at the university of surrey s energy economics centre who wrote a paper on middle east oil benchmarks published in
last year iraq s oil marketing organization somo proposed pricing its basra crude sales to asia on dme oman futures starting with cargoes but the plan was shelved
somo was the first on the case but they did not think it through nominations
somo went back to the drawing board
aramco could not be left behind imsirovic said
here saudi aramco s decision could improve the liquidity for oman futures trading on the dme and also for derivative instruments based off the oman contract for hedging or price conversion purposes a trader said
this is a good change as platts oman can not be hedged he said
saudi aramco usually sets its monthly osps around the fifth of each month and those set the trend for iranian kuwaiti and iraqi prices affecting more than million barrels per day bpd of crude bound for asia
it was not immediately clear if the other middle east producers will also change their benchmarks
