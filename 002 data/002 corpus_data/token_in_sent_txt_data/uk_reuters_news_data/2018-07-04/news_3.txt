in may trump pulled out of a multinational deal under which sanctions on iran were lifted in return for curbs to its nuclear programme verified by the international atomic energy agency iaea
washington has since told countries they must stop buying iranian oil from or face financial measures
iran s nuclear activities have always been for peaceful purposes but it is iran that would decide on its level of cooperation with the iaea iranian state news agency irna quoted rouhani as saying after meeting iaea head yukiya amano in vienna
the responsibility for the change of iran s cooperation level with the iaea falls on those who have created this new situation he added
rouhani said earlier in the day tehran would stand firm against threats to cut iranian oil sales
the americans say they want to reduce iranian oil exports to zero
it shows they have not thought about its consequences rouhani was quoted as saying by irna
on tuesday rouhani hinted at a threat to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries if washington tries to cut its exports
he did not elaborate but an iranian revolutionary guards commander explicitly said on wednesday iran would block any exports of crude for the gulf in retaliation for hostile action
if they want to stop iranian oil exports we will not allow any oil shipment to pass through the strait of hormuz ismail kowsari was quoted as saying by the young journalists club yjc website
qassem soleimani commander of the quds force in charge of foreign operations for the revolutionary guards said in a letter published on irna i kiss your rouhani s hand for expressing such wise and timely comments and i am at your service to implement any policy that serves the islamic rouhani in vienna trying to salvage the nuclear deal said sanctions were a crime and aggression and called on european and other governments to stand up to trump
iran will survive this round of sanctions as it has survived them before
this government will not stay in office forever
but history will judge other nations based on what they do today he said
rouhani told reporters that if the remaining signatories the europeans britain france and germany as well as china and russia can guarantee iran s benefits iran will remain in the nuclear deal without the united iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili said on the iranian oil ministry news agency shana trump s demand that iranian oil should not be bought and his pressures on european firms at a time when nigeria and libya are in crisis when venezuela s oil exports have fallen due to sanctions when saudi s domestic consumption has increased in summer is nothing but self harm
it will increase the prices of oil in the global markets he said
at the end it is the american consumer who will pay the price for trump s the european union once iran s biggest oil importer has vowed to keep the deal alive without the united states by trying to keep iran s oil and investment flowing
but european officials acknowledge that sanctions make it difficult to give tehran guarantees
foreign ministers from the five remaining signatories will meet iranian officials in vienna on friday to discuss how to keep the accord alive
