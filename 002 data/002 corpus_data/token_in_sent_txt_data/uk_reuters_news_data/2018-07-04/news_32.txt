exclusive-japan's inpex delays output from giant offshore gas project in australia
tokyo reuters japan s inpex corp has delayed gas production from its giant ichthys field off the coast of australia just weeks after giving assurances that output would start imminently
inpex s new chief executive officer told reuters the company was yet to start churning out gas from the billion billion project and did not give a timetable for when that would happen
japan s biggest oil and gas producer had said on june that commissioning of all onshore and offshore facilities at the project was complete and that gas would start flowing within a week or two
there are various minor issues to address in the final safety checks but there are no major problems with the facilities ueda said on tuesday in his first interview with overseas media since taking the helm at inpex last month
the liquefied natural gas lng project already hit by multiple delays is a major test for inpex as it marks the first time it has operated a major energy development on its own
we can start production in the not too distant future ueda said without giving details
he added that the company is keeping its target to ship its first lng cargo by the end of september
ichthys will send gas from an offshore central processing facility through an pipeline to the mainland near the city of darwin where it will be processed into lng for export
delays are common with large projects like ichthys but the development has been plagued by a wide range of issues including contractor disputes technical difficulties and bad weather
inpex aims to start the project s second liquefaction train by a few months after the first unit starts operating
at full operation ichthys is expected to produce million tonnes of lng a year along with about million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas and around barrels per day of condensate an form of crude oil
ichthys will likely take two or three years to reach full production ueda said
after that inpex will assess market demand for a possible doubling of the project s capacity using known gas reserves in the area he said
should it expand the project further major pipelines will likely be unnecessary ueda added
getting ichthys up and running will be a significant boost for inpex as the project is expected to account for half of its billion yen million profit forecast for this business year
inpex holds percent of ichthys france s total percent with the rest spread amongst taiwan s cpc corp and japanese utilities
ueda said inpex has accumulated valuable experience from ichthys that it would apply to its abadi lng project in indonesia where it hopes to start production in the late
