china no longer participating in start of aviation emissions deal
reuters china has cooled to a landmark deal to curb emissions from international flights with the country no longer listed as a participant in the agreement s first phase according to the united nations aviation agency s website
china does not appear on a june list of participants in the voluntary phase of the deal brokered by the international civil aviation organization in according to icao s website
aviation powerhouse china was included in previous lists seen by reuters
it is not clear why china now objects to the deal
the first or pilot phase begins in
environmentalists say china s participation is vital for the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia deal which requires airlines to limit their emissions or offset them by buying carbon credits from designated environmental projects around the world
europe will press china to remain after the country recently argued it never agreed to join the first phase according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity about the private talks
in the months to come europe together with its icao partners will work with china to find ways to address china s concerns without undermining the deal s environmental integrity in order to keep this important aviation country on board a european union source said on tuesday
the civil aviation administration of china and icao did not respond to requests for comment
in china and the united states pledged support for the deal with both countries saying they expect to be early a second source said china is likely distancing itself as a negotiating tactic
talks are expected this fall over which environmental projects will be available to airlines for purchase as offset credits
china wants its domestic projects to be eligible the source said
the united states which last year announced plans to withdraw from the paris climate pact is still in the aviation deal and the federal aviation administration said it would continue to work on the implementation of airlines support the agreement as a cheaper alternative to a patchwork of regional deals
citing icao figures the air transport action group estimates corsia will cost airlines between billion and billion in depending on future carbon prices
we are disappointed that the chinese government has decided not to participate in the pilot phase of corsia said atag executive director michael gill in a statement
