"bag rage" prompts backdown on plastic bag levy in australia
sydney reuters australia s supermarket coles on wednesday halted plans to charge shoppers for plastic bags succumbing to customer fury about a shift away from plastics
coles owned by wesfarmers and its larger rival woolworths group ltd removed plastic bags from stores late in june as part of a national push to reduce waste selling reusable ones for a small fee instead
it drew a furious response dubbed bag rage as customers angry about having to bring their own sacks or pay australian cents cents for a reusable plastic bag abused checkout staff and vented on social media
the union representing store workers launched a public campaign on the issue and both grocers capitulated temporarily waiving the fee
coles which had initially planned to reintroduce the fee on july never levied it and has now extended the waiver indefinitely
some customers told us they needed more time to make the transition to reusable bags the company said in a statement
many customers bringing bags from home are still finding themselves short a bag or two so we are offering complimentary reusable bags to help them complete their shopping it said
the waiver was still intended to be an interim measure coles said but gave no date for the resumption of the fee saying only it will assess when customers have become accustomed to bringing their own woolworths has levied per bag since july
the backflip comes while coles is under immense pressure to lure customers as its sales growth lags woolworths just as wesfarmers prepares to spin it out and list it separately
it s all a part of lifting their customer satisfaction and getting more customers in the door said james tao a market analyst at stockbroker commonwealth securities in sydney
the cost of the move would probably have a negligible financial impact he added
it s more about the pr however that also appeared to backfire as coles was lampooned online
