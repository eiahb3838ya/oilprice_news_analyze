israel halts fuel shipments to gaza citing continued fire balloon launches
jerusalem reuters israel will stop shipments of fuel and gas to the gaza strip from thursday in response to militants in the enclave launching incendiary balloons that have torched fields in israel
a statement from defence minister avigdor lieberman s office on wednesday said he had ordered a halt to fuel supplies into the strip via the kerem shalom crossing until further notice
the decision has been taken in view of the continued terror of incendiary balloons and friction along the border fence the statement said
four months of weekly friday border protests that began on march have calmed slightly but organisers have vowed they will continue until israel lifts economic sanctions on the enclave
at least palestinians have been killed in the protests and one israeli soldier was shot dead by a sniper in gaza
israel has lost tracts of farmland and forests to fires set by kites and helium balloons laden with incendiary material and flown over from gaza
israel had already responded by preventing the entry of commercial goods to gaza
