everyday plastics emit greenhouse gases, scientists say
new york aug thomson reuters foundation plastic used in everyday objects from bottles to packaging emit greenhouse gases when exposed to sunlight according to a study released on wednesday as global concern about its impact on the world s oceans grows
plastic pollution has come under increased scrutiny from environmentalists as the scale of the problem has become clear this year it emerged that a giant island made up of plastic waste in the pacific ocean was far larger than thought
now scientists have discovered that commonly used plastics also generate the potent greenhouse gas methane as well as ethylene as they age adding to the global tally of emissions
the study published in the journal plos one said plastics were likely to be an insignificant component of the global methane budget due to the low quantities produced in this way
nonetheless jonathan nichols an associate professor of earth sciences at columbia university in new york said the finding was definitely important
you can t solve the greenhouse gas problem until you ve defined every part of it he told the thomson reuters foundation by phone
methane emissions mainly caused by burning fossil fuels are a major driver of global warming putting them in the crosshairs of the global fight against climate change
jennifer provencher a plastic pollution researcher at acadia university in canada said the results pointed to another piece of evidence suggesting that losing plastic to the environment is not good
more than nine billion tons of plastic has been produced since with most of it discarded in landfills or the environment previous research has found
scientists have repeatedly linked exposure to some plastic chemicals such as bisphenol a bpa to health risks
the garbage patch of plastic floating in the pacific holds as much as times more debris than was previously thought posing a significant threat to the food chain scientists found in march
