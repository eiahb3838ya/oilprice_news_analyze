iran is seen readying major exercise as tensions with u.s. simmer
washington reuters the united states believes iran is preparing to carry out a major exercise in the gulf in the coming days apparently moving up the timing of annual drills amid heightened tensions with washington officials told reuters on wednesday
iran has been furious over president donald trump s decision to pull out of an international nuclear deal and reimpose sanctions on tehran
senior iranian officials have warned the country would not easily yield to a renewed campaign to strangle iran s vital oil exports
the military s central command confirmed that it has seen an increase in iranian activity including in the strait of hormuz a strategic waterway for oil shipments that iran s revolutionary guards have threatened to block
we are aware of the increase in iranian naval operations within the arabian gulf strait of hormuz and gulf of oman said navy captain bill urban the chief spokesman at central command which oversees forces in the middle east
we are monitoring it closely and will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways urban added
urban did not provide further information or comment on questions about the expected iranian drills
but officials speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity said iran s revolutionary guards has appeared to prepare more than vessels for exercises
hundreds of ground forces could also be involved
they said the drills could begin within the next hours although the precise timing was unclear
details of the iranian preparations were first reported by cnn
officials said the timing of the drills appeared designed to send a message to washington which is intensifying its economic and diplomatic pressure on tehran but so far stopping short of using the military to more aggressively counter iran and its proxies
trump s policies are already putting significant pressure on the iranian economy although intelligence suggests they may ultimately rally iranians against the united states and strengthen iran s hardline rulers officials say
iran s currency plumbed new depths this week as iranians brace for when washington is due to reimpose a first lot of economic sanctions following trump s withdrawal from the nuclear deal
