interview-japan's deputy chief cabinet secretary says us trade talks not a prelude to fta
tokyo reuters talks next week between japanese economy minister toshimitsu motegi and trade representative robert lighthizer are not a prelude to a free trade agreement fta japanese deputy chief cabinet secretary yasutoshi nishimura said on wednesday
nishimura also told reuters in an interview that japan did not intend to set numerical targets on either exports or imports
the talks in washington come as president donald trump s administration explores raising tariffs on foreign auto imports including those from japan a step that officials say would do serious damage to the two economies and world trade
the united states is a major market for japan s automakers which produced million vehicles at their plants in roughly of the million total units produced in the country each year
an additional million vehicles were exported from japan last year
trump wants a trade pact as a way to reduce america s trade deficit with japan but tokyo is wary of fta talks because they would increase pressure to open sensitive markets such as agriculture
japan does not desire an fta and these talks are not at all preliminary discussions on an fta nishimura said
nishimura reiterated that japan would keep trying to persuade washington to return to a multilateral partnership pact abandoned by trump soon after he took office last year
however he acknowledged that washington s preference was for bilateral deals
we will be looking for the best path for both the united states and japan nishimura said
he repeated that japan was expected to increase imports of liquefied natural gas from america and buy military gear needed for its defence
japanese firms want to invest in the robust market and japan wants to support that he said
however nishimura ruled out setting a numerical limit on japanese auto exports to the united states a tactic taken during trade wars in the and early before the launch of the world trade organization which generally bans such steps
whether it s exports or imports we will not set numerical targets nishimura said
the fundamental thing is to maintain free and fair nishimura declined to say what steps japan would take if washington raised its tariffs on auto imports
raising tariffs on autos would have a big impact on the world economy and would be a big minus for the american economy so we want to talk firmly so that does no happen he said
