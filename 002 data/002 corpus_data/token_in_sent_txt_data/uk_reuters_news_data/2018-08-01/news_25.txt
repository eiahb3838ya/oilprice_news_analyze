update 1-berlin signals readiness to use new takeover veto after chinese bid for leifeld
berlin reuters berlin signalled on wednesday that it was prepared to use its new power to veto foreign takeovers of german companies in the case of a chinese bid for toolmaker leifeld
earlier on wednesday leifeld s majority owner georg koffler told reuters that china s yantai taihai had dropped its attempt to buy the company ahead of an expected veto by the german government
the german government tightened controls on foreign investments last year after a series of takeovers by chinese firms fuelled concern over the security implications of china s growing appetite for european firms
the cabinet today decided to grant authorisation for a veto a government source said
this authorisation allows for vetoing the purchase of a domestic company by a foreign company for security leifeld a maker of metalworking tools that are crucial in the nuclear power sector is typical of the technically advanced mittelstand manufacturing firms that underpin germany s success as a global export powerhouse
koffler criticised berlin s willingness to intervene saying the security concerns about letting china s yantai buy into germany s nuclear industry were overblown
we believe these security policy concerns are unjustified he said
he said the company would pursue a partial flotation of its shares this year as an alternative to the sale originally planned
across europe authorities are looking warily at bids by chinese firms for the kinds of advanced manufacturers that underpin the continent s relative prosperity compared to economies
last month a german state bank bought a stake in grid operator to prevent china s state grid acquiring the shareholding and promised to consider ways of better protecting companies from foreign acquisition
the head of germany s domestic intelligence service also warned that chinese state actors seeking trade secrets could be behind bids that nominally came from private firms highlighting a seeming correlation between a decline in hacking attempts originating from china with an increase in bids
