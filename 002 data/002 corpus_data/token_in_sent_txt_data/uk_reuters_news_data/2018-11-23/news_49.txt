exclusive-trafigura, bp increase loans to russia-backed indian refiner to $3 bln
new reuters indian refiner nayara energy is set to secure its biggest loan a billion advance from trafigura bp and some banks according to industry and banking sources familiar with the matter
it takes the total size of nayara s deals to nearly billion billion pounds despite concerns over sanctions
the company previously owned by the essar group is gradually raising its profile on india s energy map
it is scouting to secure its future revenue streams by locking in export financing deals
trafigura and oil major bp are in the process of syndicating a billion loan to be repaid with future gasoline and gasoil cargoes from the refinery over four years the sources said
the syndication is expected to be completed before the end of the year they said
nayara formerly essar oil was taken over by a consortium led by russian oil major rosneft in
rosneft owns percent of nayara while russian fund ucp and swiss commodities trader trafigura together own a similar share
in last year s deal the consortium acquired the refinery in vadinar as well as a port power plant and fuel stations for nearly billion
since then nayara has expanded its retail fuel network to about stations and has set a target of reaching in three years its chairman anand said in september
nayara previously depended on close to indian banks for its financing adding foreign exchange costs as it would have to buy crude in dollars using indian rupees an untenable and expensive proposition
deals are a normal mechanism to raise funds but western banks were initially hesitant to participate in nayara s deals due to the russian companies stakes in it and the refiner s reliance on iranian and venezuelan oil
russia has been under and eu sanctions since when it occupied ukraine s crimea peninsula and rosneft is under limited sanctions
washington sanctions on iranian oil in early november and the trump administration has weighed restrictions on venezuelan oil
nayara s previous ownership under conglomerate essar group added to the qualms
however a banking source said that nayara s intention to stop buying iranian oil and a company name change improved the compliance outlook for the bank
for the current billion deal bp trafigura and bankers involved will float a special purpose vehicle while for the previous such transactions that mandate was directly given to the buyers
trafigura declined to comment
bp did not immediately respond to a request for comment
asked for comment on the loan nayara said in a statement sent to reuters that its improved financial performance and credit rating over the last year had attracted more interest in working with the company
this transformation of the company in the last one year has resulted in substantial interest from the top global and domestic banks who wish to partner with the company anup vikal nayara s chief financial officer said
as a part of this drive towards further efficiency and global interest we are constantly evaluating multiple opportunities including export advance as the company moves into the new deutsche bank and abn amro are among the foreign banks involved the sources said
the banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment
the new deal would bring nayara s total transactions during the year to nearly billion
trafigura and bp have already completed two similar deals
syndication of a billion prepayment first reported by reuters early this year was finalised in september for a lower amount of million over months one of the sources said
another million over months began in march
