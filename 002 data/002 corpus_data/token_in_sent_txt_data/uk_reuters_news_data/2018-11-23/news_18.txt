climate cash for developing world set to meet u.n. 2020 goal
barcelona nov thomson reuters foundation cash from wealthy countries to help the developing world tackle climate change has risen substantially in recent years putting them on track to meet a politically important target to go green and adapt to wild weather analysts said on friday
the amount rich nations provided themselves and raised from the private sector in exceeded billion according to data in a biennial assessment
government funding accounted for about billion a jump of percent in two years
at climate talks in rich countries agreed to raise billion a year by to back efforts by vulnerable poorer states to shift their economies onto a greener path and adapt to more extreme weather and rising seas
analysts said the figures were a positive signal ahead of next month s negotiations tasked with finalising rules to put a global accord to tackle climate change into practice
joe thwaites a researcher at the world resources institute said climate finance was a critically important part of the paris agreement because poorer countries need the money to ramp up efforts to reduce emissions
as of developed nations appeared to be on track to fulfil their billion pledge but there are concerns over whether progress has been maintained since then he added
after donald trump took power in the president said he would not deliver of a pledge made by his predecessor to the green climate fund
given potential backsliding in the and australia and among some other countries it s reasonable to ask was a high watermark for climate finance said thwaites
yet funding from international development banks rose percent between and and european union states have maintained their contributions he added
however experts said more cash continued to be spent on the push to reduce emissions by boosting renewable energy and energy efficiency rather than on coping with climate change impacts
adaptation which includes measures from crops and higher sea walls to protecting slum dwellers from heat received only about a quarter of funding analysts said
adaptation finance is still lagging behind and needs to be scaled up especially considering the rising climate impacts we are seeing helena wright a senior policy advisor with think tank told the thomson reuters foundation
globally climate finance increased percent between and reaching billion the report said
renewable energy investment dropped by percent in in part because technology costs fell but there was an percent rise in investment in energy efficiency and a percent boost for greener transport according to the figures
wright noted that governments continued to provide huge subsidies for the fossil fuel industry billion in
those should be phased out to meet political commitments and to align finance with the paris pact vision of a world she added
