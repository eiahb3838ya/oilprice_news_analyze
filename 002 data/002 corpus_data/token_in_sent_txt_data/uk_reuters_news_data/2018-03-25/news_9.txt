to date we do not have any money to do all the necessary things tom edabe the disaster coordinator for the province of hela said by telephone from tari its capital
the government is trying to assist and have budgeted some money but to date we have not received anything we have only been given food and items supplied by other continuing aftershocks rattle residents who have to collect water brought by daily rainstorms to ensure adequate supplies edabe the disaster coordinator said
the biggest thing that people need apart from food is water said james pima a helicopter pilot and flight manager at aviation firm helisolutions in the western highlands capital of mt
hagen about km miles from the disaster zone
they don t have clean water to cook or drink they are standing there staring
the expression on their faces is his firm s three helicopters fly relief missions fully every day pima added
destruction to roads and runways means authorities must rely on helicopters to fly in relief
but while nimble the craft can only carry smaller loads than aircraft and can not fly during the afternoon thunderstorms
the logistics problems wind all the way to png s disaster center where officials told reuters they had been locked out of their office in port moresby the capital for two days last week after the government missed a rental payment
that was correct monday and tuesday a spokeswoman said
in a joint report with the united nations published on friday the agency cited lack of quality data about food shortages limited aircraft assets and significant gaps in sanitation support as being the biggest problems it faced
the office of prime minister peter o neill did not respond to emailed questions from reuters
on his website o neill has previously said there will be no quick fix the damage from this disaster will take months and years to be the government had approved relief funds amounting to million kina million o neill said initially but a later statement mentioned only million kina in initial relief or less than percent had been allocated to the areas
in its november budget the government made plans to rein in spending and trim debt projected to stand at billion kina in
the impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner after the quake forced a shutdown of exxon mobil corp s liquefied natural gas project which has annual sales of billion at current lng prices
the firm is still assessing quake damage at its facilities
o neill last week hit out at critics of the aid effort for playing political games while thanking australia and new zealand for military aircraft that provided assistance beyond the capacity of png s own defense forces
his political opponent former prime minister mekere morauta had called the government s response tardy and inadequate
relief sources say mobile medical centers and operating theaters are needed urgently and that only international partners can supply them morauta said last week
foreign aid pledges of about million have come in from australia china the european union japan new zealand and the united states says the united nations most of it provided by private companies
exxon and its partner oil search ltd say they have provided million in cash and kind for quake relief
local officials say the scale of destruction with villages buried by landslides and provincial towns flattened has overwhelmed authorities in papua new guinea which straddles the geologically active pacific ring of fire
policemen are still struggling because there is no support flying in and out said naring bongi of the police station in the southern highlands capital of mendi
there is not enough food to supply care centers they need fresh water he added
