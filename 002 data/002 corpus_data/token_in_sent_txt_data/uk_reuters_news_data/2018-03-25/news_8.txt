pro-government candidates in election for rubber-stamp turkmen parliament
almaty march reuters people in turkmenistan are to vote in a parliamentary election on sunday with a choice between three parties and some independents but all the candidates are ultimately loyal to the desert nation s leader president kurbanguly berdymukhamedov
one of the candidates is the president s son serdar berdymukhamedov regarded by observers as a potential successor to the leader who is referred to by local people as arkadag or protector
although the vote takes place against the backdrop of foreign currency shortages brought on by a drop in gas exports there are no opposition parties in the former soviet republic of six million
there are candidates contesting seats in the legislature the main job of which is to bills drafted by the cabinet
another body in the predominantly muslim nation is the halk maslahaty or people s council which is chaired by the president has more powers than parliament and consists of deputies elected by local councils
however the position of parliament speaker is important because they become acting president if the head of state is unable to carry out his work
some observers have tipped serdar berdymukhamedov to eventually become speaker and the designated successor to his father who has run the country since and is the centre of an extravagant personality cult

in a symbolical move serdar berdymukhamedov who had worked as a diplomat before becoming an mp in attended a summit of central asian leaders in kazakhstan this month which his father skipped
turkmenistan s economy depends heavily on exports of natural gas and russia was its main customer for decades thanks to pipelines
but moscow halted purchases of turkmen gas in leaving china which has built its own pipeline from scratch as the main buyer
the ashgabat government is building a new pipeline through neighbouring afghanistan to pakistan and china in an attempt to open up additional export markets
