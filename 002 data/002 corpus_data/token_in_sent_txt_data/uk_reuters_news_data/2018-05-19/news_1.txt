update 2-iran says oil export drop not expected if eu saves nuclear deal
tehran reuters iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said on saturday that president donald trump s decision to quit a multinational nuclear deal would not affect tehran s oil exports if the eu could salvage the pact
every new decision in opec needs unanimity
i believe that if the european union helps us the level of the oil exports of iran will not change zanganeh told reporters after a meeting with the eu s energy chief miguel arias canete
following trump s decision on may the treasury said washington would reimpose a wide array of sanctions after the expiry of and periods including sanctions aimed at iran s oil sector and transactions with its central bank
the eu wants to salvage the nuclear deal which offers the islamic republic relief from economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme
europe sees the agreement as an important element of international security
during the last round of sanctions iran s oil supplies fell by around one million barrels per day but the country as a major oil exporter after sanctions were lifted in
however major european companies partly wary of the remaining sanctions on iran have been reluctant to do business with tehran which needs to attract over billion in foreign investment to boost its crude output
i have no doubt that these extraterritorial sanctions from against iran will have an impact on foreign investment in iran zanganeh told reporters
it will not stop us but will reduce the rate of in the wake of new sanctions some buyers of opec s oil producer said they would seek waivers to purchase iranian crude
our main customers are in asia but we expect to preserve and save this level of exports to europe and africa he said
arias canete who is in tehran for a trip presented iranian counterparts with an array of potential measures drafted by the eu this week to mitigate the impact of sanctions in a bid to bolster moderates around president hassan rouhani who want to keep trade open with the west
we want to solve all the problems that are impeding normal trade in oil arias canete said
zanganeh said iran was particularly keen for the eu to act on a proposal urging eu governments make direct payments for oil exports to iran s central bank bypassing the financial system
other measures included renewing a measure to protect european businesses in iran and allowing the european investment bank to do business in iran
eu investment in iran mainly from germany france and italy has jumped to more than billion euros since in projects ranging from aerospace to energy
but some foreign firms have already started signaling their intent to pull back from iran
the french energy company total said on wednesday it will pull out of a gas project in iran if it can not secure a waiver from sanctions
iran had hailed the contract as a symbol of the accord s success
if total does not receive waivers they will quit and will be replaced by a chinese company zanganeh said
french gas and power group engie polish gas firm pgnig and german lender dz bank were the latest companies on friday to say that their business dealings with iran would be affected by new sanctions
zanganeh said other countries such as russia and china were keen to fill the vacuum left by the potential exit of european investors
the chinese are very eager
two big companies sinopec and cnpc are our historical partners for iran
in the biggest fields in iran they are eager to be involved zanganeh said
