a row had broken out after president uhuru kenyatta cut the share of the turkana county government to percent and that of the local community to percent leaving the rest to the national government

the deal will allow a law on oil exploration and production to clear parliament letting exports begin
we will intensify our exploration efforts not just in turkana but in the rest of the country now that we have a legal instrument that can help guide how oil and gas will be handled in our republic the president said
the deal was struck after the national government agreed to eliminate a cap on the revenue due to the county government and the local community said a senior government official
officials in nairobi had proposed to cap the annual allocation from oil exports to turkana arguing that the local economy could not absorb a sudden influx of too much cash
