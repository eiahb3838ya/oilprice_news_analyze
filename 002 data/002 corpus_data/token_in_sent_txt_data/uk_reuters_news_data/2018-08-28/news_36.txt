plowing $8 bln into brazil mature basin could boost oil output -report
rio de janeiro reuters investing billion billion in brazil s waning offshore campos basin could boost its oil production by barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd by consultancy wood mackenzie said in a report on tuesday
oil majors have already ploughed billions into brazil now latin america s top producer to lock in stakes in its offshore oil play where billions of barrels of oil are trapped beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor
meanwhile oil and gas production in the campos basin where activity began about forty years ago has fallen by a third over the last seven years to million boepd raising the spectre of hefty outlays to close down operations
campos basin is still a cash cow for petrobras said luiz hayum who authored the report
although output is declining brazil s oil company petroleo brasileiro the world s most indebted oil company invests very little there which means the basin is a healthy source of free cash flow he said
this is not sustainable for a long time
without receiving this additional investment platforms would cease production by some billion are needed to decommission those platforms and related infrastructure in the basin from to wood mackenzie forecasts
but redirecting that money to boosting output instead could add boepd to production by postpone percent of the decommissioning costs until after and add billion in royalty payments to the government the consultancy said
under a more optimistic scenario where brazil boosts its recovery factor in the basin to levels seen in the gulf of mexico and the north sea billion barrels of additional oil could be recovered it estimates
petrobras has been seeking outside investment to boost output from mature fields as it focuses its own limited capital investment budget on its promising holdings
last year norway s equinor formerly statoil paid up to billion for a percent stake in petrobras roncador part of a bid to boost oil recovery in one of brazil s largest fields in the campos basin
reuters reported in july that petrobras entered exclusive talks to sell two shallow water mature oil clusters in campos to a group backed by eig global energy partners in a deal said to be worth some billion
