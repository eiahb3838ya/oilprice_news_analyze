in a posh bangkok neighbourhood, residents trade energy with blockchain
bangkok aug thomson reuters foundation residents in a bangkok neighbourhood are trying out a renewable energy trading platform that allows them to buy and sell electricity between themselves signalling the growing popularity of such systems as solar panels get cheaper
the pilot project in the centre of thailand s capital is among the world s largest renewable energy trading platforms using blockchain according to the firms involved
the system has a total generating capacity of kw that can be traded via bangkok city s electricity grid between a mall a school a dental hospital and an apartment complex
commercial operations will begin next month said david martin managing director of power ledger an australian firm that develops technology for the energy industry and is a partner in the project
by enabling trade in renewable energy the community meets its own energy demands leading to lower bills for buyers better prices for sellers and a smaller carbon footprint for all he said
it will encourage more consumers to make the switch to renewable energy as the cost can be offset by selling excess energy to neighbours he told the thomson reuters foundation
neighbourhoods from new york to melbourne are upending the way power is produced and sold with solar panels mini grids and smart meters that can measure when energy is consumed rather than overall consumption
the world energy council predicts that such decentralised energy will grow to about a fourth of the market in from percent today
helping it along is blockchain the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin currency which offers a transparent way to handle complex transactions between users producers and even traders and utilities
blockchain also saves individuals the drudgery of switching between sending power and receiving it said martin
for the pilot in bangkok s upmarket sukhumvit neighbourhood electricity generated by each of the four locations will be initially used within that building
excess energy can be sold to the others through the trading system
if there is a surplus from all four it will be sold to the local energy storage system and to the grid in the future said gloyta nathalang a spokeswoman for thai renewable energy firm bcpg which installed the meters and solar panels
thailand is southeast asia s leading developer of renewable energy and aims to have it account for percent of final energy consumption by
the energy ministry has encouraged community renewable energy projects to reduce fossil fuel usage and the regulator is drafting new rules to permit the trade of energy
the bangkok metropolitan electricity authority forecasts energy trading to become mainstream for power generation in the long run a spokesman told reporters
bcpg in partnership with the thai real estate developer sansiri plans to roll out similar energy trading systems with solar panels and blockchain for a total capacity of mw by said gloyta
there are opportunities everywhere not just in cities but also in islands and remote areas where electricity supply is a challenge she said
