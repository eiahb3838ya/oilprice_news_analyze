we are not with economic sanctions against any country and that is our strategic position state television quoted abadi as saying at a weekly news conference
his statement was the first by an iraqi official since reuters reported last week that baghdad was going to ask washington for exemptions from some of the sanctions because iraq s economy is closely linked with neighbouring iran
