update 2-equinor explores floating wind turbines to power n.sea oilfields
stavanger norway reuters norway s equinor said on tuesday it is considering whether to build a pioneering offshore wind farm with floating turbines to supply electricity to two north sea oilfields as part of a strategy to curb greenhouse gas emissions
the project at the gullfaks and snorre oilfields would cost around billion norwegian crowns million and could reduce norway s emissions of carbon dioxide by more than tonnes per year equinor said
this could be the first time an offshore wind farm is directly connected to oil and gas platforms equinor said in a statement
the two fields currently are powered by generators running on natural gas at the platforms
norway s greenhouse gas emissions have remained high despite pledges for deep cuts under international accords such as the paris climate deal
last year norway s annual emissions were percent above levels at million tonnes
to maintain profitable operations offshore norway in the long term it is essential that we do our utmost to further reduce the carbon footprint from our activities executive vice president arne sigve nylund said
formerly known as statoil equinor earlier this year changed its name to underscore a push into renewable energy under chief executive eldar saetre although oil and gas will remain the company s dominant business
the company s first floating offshore wind farm began operating off scotland last year supplying electricity to the onshore market
equinor has also announced plans for offshore wind projects in the united states poland and britain
a final investment decision on the plan for snorre and gullfaks known as the hywind tampen floating wind farm will be made in equinor said
the company will seek to reduce the cost from the preliminary estimate
equinor said it hoped norwegian government subsidies would cover half the capital expenditure for the project where turbines each with a capacity of eight megawatts would meet about percent of the power demand from the two fields
electricity generation costs could be percent less than the euros a megawatt hour at the scottish project
this will help reduce norway s overall carbon emissions marius holm head of environmental foundation zero told reuters
the move will also help industrialise offshore wind and bring costs the gullfaks field is owned by equinor omv and norway s petoro while snorre is held by equinor petoro exxonmobil idemitsu dea and point resources
