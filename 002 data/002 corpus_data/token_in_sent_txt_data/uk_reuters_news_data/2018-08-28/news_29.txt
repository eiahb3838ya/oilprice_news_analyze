corrected-(official)-equinor to boost drilling to extend norwegian shelf life
number of wells in paragraph corrected to from after company official corrects original statement stavanger norway aug reuters oil producer equinor aims to boost the recovery rate from its norwegian fields to well above the global average to extend production from the mature basin beyond
equinor announced plans on tuesday to drill up to wells offshore from its native norway in coming decades almost as many as it has drilled since its startup in to mitigate declining output from older fields and extend the production lifetime of more than installations
the company said it remained on track for to keep profitable oil and gas production in norway towards but needed new measures to tackle a decline after that including a deliberate push to find more natural gas
we aim to achieve an average recovery rate of and per cent respectively at our oil and gas fields
this is almost twice the average global oil recovery rate of per cent arne sygve nylund equinor s head of development and production in norway said
equinor s current recovery rate for oil stands at percent
the company did not provide a recovery rate for gas
nylund didn t say when the company aimed to achieve the target rates but the plan to drill up to production and exploration wells covers a period up to
the plan meant that equinor will i drill about production wells per year to boost the output from the existing field up from the previous plan of wells indicated earlier this year a spokesman for the company said
in addition equinor plans to drill between and exploration wells each year off norway including both its own and wells to search for new reserves
i think we can keep that rate for at least another five years dodson told reuters
the norwegian company europe s gas supplier after russia s gazprom said it would prioritize natural gas in its exploration plans offshore norway aiming to add more volumes around the existing infrastructure such as the aasta hansteen field in the norwegian sea and elsewhere
natural gas is a commodity important to climate we see more demand for gas and we can play a bigger role in producing and delivering gas to the global markets nylund told reuters
we also need to use the existing infrastructure in a timely manner it will not last forever he added
while the company believes its norwegian resource potential is as large today as it was a decade ago each prospect is smaller making it necessary to drill more and cheaper wells exploration chief tim dodson told a news conference
the company is currently investing heavily to develop the billion johan sverdrup oilfield which will be completed in two stages between and as well as the arctic johan castberg and an extension of the troll gas field
we need to start now
after there are currently few big projects remaining
the choices that we the authorities and the industry make today will be decisive nylund said
we have developed a strategy for more gas exploration
we will also test new ideas in some prospects every year
the likelihood of discovery in these wells will be lower than in other targets but we see it as necessary to regularly test a few of what we call game changing wells he added
earlier on tuesday equinor announced plans to partly power two of its north sea oilfields with floating wind turbines which in turn would help the company cuts its carbon dioxide emissions
