update 1-sanctions unlikely to stop iran oil exports completely - saudi adviser
stavanger norway reuters current sanctions on iran are unlikely to stop iranian oil exports completely a adviser at saudi arabia s energy ministry said on tuesday adding iran would be unable to close the straits of hormuz and bab even partially
speaking at an oil conference in the norwegian city of stavanger ibrahim said iran would be the first to lose out on a move to block those major shipping routes and that any such action would trigger further sanctions on iran
current sanctions are unlikely to stop iranian oil exports completely as almost all experts agree
i mean they will continue to export million barrels per day or so
so closing that strait of hormuz will damage the iranians as much as damaging others he said
iran has said if it can not sell its oil due to pressure then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either threatening to block the strait of hormuz
the amount of oil going through the strait of hormuz is so large
there s more than million barrels a day about two thirds of world maritime oil trade
meaning cutting oil from there will lead to an acute oil shortage and prices will skyrocket muhanna said
is iran able or willing to close completely or even partially the strait of hormuz or bab or both
the answer is no and a really big president donald trump pulled out of a pact between iran and major world powers under which sanctions were lifted in return for tehran accepting curbs on its nuclear programme
the trump administration then announced unilateral plans to restore sanctions against tehran
