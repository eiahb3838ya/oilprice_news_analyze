update 3-popular french environment minister quits in blow to macron
paris reuters french environment minister nicolas hulot resigned on tuesday in frustration over sluggish progress on climate goals and nuclear energy policy dealing a major blow to president emmanuel macron s already tarnished green credentials
hulot a former tv presenter and green activist who consistently scored high in opinion polls quit during a live radio interview following what he called an accumulation of disappointments
i don t want to lie to myself any more or create the illusion that we re facing up to these challenges hulot said on france inter
i have therefore decided to leave the hulot was among macron s first ministerial appointments following his may election victory
his inclusion helped to sustain a green image france had earned months earlier by brokering the paris agreement to combat global greenhouse emissions
but the centrist president has watered down a series of campaign pledges on the environment including a commitment to cut the share of nuclear power in french electricity to percent by and boost renewable energy
those policy shifts have been a repeated source of frustration for hulot
since a honeymoon period they have been accompanied by a sharp slide in macron s ratings which touched new lows after his bodyguard was filmed assaulting demonstrators last month
hulot said he had not informed macron before announcing his resignation
this may not be the right protocol but if i had warned them they might have talked me out of it yet again hulot said
his cabinet portfolio also included energy
government spokesman benjamin griveaux said the cabinet regretted his resignation but also described it as a blow from which we ll recover
i don t understand why he is stepping down when we had many successes in the first year that are to his credit griveaux told bfm television
he didn t win all his battles but that s the way it goes for greenpeace france director julliard said that while macron had made some fine speeches and stood up to president donald trump on climate change he had never turned these words to concrete action at home
there is still no energy transition policy in france julliard said
shares in power utility edf which is on the hook for the cost of decommissioning older nuclear plants surged percent in early trading before settling back to euros at gmt still up percent on monday s close
hulot had also voiced disappointment after macron wavered on a commitment to ban the weedkiller glyphosate sold under monsanto s roundup trademark and failed to prevent total s la mede refinery producing biofuel from imported palm oil linked to deforestation
his announcement came a day after the government promised to relax hunting laws in a move widely seen as an attempt to bolster macron s appeal in rural areas
prime minister edouard philippe said he would discuss the composition of the government with macron following hulot s departure leaving open the possibility of other changes
macron s office sought to attribute the resignation to the frustration even exhaustion of a ministerial novice suddenly confronted with the machinery of government
political and administrative timeframes aren t necessarily as one hopes coming from activism an elysee official said insisting that hulot s deep commitment to environmentalism was evidenced by the government s policy track record
in his radio interview however hulot emphasized the inadequacy of on climate change by france and other nations voicing hope that his exit might provoke deep introspection in our society about the reality of the world
his doubts about remaining in government had grown over the summer as devastating droughts were met with a tepid political response he said
alain juppe a conservative former prime minister and presidential contender said he was impressed by hulot s and by the nobility of his act
beyond the inevitable political buzz i hope this decision encourages us all to think and to change he said on twitter
