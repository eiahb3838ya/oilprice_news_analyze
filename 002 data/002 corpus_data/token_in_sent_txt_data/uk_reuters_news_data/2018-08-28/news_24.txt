column-is china becoming a more price-sensitive exporter of refined fuels?: russell
launceston australia reuters china s refiners increased their output in july to close to million barrels per day bpd but at the same time exports of refined fuels fell to the lowest in four months
these facts may seem contradictory and while there are several issues than can help explain the dynamics perhaps the most compelling is that china appears to be becoming more attuned to market forces for refined products in asia
as is often the case with china s intake and processing of crude oil and its exports of refined products the data is incomplete and in this case the main missing numbers are movements in inventories
inventory data was last released in april so it s hard to know how much of the refinery throughput went into storage tanks as opposed to being exported or consumed domestically
but what is known is that refinery runs totalled million bpd in july a gain of percent from the same month in
in the first seven months of the year china s refineries processed million bpd an increase of percent over the same period last year
however exports of gasoline fell to tonnes in july equivalent to about bpd down from bpd in june and bpd in may
diesel exports fell to million tonnes or about bpd down from bpd in june and bpd in may
in addition to the unknown flows into inventories gasoline and diesel exports may have been affected by chinese refiners getting close to exhausting quotas and cutting back on shipments
it is also possible that the smaller independent refineries exported less because of reduced runs as they battle higher crude oil prices and increased government scrutiny on taxes
chinese domestic consumption may also have risen especially in the agricultural sector given the summer peak demand season
all of these factors can help shed light on the in china s exports of refined fuels but perhaps the best explanation is the movement of prices around the time when july exports would have been arranged
the profit from making a barrel of gasoline in singapore from brent crude the main regional benchmark dropped to its low so far this year of a barrel on july
it had been steadily declining since hitting a peak of a barrel on may meaning that at the time chinese refiners would have been contemplating selling gasoline for exports the incentive to do so was weakening
it s a similar story for diesel with the profit margin or crack for producing a barrel of parts per million diesel from dubai crude dropping to a low of a barrel on june down from on may
the moves in pricing suggest that chinese refiners may have become more price sensitive and therefore less likely to export surplus refined fuels irrespective of the profit gained from doing so
what is also worth noting is that the cracks for both diesel and gasoline later strengthened with diesel rising to a barrel on before slipping slightly to end at on monday
the gasoline crack jumped percent from its july low to a barrel on although it subsequently eased to on monday
the recovery in the profit margins for refined fuels may have come too late to provide a significant boost to china s exports in august
but september should reveal whether china s refiners are indeed becoming more or whether the other factors still play a bigger role
the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters
