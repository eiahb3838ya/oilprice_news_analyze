londoners welcome re-introduction of public drinking-water fountains
london reuters baked by a blazing summer and keen to reduce their use of plastic bottles londoners are welcoming a scheme to fountains across the british capital
four have already been installed and one of them off fashion hotspot carnaby street has been used more than times a month this summer the office of london mayor sadiq khan said on tuesday
now more are planned this year for locations such as windrush square brixton paddington recreation ground guy s hospital in southwark and the natural history museum in kensington
public drinking fountains were common in london as long ago as the victorian era but have long since made way for plastic bottles with the average adult londoner buying more than three a week according to khan s office
water fountains are a simple but effective way to encourage londoners and visitors to ditch plastic bottles and instead refill reusable ones said khan in a statement
some of these are already attracting thousands of visitors a day and city hall are working on plans to secure many more across the mayor s office has worked with the zoological society of london s zsl oneless campaign to secure the locations of the fountains
zsl assessed the site applications on accessibility visibility and footfall to ensure water refills are available for as many people as possible
heather koldewey oneless campaign director and head of marine and freshwater conservation at zsl said there was big demand for the fountains
we were taken aback by the number of applications we received
