epa plans biofuel 'reset' as program misses u.s. congress' targets
new york reuters the environmental protection agency will propose new targets for the final three years of the nation s renewable fuel program in january replacing ambitious goals set by congress with volumes closer to the industry s current output two people familiar with the matter said
the planned reset of the renewable fuel standard is likely to set up a fresh battle between two industries with corn growers wanting the highest possible targets to spur investment and oil companies eyeing the smallest to reduce costs
the standard which expires in was established in to boost the corn belt economy and help wean the country off of fossil fuels
refiners are required to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into gasoline and diesel each year or purchase blending credits from companies that do
oil companies say the policy costs them a fortune
yet it has fallen short of original targets because production has proven more costly and inefficient than expected even with subsidies
the two sources who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the matter said on monday the epa was planning to slash the target to bring it closer to current market realities but added that the agency had not settled on a number
an epa official confirmed the agency is working with stakeholders on a reset proposal and aimed to finalize its plan by november
congress had hoped biofuel production volumes under the standard would hit billion gallons by
but the industry in produced only around billion with advanced biofuels made from things like corn fiber and algae posting the biggest shortfalls
as a result the epa has been forced to ignore the statutory targets in its annual process setting out instead what it views as more realistic and attainable yearly mandates
for the first time the epa wants to officially rewrite the congressional targets for through
the trump administration has tried to reduce compliance costs for refiners drawing the ire of biofuel producers and their legislative backers
oil and agriculture groups said the outcome is crucial
we are going to ask and we expect to see lower volumes across the board derrick morgan a lobbyist for the american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers said in a phone interview
he said the ethanol targets currently at billion gallons a year should be more fluid and based on expected gasoline demand
the ethanol target should be closer to billion gallons he said which is percent of the government s gasoline demand projection
biofuel backers say the program should retain loftier targets in its final years to encourage companies to keep investing in new plants and technology
our goal is simple to keep moving the rfs forward not backward said emily skor chief executive of growth energy a biofuel trade group
