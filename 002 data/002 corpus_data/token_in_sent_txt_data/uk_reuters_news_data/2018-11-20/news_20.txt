update 1-oil markets heading into unprecedented uncertainty - iea's birol
oslo reuters oil markets are entering an unprecedented period of uncertainty due to geopolitical instability and a fragile global economy the head of the international energy agency said on tuesday
concerned about an emerging production overhang similar to the one that led to a price slump in the organisation of the petroleum exporting countries is pushing for a supply cut of million to million barrels per day bpd
the united states restored sanctions targeting iran s oil sector in early november cutting the country s crude exports by close to million bpd from a summer peak
although washington has pledged eventually to halt all of iran s global sales of crude oil for now it has said eight buyers china india south korea japan italy greece taiwan and turkey can continue imports without penalty
the decision on the iranian sanction waivers took some of the players in the market by surprise the iea s fatih birol said in an interview on the sidelines of a conference organised by norwegian energy company equinor
as a result what we see today is that markets are well supplied and the oil price went down by birol said
but the global economy is still going through a very difficult time and is very fragile and we have very thin production capacity left in the world in a world which is becoming more brent crude surged above a barrel in october mainly on worries about supply tightness due to the iran sanctions
but since the waiver announcement prices have fallen on concerns about oversupply as well as a slowdown in global trade
brent fetched around a barrel on tuesday
we are entering an unprecedented period of uncertainty in oil markets birol told the conference
birol reiterated his call on key producers to exercise common sense at opec s policy meeting in december
asked whether the oil price could overheat next year birol said it would depend on three factors
despite the weak shape of the global economy oil demand is still strong spare production capacity is very thin and we do not know what the decision of the key producers in opec in december will be he said
