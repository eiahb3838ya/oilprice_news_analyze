exclusive-chevron granted waiver from u.s. biofuel laws at utah plant -source
new york reuters the environmental protection agency granted oil major chevron corp a hardship waiver from biofuel laws for its utah refinery earlier this year according to a source familiar with the company s operations
chevron which reported a net income of billion in becomes the largest known company to be awarded a hardship waiver from the renewable fuel standard rfs which requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel pool or buy compliance credits from competitors that do
the waivers which have grown significantly under the trump administration have angered farmers who say it hurts demand for ethanol and other biofuels
when an oil company whose net profits surpass the total value of the iowa corn crop claims it is experiencing hardship you know we ve reached a new level of absurdity said geoff cooper ceo of the renewable fuels association
chevron declined to confirm whether it received a small refinery hardship waiver but did say that seeking them can level the playing field
epa has acknowledged that it has granted several small refinery exemptions from the rfs
any chevron refinery not exempted from the rfs would be at a disadvantage in the highly competitive markets where we operate the company said in an emailed statement
the epa did not immediately respond to requests for comment
refineries with a capacity less than can receive waivers from the rfs if they prove compliance would cause them disproportionate hardship
chevron s salt lake city utah plant is
the epa under president donald trump expanded the waiver program awarding exemptions for the calendar year up from in and just seven in epa data shows
the epa has attributed the program s expansion to a lawsuit brought by two oil refiners who challenged the epa s denial of their waiver request
a federal judge ruled the epa was using too narrow of a test to evaluate applications
biofuel backers say the expansion was politically driven by former epa administrator scott pruitt who sought ways to lower compliance costs for refiners
the chevron approval was granted under pruitt the source said
the surge in hardship waivers has pummeled the price for compliance credits some refiners must buy
reuters previously reported that chevron along with exxon mobil corp sought a hardship waiver from biofuel laws
exxon mobil s application status was unclear
