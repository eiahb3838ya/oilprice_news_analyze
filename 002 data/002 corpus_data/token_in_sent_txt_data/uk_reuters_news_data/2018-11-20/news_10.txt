column-oil market readies for new imo regulations: kemp
london reuters global oil markets are adjusting to relatively strong demand for diesel and jet fuel compared to gasoline coupled with the introduction of new bunker fuel regulations at the start of
rising diesel and jet fuel prices at least relative to crude and gasoline are forcing adjustments that should lessen the chance of a severe shortage at the end of next year
futures prices for diesel delivered at new york harbor have moved to a premium of more than per barrel over futures prices for gasoline delivered at the same location
the diesel premium has doubled since the end of september
it is trading at the highest level since and before that both of which were years when diesel consumption was growing much faster than gasoline
refiners have a strong incentive to maximise the production of diesel and jet fuel while minimising output of gasoline and many are adjusting production plans in response
in the united states for example refiners cut gasoline yields by percentage point while boosting yields of jet fuel by point and distillate fuel oil by point in august compared with a year earlier
refiners produced a barrels of middle distillates mostly diesel and jet fuel from every barrels of crude in august the most recent month for which data is available
refiners have rarely squeezed more middle distillate from each barrel of crude they process according to data from the energy information administration eia
chartbook at the same time refiners produced fewer than barrels of gasoline per barrels of crude close to lows petroleum supply monthly eia october
as a result the ratio of distillate to gasoline production is at the highest level since the summer of when oil prices were spiking before the global financial crisis
global diesel consumption has generally been rising faster than gasoline for the last quarter of a century
diesel consumption increased by million barrels per day bpd between and while gasoline was up by just million bpd statistical review of world energy bp
refiners have responded by squeezing more diesel and jet fuel from every barrel mostly at the expense of products such as heavy fuel oil bitumen and asphalt
refiners made almost barrels of diesel and jet fuel from every barrels of crude in up from barrels in according to the eia
over the same period production of residual fuel oil and asphalt declined from nine barrels to fewer than five barrels per petroleum supply annual eia august
the international maritime organization s new regulations on bunker fuels are likely to accelerate the transition to distillate fuel oil and away from heavy fuel oil
from the start of the regulations will require ship owners to start using distillate fuel oil unless they start buying heavy fuel oil or install exhaust gas cleaning systems scrubbers
some analysts have expressed concern that the regulations will create an acute shortage of middle distillates resulting in a surge in diesel and jet fuel prices and pulling up crude oil prices with them
but with prices already starting to adjust there is probably enough flexibility in the system to enable it to meet the rise in middle distillate demand over the next months
experience shows refiners have flexibility to adjust the mix by two to four barrels per barrels of crude and in some cases more in the short term by making straightforward operational changes
for example fluid catalytic cracking units can be operated at reduced severity to cut the production of light hydrocarbons in the gasoline range and increase the number of heavier hydrocarbons in the diesel and jet range
fcc units play a critical role in giving refiners the flexibility to adjust their output mix in response to changes in demand over a matter of months
over longer time horizons refiners have multiple routes to increase the output of diesel by investing in new processing units refinery configurations for maximum conversion to middle distillates chevron
most refiners have been planning to increase their yield of middle distillates for nearly a decade in response to projections of increased diesel demand
the new in the middle east and asia have all been planned to maximise the production of middle distillates for the transport market in anticipation of new imo rules and projected increases in freight demand
on the consumption side price changes will help smooth the adjustment to imo rules with higher diesel prices forcing more fuel efficiency in the freight transportation sector
and the sharp rise in diesel prices relative to gasoline is likely to accelerate the shift away from diesel among european motorists making more fuel available to the shipping sector
by encouraging maximum refinery production and restraining consumption over the next six to nine months the rise in diesel prices should help build stocks and reduce the risk of a price spike in late and
