york reuters a hack on italian oil services firm saipem that crippled more than of the company s computers used a variant of the notorious shamoon virus saipem said a development that links the case to a massive attack in on saudi aramco
the cyber attack hit servers based in the middle east india aberdeen and in a limited way italy through a variant of shamoon malware the company said in a statement on wednesday
work is under way in a gradual and controlled manner to fully restore operations after the attack it said
the shamoon virus was used in some of the most damaging cyber attacks in history starting in when it crippled tens of thousands of computers at saudi aramco and rasgas co ltd in the middle east attacks that cybersecurity researchers said were conducted on behalf of iran
saudi aramco is saipem s biggest customer
the attack crippled between and servers and up to personal computers out of a total of about saipem machines the company s head of digital and innovation mauro piasere told reuters

former defense secretary leon panetta has said the hack of saudi aramco was probably the most destructive cyber attack on a private business
shamoon went dormant until it resurfaced in late in a series of middle east attacks that continued through early
it went dark for a long time and it seems to be back said eric chien senior researcher at cybersecurity firm symantec
the question is whether any others were affected by security researchers widely believe that people working on behalf of the iranian government were behind previous shamoon attacks which tehran strongly denies
imagery was found in the code researchers have said
officials in iran could not be reached for comment
