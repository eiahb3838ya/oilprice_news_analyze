opec says it replaced iran oil loss, sees lower 2019 demand
london dec reuters opec on wednesday said it replaced a drop in iranian exports as sanctions resumed and lowered the forecast of demand for its crude underlining its challenge to prevent a glut building even after last week s decision to trim output
in a monthly report opec said its oil output fell by only barrels per day month on month to million bpd in november despite president donald trump s reimposition of sanctions on iran as saudi arabia pumped at a record rate
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries also said demand for its crude would fall to million bpd less than predicted last month as rivals pump more and a slowing economy curbs demand growth
opec and allies last week agreed to return to supply cuts in pledging to lower output by million bpd
