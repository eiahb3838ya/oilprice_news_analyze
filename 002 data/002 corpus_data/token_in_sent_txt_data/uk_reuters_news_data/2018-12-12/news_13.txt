update 1-brazil approves wto action over india sugar
adds comments from brazil s cane industry group by marcelo teixeira sao paulo dec reuters the brazilian government approved consultations at the world trade organization regarding subsidies it says india gives to cane producers and sugar exporters brazil s trade ministry said
brazil said it has decided to start a formal action at the wto after failing to receive enough information from india following letters it sent to the indian government seeking clarifications on sugar policies
the suspicion is that indian domestic support to farmers and its subsidies to sugar exports caused significant impacts in the sugar market in a context of falling prices and decreasing production in the main centers brazil china and thailand the brazilian trade ministry said in a written statement late on tuesday
india is expected to surpass brazil as the world s largest sugar producer in the current global sugar crop with output around million tonnes while brazil s production is expected to fall almost million tonnes to below million tonnes
brazil said india s government policy to guarantee a minimum price for cane to farmers has caused production to surge
it says this policy combined with subsidies to sugar transportation is allowing the country to ship excess sugar production abroad
sugar prices in new york reached a low in september
prices have recovered a bit since then but are still barely covering production costs for most companies
as a result brazilian mills sharply reduced their sugar production in the current season diverting cane to ethanol instead and leaving sugar equipment idle
brazil s cane industry group unica said it hopes other sugar producing countries such as australia would join the brazilian government action at the wto as interested parties
it said indian policies led brazilian mills to lose around billion in revenue considering lost sales and sugar price falls in the season alone
unica estimates that losses worldwide reached around billion dollars
this is the second wto case related to sugar that brazil starts this year
in october it had opened consultations against tariffs implemented by china
unica s director eduardo le√£o told reuters that a meeting between brazilian and chinese negotiators regarding that consultation is scheduled for in geneva
