failure to agree climate deal rules would be suicidal -un chief
katowice poland reuters failure by countries to agree rules on implementing the paris climate agreement aimed at curbing global warming would be suicidal united nations antonio guterres said on wednesday
guterres told delegates from over countries meeting in the polish city of katowice that they had less than three days to find the political will to reach difficult compromises sacrifices and common ground needed for a deal
failing here in katowice would send a disastrous message to those who stand ready to shift to a green economy he said
to waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change
it would not only be immoral it would be three years to the day after the paris climate accord was adopted by over countries delegates in the polish city are still grappling with how the accord will be implemented
this slow progress after more than a week of negotiations prompted michal kurtyka the polish president of the talks to tell delegates time was precious and they needed to find wordings which were acceptable to all
environmental activists and some developing countries have also raised concern that the rule book could fall short of pushing countries towards curbing their emissions to meet the paris targets
the clock is ticking
while we spend time debating texts and demanding their implementation the planet outside is deteriorating
species are becoming extinct
habitats disappearing
emissions piling up brazilian environment minister edson duarte said
guterres said a recent report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change acknowledged what global warming beyond degrees will mean for billions of people especially those who live in small island states
the report outlined a catastrophic future if no action was taken by countries immediately he said adding that the window of opportunity was closing
the paris agreement aims to restrict warming to well below two degrees celsius fahrenheit above times
this may sound like a dramatic appeal but it is exactly this a dramatic appeal guterres said
