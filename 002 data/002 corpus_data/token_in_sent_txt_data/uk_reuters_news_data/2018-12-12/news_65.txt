update 1-iata trims airline industry profit view, sees rebound in 2019
adds details quote by tom miles geneva dec reuters global airlines will see rising profit growth and record carbon dioxide emissions next year as strong demand offsets cost pressures that trimmed profitability in the international air transport association iata said on wednesday
industry profits are expected to rise to billion in from billion in iata said
the aviation industry is on a more solid financial footing than at any time in its history iata director general and ceo alexandre de juniac told reporters at iata s annual media day in geneva
iata chief economist brian pearce said iata did not expect a recession ahead but there was a lot to worry about with trade protectionism and uncertainty around brexit although even the most chaotic outcome of britain s exit from the european union was expected merely to slow not stop growth
the tariff wars are a worry for us
it s actually though really just the latter stages of a decade of protectionism actually since the global financial crisis we ve seen cross border trade growing at a much slower pace than we saw in the years of globalisation pearce said
we ve seen a lot of governments effectively restricting cross border trade by soft protectionism
we re now seeing it more explicitly with tariff wars
we would certainly hope that governments would see sense that it s a game that it doesn t benefit anybody to restrict global margins would continue to be under pressure from wage pressures and costs although fuel prices had fallen and airlines around the world had seen costs rising he said
investors return on capital was expected to stabilise at percent this year and next
although that would be the lowest since it would be above the cost of capital the returns that investors could earn by putting their money elsewhere
governments needed to do better and support competitiveness and policies de juniac said
the industry was approaching an infrastructure crisis and recovering from a european air traffic management mess of epic proportions
carbon dioxide emissions which were consistently below million tonnes until will hit million tonnes in and million tonnes in iata said
the says relentless rises in carbon dioxide emissions are the most important factor in causing catastrophic climate change
iata originally forecast profits of more than billion but cut that back to billion in june
