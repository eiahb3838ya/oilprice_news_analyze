update 2-norway tells three drillers to fix oil rig lifeboat safety
adds odfjell drilling comment oslo dec reuters norway s petroleum safety authority psa has told transocean maersk drilling and odfjell drilling to beef up emergency evacuation equipment and procedures on offshore oil rigs it said on wednesday
drilling rigs are equipped with enclosed lifeboats that can be dropped into the ocean in an emergency and owners must meet a series of technical and operational requirements for how to plan and carry out evacuations
all the audits identified a from the regulations
this was the same for maersk transocean and odfjell psa said adding the firms had been asked to explain how they would fix the shortcomings
the psa has now received a response from each company but this does not describe how the breach of the regulations is to be corrected it said in a statement
the audits comprised nine rigs each at maersk and transocean and four at odfjell
maersk drilling a subsidiary of the
group said it needed more consultations with the psa before deciding on the measures which might require additional investments
we are going to continue the dialogue to understand their and to clarify what solutions have to be implemented jakob korsgaard head of maersk drilling operations in norway told reuters
depending on the outcome it might require modifications or upgrades of our rigs but it s too early to say he added
odfjell drilling said they disagreed with the psa s conclusion
our opinion has been that we operate in accordance with current regulations eirik knudsen the company s vice president for corporate finance and investor relations said in an email to reuters
we are now working to understand psa s basis for notification of order he added
to operate on the norwegian continental shelf each drilling rig must have acknowledgement of compliance aoc which is awarded by the psa
while the regulator could ultimately revoke an aoc if technical conditions and safety management systems don t meet requirements it was premature to discuss such measures a psa spokesman said
transocean did not immediately respond to reuters requests by phone and email for comment
the psa gave the companies a march deadline to fix the shortcomings
