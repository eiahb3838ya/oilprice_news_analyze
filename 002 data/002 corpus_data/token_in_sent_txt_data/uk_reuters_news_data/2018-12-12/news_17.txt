germany backs higher compensation to speed up 'green' power grid push
frankfurt dec reuters germany s cabinet backed plans on wednesday to increase compensation paid to land owners affected by the construction of new electricity grids needed to carry green power produced in the remote north to industrial areas in the south
the law expected to be approved by both houses of parliament in late april aims to speed up construction work by adding million euros to the million euros million agreed
this is an important milestone for improving the chances of success for the energy transition and network expansion said economy minister peter altmaier
the construction of new networks mainly carrying power from north to south is years behind schedule because of germany s federal structure and citizens opposition to new infrastructure on their doorsteps
altmaier has campaigned hard to persuade citizens the grids are necessary to ensure the deployment of wind and solar power meets with the equivalent transport
without new and stronger cables power produced by wind is often wasted because it can not yet be stored
networks that have served local purposes need revamping and new cables over long distances must be laid
an increase in german offshore wind power is turning supply routes upside down as will a rise in electric mobility
previously power was generated near industry in large plants for example nuclear reactors
power produced from north sea wind farms that is needed in bavaria requires thousands of kilometres of new power lines while localised and increased use from electric vehicles will also change power flows
germany aims to produce percent of its power from renewable sources by up from just over a third currently cutting out carbon emissions from fossil fuels burning
the advancement of transmission of power and the digitisation of lower voltage local grids will be financed via fees that are shared by consumers
