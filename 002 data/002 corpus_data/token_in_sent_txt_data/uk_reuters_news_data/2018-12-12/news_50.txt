mckenna said canada was addressing such concerns
we are in a transition and transitions are not going to happen from one day to the next
people are still driving cars and even in a scenario we are still going to be using oil and gas but moving as quickly as we all can towards cleaner sources she said
she said canada was investing in renewables and cited efforts in the canadian province of alberta which relies heavily on oil and gas but has introduced a carbon tax and aims to impose a limit on emissions from oil sands
