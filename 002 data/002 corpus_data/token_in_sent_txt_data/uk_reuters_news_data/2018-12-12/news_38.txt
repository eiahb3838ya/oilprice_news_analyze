update 1-u.s. probe cites 'ineffective' safeguard in husky oil refinery blast
adds company comment paragraphs by erwin seba houston dec reuters an ineffective safeguard failed to prevent an explosive mixing of air and fuel at a husky energy refinery in superior wisconsin leading to a blast and fire in the plant s unit in april a industrial safety group said on wednesday
air seeped through a hole in a valve within a fluidic catalytic cracking unit fccu the chemical safety board csb said causing an april explosion that led to a massive fire and a evacuation of residents living within miles of the plant
the board said people sought medical treatment after the blast including working at the refinery
the plant was undergoing maintenance at the time
husky according to the csb had only considered a failure of the valve when locked open not a failure when it was closed according to an updated report the board presented of its investigation at a meeting in superior
the failures leading to the superior refinery explosion were similar to those that caused a explosion in an fccu at a torrance california refinery then owned by exxon mobil corp
exxon sold the refinery to pbf energy in
prior to both incidents the process hazard analyses identified scenarios in which hydrocarbons flowed into the air side of the fccu and vice versa due to a failure of the spent catalyst slide valve scsv but the safeguards listed to protect against those scenarios were ineffective the board said
husky did not dispute the csb s finding and will continue to work with the board while it conducts its own investigation into the explosion said spokesman mel duvall
the csb s investigation is important to understanding what happened duvall said
we are also continuing with our own the csb created by the clean air act has no regulatory or enforcement authority but is charged with determining the causes of chemical plant explosions and fires and making recommendations to government and industry
given the similarities between these two incidents the csb will be examining areas of further improvement that need to be taken by industry the board said
fccus use a fine silica catalyst in high heat to make gasoline from gas oil and the passage of the catalyst over the slide valve at the superior refinery wore a hole in it
a mixture of air and hydrocarbon within the unit can easily find an ignition source in the degree fahrenheit celsius operating temperature of the fccu
while we don t expect to resume normal operations at the refinery until we remain committed to our employees and the community duvall said
duvall said the company is reviewing alternatives to hydrogen flouride as it prepares to rebuild the refinery for restart in
