update 3-pompeo says cia still investigating killing of khashoggi
washington reuters in a rare break with president donald trump the senate voted on wednesday to move ahead with a resolution to end military support for the saudi coalition in the war in yemen and lawmakers vowed to push for sanctions against the kingdom in the new year
eleven of trump s fellow republicans joined democrats to provide the votes needed to advance the war powers resolution in the chamber
the vote paved the way for debate and a vote on involvement in a conflict that has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians many of them young children and left millions more at risk of starvation and death by disease
the nearly unprecedented break the republicans made from trump was largely symbolic because the house of representatives is not expected to take the matter up this year
trump has threatened a veto
but backers of the resolution said it sent an important message that lawmakers are unhappy with the humanitarian disaster in yemen and angry about the lack of a strong response to the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi at a saudi consulate in turkey
republican and democratic lawmakers also vowed to keep pushing after the new congress take office in january for further tough action against saudi arabia including legislation to impose human rights sanctions and opposition to weapons sales
if you want to buy our weapons there are certain things you have to accept
how you use them matters republican senator lindsey graham told a news conference
the individual the crown prince is so toxic so tainted so flawed that i can t ever see myself doing business with saudi arabia unless there s a change there said graham generally a close trump ally in the senate
republicans will hold a slightly larger majority in the new senate but democrats will take control of the house of representatives increasing the chances of sanctions legislation passing
the trump administration had urged congress not to oppose fuelling targeting help and other support for the coalition as it battles the houthis shi ite muslim fighters viewed by yemen s neighbours as agents of iran
earlier on wednesday secretary of state mike pompeo defended the administration s handling of khashoggi s killing
pompeo repeated his assertion there was no direct evidence linking crown prince mohammed bin salman to the killing of khashoggi in istanbul despite a cia assessment it was likely he ordered the killing
riyadh initially denied knowledge of khashoggi s disappearance then offered contradictory explanations including that he was killed in a rogue operation
trump condemned the murder but has stood by the saudi crown prince
he s the leader of saudi arabia
they ve been a very good ally trump told reuters on tuesday in an oval office interview
central intelligence agency director gina haspel briefed leaders of the house of representatives behind closed doors about the killing
after the classified meeting house members said they had not heard anything to change their minds about khashoggi s death
democratic representative eliot engel likely the next chairman of the foreign affairs committee when democrats take control of the house in january said he intended to hold hearings starting early next year on all aspects of saudi behaviour and the relationship
saudi arabia s an important partner but i don t think we can simply look the other way when things happen and talk about business as usual engel said
pompeo and defence secretary jim mattis who held a separate briefing for the entire senate are due to discuss saudi arabia with the entire house on thursday
but several lawmakers have urged that congress keep the yemen conflict separate from anger over the killing of khashoggi a resident and washington post columnist
they view saudi arabia as an essential counterweight in the middle east to iran of close ally israel
white house officials see saudi support as a linchpin for an peace plan yet to be unveiled by the trump administration
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu told reporters on wednesday in jerusalem that saudi arabia s role in the middle east must be taken into account in responding to khashoggi s horrific fate
if saudi arabia were to be destabilised the world would be destabilised netanyahu told foreign reporters speaking in english
