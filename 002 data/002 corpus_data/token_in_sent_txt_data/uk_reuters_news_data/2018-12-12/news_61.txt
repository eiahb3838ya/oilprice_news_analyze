rpt-mexico president's pemex plans rattle faith of debt-holders
repeats tuesday story with no changes to text by stefanie eschenbacher mexico city dec reuters mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador s declaration of war on economics has shaken investors holding petroleos mexicanos bonds fueling concern about the future of the state oil company he has pledged to revive
ratings agencies and three managers spoken to by reuters at funds that either hold pemex paper or recently sold it said proposals floated by the government to build a new refinery and give the state a bigger role in the oil industry could put fresh strain on the company which must pay back almost a third of its debt in the next three years
fitch and moody s have in recent weeks flagged concerns about pemex s billion of financial debt the highest of any state oil company in latin america
under threat said shamaila khan director of emerging market debt at alliancebernstein which manages billion in assets and invests in pemex is the company s investment grade rating
they are moving in that direction khan said citing the plans to build a new refinery and to make pemex do more exploration as risks
if the rating goes investors including many pension and sovereign wealth funds whose mandates stipulate they must hold assets of investment grade quality may have to dump pemex debt making it harder for the firm to raise capital
pemex did not respond to request for comment for this story
the finance ministry declined to comment
the company which also has billion in pension obligations said in its last quarterly report to that its negative cashflow could affect its ability to operate and pay off debts
it acknowledged a downgrade was a possibility and said external auditors raised doubts about the ability of the company to continue as a business citing recurrent net losses negative working capital and negative equity
energy minister rocio nahle said pemex had been driven into the ground by the policies of previous governments and that it would be saved by a new administration focused on increasing output
how do we think we will pay the debt
by increasing production she said in an interview with aristegui noticias on tuesday saying predecessors had sold assets but kept on increasing pemex borrowing
lopez obrador who took office on is already entangled in a dispute with bondholders behind a new billion mexico city airport that the leftist said he would cancel on the grounds it was tainted by corruption
the move sent tremors through mexican financial markets hitting the peso and prompting warnings by ratings agency fitch about pemex
i sold my last holdings in pemex a couple of weeks ago due to the whole populistic approach he had to the airport said dorthe nielsen an emerging market debt manager in zurich at gam which manages assets worth billion swiss francs
created in with the expropriation of foreign oil assets pemex became a symbol of mexican ingenuity at the outset of a golden age of economic growth and stability that lasted into the
corruption mismanagement and declining output have all since taken a heavy toll on the company
lopez obrador who harked back to the era known as the mexican miracle in his inaugural speech has threatened to undo what he calls a energy overhaul that opened the oil and gas industry to private capital
pitched by the last government as a fix for falling production the reform also made it easier for pemex to team up with other firms
however output is still declining
on sunday lopez obrador announced tenders in march for the new refinery in the southern state of tabasco
he also plans to upgrade existing refineries and expand drilling commissioned by pemex
he did not give details of how the projects would be financed but said government spending on pemex would increase by billion in the national budget due to be presented on
deputy finance minister arturo herrera has said pemex would have to reassign funds if it were to pay for the new refinery
nielsen at gam said if pemex did not start selling assets balance sheet pressure would intensify
a loss of investment grade she added would be a fitch and standard poor s rate pemex s foreign currency debt while moody s puts it at one notch above junk
nymia almeida senior vice president for corporate ratings at moody s in mexico said support from the mexican government was helping the already very low rating by six notches
the rating would not be that great if it weren t for the consideration of the implicit support from the government she said adding that the company owed billion in and another billion in
on top of this they are going to spend more money with the new the yield on pemex s september issue has spiked more than basis points since just before the july election to bid at around percent
while falling oil prices have contributed investors say lopez obrador s policies have aggravated the
audra stundziaite a senior credit analyst at hermes investment management said pemex was facing many of the same challenges as brazil s petroleo brasileiro did three years ago when it lost investment grade
nielsen said unless lopez obrador comes up with something much more that s allowing the company to do joint ventures or bring in partners there s no bright reporting by stefanie eschenbacher additional reporting by marianna parraga ana isabel martinez and michael o boyle editing by dave graham and rosalba o brien
