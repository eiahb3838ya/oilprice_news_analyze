exclusive-conoco moves to sell north sea oilfields - sources
london reuters oil major conocophillips is preparing to sell its north sea fields as the company focuses on shale operations in its home market industry and banking sources said
the disposal of conoco s north sea assets after more than years in the british offshore basin could fetch as much as billion but it was unclear how much of the portfolio would be put up for sale the three sources said
conoco declined to comment
the company has yet to launch a formal process or appoint a bank but executives from conoco have spoken in recent weeks to a number of north sea operators and bankers to gauge the appetite for the sale one of the sources said
the assets include a percent stake in the west shetlands region s clair field which its operator bp says is the largest undeveloped oil and gas resource in the uk north sea
the clair ridge project is expected to begin production this year according to bp
other fields include holdings in the britannia and hubs
conoco s production in the uk north sea reached barrels of oil equivalent per day in its annual report said
the company tried to sell some of its north sea assets in but the process failed the sources added
conoco is the latest major oil company seeking to exit the north sea as production in the ageing basin declines other areas become more competitive and costs for dismantling ageing infrastructure weigh
conoco earlier this year said it would cut some jobs in britain more than a quarter of its uk workforce
