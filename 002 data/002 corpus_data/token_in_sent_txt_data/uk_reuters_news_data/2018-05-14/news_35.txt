former chief of vietnam's state energy firm loses bid to overturn jail term
hanoi may reuters vietnam s official jailed in decades lost his bid on monday to set aside a sentence for financial irregularities when he was chairman of state energy firm petrovietnam his lawyer said
a court in the country upheld the sentence for former politburo member dinh la thang who was arrested and tried in a crackdown on graft mismanagement and nepotism that felled many officials
the hanoi people s high court rejected an appeal by thang against a january trial verdict that held him guilty of economic mismanagement at a power plant overseen by petrovietnam
i am very disappointed with the result of the trial because they didn t look carefully into all the details i presented the lawyer dao huu dang told reuters by telephone
state media this month blamed losses of billion dong million on thang saying he illegally assigned an incompetent subsidiary of the company to build the plant instead of finding a competent contractor by a tender process
in a separate case in march thang received an jail term on the same charges of deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management
at that trial thang was prosecuted over losses of up to billion dong or million in a petrovietnam investment in ocean commercial joint stock bank forcibly taken over in by the state bank of vietnam after it suffered heavy losses
thang will also appeal against the term his lawyer said
if that term is also upheld the sentences will run successively for a total of years in prison
another petrovietnam official trinh xuan thanh withdrew an appeal against the life sentence he received in the same case at the january trial his lawyer said
last week the communist party of vietnam said that thanh whom germany has said was kidnapped from berlin in scenes reminiscent of the cold war withdrew his appeal because of health conditions
his lawyer nguyen van quynh said thanh did not have any health issues ahead of the appeal trial
