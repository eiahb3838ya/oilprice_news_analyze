update 3-portugal's edp shares leap as investors bet on higher bid
reuters shares in portuguese utility edp jumped as much as percent on monday to trade above the price of a bid by china three gorges indicating investors think the billion offer is an opening gambit that could lead to a higher or rival bid
the gains also show investors think there is little that could stop a bid as the european union has limited power to block one and the portuguese government says it has no objections despite a call from its communist allies to renationalize edp
edp shares rose as high as euros above china three gorges ctg euros per share bid which represented a premium of less than percent on edp s friday closing price
the stock closed percent higher at euros
the deal proposed late on friday values edp at billion euros billion excluding the percent stake the chinese utility already owns
ctg could not be reached for comment but a source familiar with the situation said the bid was a move to deter other utilities from making a bid
the source also said edp considered the offer too low and was likely to hold a board meeting this week to review it
a banking source familiar with the matter ruled out any eu utilities launching a or coming forward as a white knight with an alternative proposal but expected edp would negotiate with ctg and push for a better price and a premium
ctg has a lot of room for maneuver and if there is a price war they will do it said a second banker close to the matter but not directly involved with it
he added ctg was to keep edp as a portuguese company listed in lisbon
bloomberg reported edp was poised to reject the bid on the grounds that it undervalued the firm
analysts say ctg s price is low compared with other recent chinese bids for european energy assets
the offer price is too low to be successful portuguese investment bank caixabi said in a note
european utilities lobby eurelectric s chief kristian ruby said he was not surprised by ctg s move and expected to see more such bids as china pursues eu electricity infrastructure assets
ollagnier global head of resources at accenture saw the bid as part of china s one belt one road strategy under which it wants to reverse the direction of the investment flows along the old silk road trading route
china knows it will face local resistance about strategic assets but clearly this is a strategy and we will see progress in the coming years he said
ctg and another chinese state company cnic together hold percent of edp shares
with full control of edp and its renewables unit edpr ctg would become a top european renewables player with a large presence in the united states and brazil
but other shareholders may balk at being
funds holding major edp stakes include capital research with percent masaveu herrero with percent blackrock with percent mudabala investment with percent and capital world with percent thomsonreuters data showed
qatar and norway s sovereign wealth funds also each hold over two percent
jp morgan said ctg s offer was too low to achieve full control of a business providing a strategic footprint in renewables
it expects management and minorities to demand a higher price
edp and other shareholders so far have not commented
paulo rosa a trader at go bulling brokerage in porto said edp s share price jump indicated competing bids could emerge
last year reuters reported that spain s gas natural had approached edp about a possible merger which was subsequently ruled out by the two companies
france s engie also reportedly considered a bid although edp denied there had been talks
a bid from a utility could face more government resistance as private firms may want to cut jobs to boost profitability
while a takeover of edp may need clearance from competition authorities in some of the countries in which edp and edpr operate the eu can do little to stop it
the european commission has drafted rules to block foreign takeovers of strategic firms but there is no unanimity on the proposal which is currently being discussed by the european parliament and member states
with a separate chinese firm state grid corporation of china sgcc owning percent of portugal s state power network ren china is also circumventing eu unbundling legislation which bans utilities from owning grids
more than a decade ago eu utilities were forced to split off their power grid units in order to make them more accessible to all power generators
in recent years sgcc has built up a web of minority stakes in southern european grid operators including ren italy s snam and greece s admie and sources told reuters this month that state grid was in talks to buy a percent stake in german grid operator
the eu has so far not had to consider how to rule on power production and distribution being reunited under a foreign shareholder
the european commission s competition and trade spokespeople declined to comment
for brussels to intervene there would need to be dumping or an abuse of monopoly said nicolas goldberg of colombus consulting
french power industry consultant thibault laconde said ctg s move was bound to sharpen tensions over international trade
it raises the question of reciprocity
a move in the opposite direction would not be possible he said
