update 3-with glut almost gone, opec still cuts more than oil pact demands
london reuters a global oil glut has been virtually eliminated figures published by opec showed on monday thanks to an pact to cut supplies that has been in place since january and due to rising global demand
despite this opec s latest report said producers were cutting more than required under the deal while producers not party to the agreement such as shale companies were starting to face constraints on future output
saudi arabia the world s biggest oil exporter and de facto leader of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries told opec it cut output in april to its lowest level since the supply deal began in january
the opec report said oil inventories in oecd industrialised nations in march fell to million barrels above the average down from million barrels above the average in january
the oil market was underpinned in april by renewed geopolitical issues tightening product inventories and robust global demand opec said in its report
the deal between opec russia and other producers has helped oil prices rise percent since it took effect
oil reached a barrel on monday the highest since november after the opec report was published
the main goal of the supply deal was to reduce excess oil stocks to the average
but oil ministers have since said other metrics should be considered such as oil industry investment suggesting they are in no hurry to end supply cuts
indeed the report showed opec for now is cutting more supply than the group has pledged under the pact
opec output rose by just barrels per day bpd to million bpd in april according to figures opec collects from secondary sources
that is roughly bpd less than the amount opec says the world needs from the group this year
figures reported directly from opec members showed even deeper declines in production
venezuela whose output has plunged due to an economic crisis told opec its production fell to million bpd in april believed to be the lowest in decades
top exporter saudi arabia told opec it cut output by bpd to million bpd which is the lowest since the supply cut deal began based on figures riyadh reports to the group
strong growth in demand due to a robust world economy has helped remove the glut
opec slightly raised its estimate of growth in world demand this year to million bpd
the higher crude prices that have followed have prompted growth in rival supply and a flood of shale output
opec expects supply to expand by million bpd this year which is higher than the growth in global demand
but opec forecast headwinds to future growth such as the slow place of oil industry investment and an expected dip next year in investment in shale also known as tight oil
tight oil production is increasingly faced with costly logistical constraints in terms of outtake capacity from production sites opec said
adding to the impact of cuts the decision to withdraw from an international nuclear deal with opec member iran and to renew sanctions has raised concerns about iranian oil exports helping drive prices higher
opec signalled the group and its allies were ready to step in should geopolitical developments impact supply
saudi arabia said last week it was ready to offset any shortage but would not act alone
opec as always stands ready to support oil market stability together with oil producing nations participating in the declaration of cooperation opec said using its name for the pact on supply curbs
