exclusive-saudi aramco trading arm atc sells first us oil to united arab emirates -sources
delhi reuters saudi oil producer aramco s trading arm has begun supplying condensate an crude oil to the united arab emirates uae four people with direct knowledge of the matter said on monday underlining the giant firm s global ambitions
the sale marks aramco trading company s atc first crude spot trade the people said with atc tapping aramco s motiva enterprises unit in the united states as a supply source for two shipments to the uae
aramco sells almost all its crude under contracts but decided last year to trade in crude in the spot market
for the uae trades a first shipment of million barrels bbl of condensate aboard the tanker astra was unloaded at ruwais on may according to the sources and shipping data on thomson reuters eikon
all the sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak to media
motiva has also chartered the tanker south sea to ship about million bbl of condensate from the gulf to ruwais in may for about million one shipping source said
both vessels are suezmax tankers with capacities from deadweight tonnes named after the suez canal as they are able to transit the canal fully laden
as of may the south sea was docked at corpus christi in texas shipping data on thomson reuters eikon showed
motiva which operates a refinery at port arthur texas and atc did not respond to requests for comment
while the shipments from the united states are a first the move fits into a strategy outlined by aramco executives last month
atc has started supplying some condensate from west to the east
it started only a few weeks back slowly but we will have to make sure that there is an economic sense for us for crude trading saudi aramco chief executive officer amin nasser told reuters speaking on the sidelines of a conference in april
nasser said atc had been focusing on crude oil processing arrangements at refineries with spare capacity which are mainly located in europe
but more atc trades with oil are set to follow
motiva is still looking for ships to move oil to the east the shipping source said as price differentials between crude and international crude make such trades profitable
earlier this month atc was also one of the successful bidders in a tender issued by the abu dhabi national oil company adnoc to buy condensate for delivery in july to september the sources said
adnoc bought million barrels of condensate in the tender with the bulk of the supplies coming from the united states a source familiar with the matter said
abdulla salem al dhaheri director marketing sales trading at adnoc told reuters by tendering our condensate we are able to diversify our supply and achieve better commercial value
for example we are able to take advantage of arbitrage cargoes from long distances that have delivered adnoc more value and higher he added that adnoc now buys condensate from various suppliers
adnoc started importing oil in the second half of last year after a diplomatic row with qatar
atc is also looking to extend its trading operations in asia
atc s ceo ibrahim told reuters last month it plans to handle crude in asia through its singapore office in the third quarter of this year and aims to boost its volumes for trading crude and refined products globally to million barrels per day bpd by up from negligible amounts currently
buainain said his company mostly handles crude and has traded very small saudi crude volumes in processing deals in return for refined products
