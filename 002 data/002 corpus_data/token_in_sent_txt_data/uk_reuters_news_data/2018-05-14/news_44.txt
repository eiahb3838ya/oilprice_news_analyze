insight-china's night-owl retail investors leverage up to dominate oil futures trade
beijing reuters as pm approaches every weekday night in china a small army of individual investors from around the country log onto trading apps on their mobile phones and laptops
wall street may be about to open but these night owls are interested in trading something much closer to home the new shanghai crude oil futures contracts isc that were launched in late march
armed with risky loans from online firms or digging into their own savings they threaten to play an outsized role in the new market which has got off to a roaring start
it is not for the fainthearted one contract of barrels costs about yuan and traders are required to place a deposit as much as yuan before they are allowed to trade
on average volume between pm and midnight accounts for almost percent of daily turnover equivalent to about million barrels of oil worth more than billion yuan
and executives of online lending platforms managers at major brokerages and traders interviewed by reuters all said that most of the orders in that period come from retail investors and a lot of it involves borrowed money
their dominance is a reflection of the interest among china s burgeoning middle class for investments in the country s vast commodities market many of the crude oil traders also dabble in other commodities such as iron ore and steel
this is especially the case after the authorities in recent years succeeded in damping down speculative activity in stocks and in real estate
it is also a sign of the kind of mania that is not only for the individual investors who can quickly lose a lot of money borrowed on margin but also for the prospects of china s oil futures market
the retail investors can exaggerate price swings they tend to close out positions every day for example to avoid holding costs and the market could lose liquidity quickly if a prompts a sudden outflow of their money
liquidity measured by open interest hit lots equivalent to million barrels last thursday a record and almost double levels at the start of may after washington withdrew from the iran nuclear deal and renewed sanctions on the oil exporter
that does suggest a pick up in interest from institutional investors in recent days
but uncertainty about the role of retail players could in the longer run deter foreign institutional investors potentially undermining china s attempts to become a major force in oil trading which so far has been seen largely as a success
the market is also open for two short sessions between and but the retail crowd prefers the night time because many of them have day jobs and because they can also trade the shanghai contracts alongside the established benchmarks for crude oil futures london s brent lco and wti in the united states cl
the shanghai market closes at but volume drops off after midnight as the traders head off to bed
the crude markets tend to have more volatility at night providing an opportunity for us to trade said lv peng a investor based in zhengzhou a city in central henan province
domestic retail investors often find cues for trading from international oil peng a data analyst at a hedge fund says he has on average been doing between and trades each week and has been up most nights until since the launch on march
he uses his own money
but that is not the case with a lot of the other night traders
for example a bank employee in nanjing in southern jiangsu province who would only provide his surname liu said he piled on trades in the nascent market with money borrowed from online financing platforms
but liu who is in his lost million yuan in the first two weeks after his bets that prices would rally went against him
instead prices fell percent
he said he concluded that retail investors are not able to make money in the crude futures market paid back his loans and quit the market feeling burned out
the shanghai futures exchange said in an emailed statement that investors should not use loans which have been banned by the government to trade their products and they should be aware of the risks of doing so
market regulator china securities regulatory commission csrc did not respond to a request for comment
small investors have made the crude futures trading market more active said xu wei head of derivatives trading at software developer fuxing online software co which has around retail investors using its product to trade oil futures
at the same time they are less experienced in the market and could easily lose all they still lenders say that if they weren t providing margin financing the contract wouldn t have had as successful a start
we provided almost two thirds of total volume contributed by retail investors
imagine what would have happened to the market if we pulled out said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity at a lender called findoil
his clients traded a total of to barrels of crude each night he said
that equates to lots each
but with investors borrowing ten times the money they re putting down there is a real danger that some will lose their shirts
with that kind of leverage a small move in oil crude futures could be very costly for an investor if they were on the wrong side said a client manager at a broker in central henan province
gold and forex management co is one of many firms advertising online as an asset management firm offering loans
sources at loan companies say interest rates can be as high as percent a day
the company has more than retail customers who needed help paying the deposit
their combined deposit reached as high as million yuan at one point a company source said
still there is one person who won t be embarking on any more trading adventures anytime soon
that s liu the nanjing banker
he said he can handle the financial losses and his wife though angry did not blame him
from now on though he s going to invest in less exciting treasury bonds and is sticking to doing it during daylight hours
