opec secretary general worried about trade war effect on china and india, oil demand's 'bright spots'
opec secretary general mohammed barkindo is largely optimistic over prospects of achieving a balanced oil market in
but if one thing keeps him awake at night it the trade war potential to disrupt growth in major asian markets that import the highest proportion of the world crude
we are concerned with the lingering trade disputes barkindo told cnbc hadley gamble while at the atlantic council global energy forum in abu dhabi sunday
the synchronized growth that we have witnessed since the last global financial crisis that has taken this long was also due largely to the growth in international trade
any measures that may impact or constrain trade may likely impact on growth and by extension on demand for energy
at the moment outside the china and india remain the brightest spots in terms of demand for energy
so you can imagine our concern of the lingering negotiations
