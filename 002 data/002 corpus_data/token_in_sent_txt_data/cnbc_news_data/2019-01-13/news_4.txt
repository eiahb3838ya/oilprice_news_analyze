he then mentioned the performance of the largest producer that partnered with the cartel on cuts russia has started slower than i like but they started and i am sure as they did as in they catch up and be a positive contributor to the market
opec members along with several other countries in december agreed on output cuts totaling million barrels per day in order to stem a sinking market and support their own economies
opec plus refers to the group cooperation with the producers like russia and other former soviet states as well as mexico
russia was more reluctant to cut its output as its growth is heavily dependent on robust crude exports
russia has initially let the saudis shoulder the bulk of output cuts
the top opec ally which in late began a cooperation agreement with riyadh to stabilize oil prices has often said that per barrel is enough to meet its economic needs
moscow in december said it would cut production by to barrels a day in january while saudi pledged a cut of barrels
