opec is cutting more oil from the market than planned, says former saudi aramco executive
the oil market should prepare for a bullish surprise from opec in january according to a former saudi aramco executive the oil producer group will likely deliver a deeper output cut in january than it promised last month said sadad founder of husseini energy
market analysts could see opec production fall by about million barrels per day from october levels this month husseini said
last month opec agreed to take bpd off the market
pledges from other producers aligned with opec including russia brought total output cuts to million bpd
it working very well husseini told cnbc squawk on the street on thursday
there already been a significant drop in opec production and it continuing on target to come down to about million and barrels in january
opec pumped just under million bpd in october the month that serves as the benchmark for production cuts
if husseini forecast is correct and opec pumps roughly million bpd in january it would equal a reduction of bpd
but husseini said it possible that opec cuts more than million bpd by the end of january and the group could potentially throttle back output by nearly million bpd essentially doing the work of its allies for them
husseini is former executive vice president of exploration and production operations at saudi arabia oil company aramco
saudi arabia is opec top oil producer and the world biggest crude exporter
there are already signs that opec will over deliver in january the month its production deal begins
saudi oil minister khalid said last month that saudi arabia will pump about million bpd in january down from nearly million bpd in november according to the kingdom figures
