legendary trader andy hall bets oil prices are going to rebound
legendary oil trader andy hall says crude prices have likely hit a bottom after plunging more than percent over the last two months
i think with prices hovering around or a little over a barrel i think you would have to have a pretty negative outlook on the global economy to believe that prices will continue their downward trajectory he said in an interview thursday on bloomberg tv
so i think on balance if you want to place a bet on oil right now you probably better off betting on it going up than going down
the former oil trader for citi is famed for predicting a bull market for crude a feat that earned him a million payout at the investment bank
some of the shine has come off hall reputation since the man once deemed an oil god closed his hedge fund astenbeck capital management following hefty losses on crude bets last year
today hall still trades oil with his own money and serves as an advisory board member to orbital insight a company that uses satellite information to provide data on crude and fuel stockpiles
hall says he not expecting a global recession
in the absence of a worldwide slowdown a correction like the one gripping the oil market today tends to temper supply growth and stimulate demand for fuel
for hall the impact of opec recently announced production cuts is the question but it only one piece of the puzzle
the oil market is also grappling with headwinds for fuel demand concerns about a looming trade war and dollar strength that tends to weigh on crude prices according to hall
on the other hand not only have you had opec cut production there no question that lower prices will have an impact on production growth here in the hall said
that said hall believes the growth in shale oil output has been the biggest surprise this year
right now growth in crude production here in the is about million barrels a day
back in january the government eia was forecasting growth of half a million barrels a day so that a staggering difference he said
watch here what drives the price of oil
