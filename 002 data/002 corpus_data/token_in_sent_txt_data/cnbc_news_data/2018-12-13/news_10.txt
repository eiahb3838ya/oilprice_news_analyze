us dominance in oil markets is only going to get bigger, the iea says
the might have been left out from the big summit between opec and producers in vienna last week but the country influence over global oil markets is only going to get stronger the international energy agency iea stated in its latest report
while the was not present in vienna nobody could ignore its growing influence the iea said in its december report published thursday
last week meeting reminded us that the big three of oil russia saudi arabia and the united states whose total liquids production now comprises about percent of the global total are the dominant players the iea said
when opec and producers met last week in vienna to hammer out a deal to cut their oil production there was an uninvited but unavoidable presence at the summit the president trump has repeatedly criticized opec for its dominance over oil prices at times asking usually via twitter it to produce more oil and then telling the cartel to leave its production well alone
iran joked last week that the wanted to join opec as it appeared keen to influence the meeting outcome
the has become a dominant competitor in oil markets in its own right however and has taken a place among the world largest oil producers thanks to its shale oil revolution
