citi forecasts oil goes nowhere in 2019 as opec cuts and us pumps more
citi believes international oil prices will average a barrel in remaining near current levels as production cuts encourage drillers to put more crude on the market
opec russia and other producers agreed on friday to remove million barrels per day from the market beginning in january
the move follows a more than percent collapse in oil prices that saw international benchmark brent crude fall from more than a barrel to a low of last month
some analysts forecast the production cuts will cause brent to rebound back toward or a barrel
however citi says an earlier round of production cuts from the alliance has only delayed the inevitable
rather than putting oil on a steady upward trajectory the new supply cuts almost certainly set up another
