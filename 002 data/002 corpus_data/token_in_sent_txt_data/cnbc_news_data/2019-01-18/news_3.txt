the level of crude output from the will once again be a major factor this year the international energy agency iea said its report on friday with the energy giant on track to reaffirm its position as the world leading crude producer
the iea report comes shortly after opec and producers officially implemented a fresh round of supply cuts
alongside russia and nine other nations top oil exporter saudi arabia struck a deal with the rest of opec in december to keep million barrels per day off the market from the start of january
while the other two giants voluntarily cut output the already the biggest liquids supplier will reinforce its leadership as the world number one crude producer the iea said friday
by the middle of the year crude output will probably be more than the capacity of either saudi arabia or russia
international benchmark brent crude traded at around friday morning up percent while west texas intermediate wti stood at almost percent higher
brent crude has fallen almost percent since climbing to a peak of in early october last year while wti is down more than percent over the same period
the collapse in oil prices was exacerbated by concerns about oversupply as well as a stock market slump amid worries over rising interest rates
