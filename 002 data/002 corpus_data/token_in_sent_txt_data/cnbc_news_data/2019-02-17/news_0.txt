this continued the trend in which china recorded the first annual drop in vehicle sales on record
new energy vehicle sales in january which include electric vehicles registered a percent increase underscoring expectations that oil demand from cars may peak in china in the coming years
despite this data global oil markets remain relatively tight because of supply cuts organized by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and some producers like russia
the group of producer countries agreed late last year to cut output by million barrels per day bpd to prevent a large supply overhang from swelling
further supporting crude prices have been sanctions against oil exporters and iran and venezuela
traders said financial markets including crude futures were also generally supported by hopes that the united states and china would soon resolve their trade disputes which have dragged on global economic growth
positive signs in the trade talks helped boost sentiment across markets anz bank said on monday
at least partly offsetting the supply cuts has been a surge in crude oil production by more than million bpd in to a record million bpd
and there are signs that output will rise further
energy firms last week increased the number of oil rigs looking for new supply by three to a total of energy services firm baker hughes said in a weekly report last friday
that means the rig count is higher than a year ago when fewer than rigs were active
