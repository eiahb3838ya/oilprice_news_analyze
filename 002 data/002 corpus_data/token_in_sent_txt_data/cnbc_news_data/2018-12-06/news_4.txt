update 5-opec agrees tentative oil cut, waits for russia to commit
vienna dec reuters opec tentatively agreed an cut on thursday but was waiting to hear from heavyweight russia before deciding the exact volumes for a production reduction aimed at propping up crude prices two sources from the group said
russian energy minister alexander novak flew home from vienna earlier for talks with president vladimir putin in st petersburg
novak returns to the austrian capital on friday for discussions among opec and the group allies
the price of crude has fallen almost a third since october but president donald trump has demanded the organization of the petroleum exporting countries make oil even cheaper by refraining from output cuts
we hope to conclude something by the end of the day tomorrow we have to get the countries on board saudi energy minister khalid told reporters before the opec meeting started
if everybody is not willing to join and contribute equally we will wait until they are
asked whether opec could fail to reach a deal falih said all options were on the table
possible output cuts by opec and its allies ranged from million bpd and million bpd was acceptable he said
opec meeting began around gmt and was still ongoing after hours
brent oil futures fell as much as percent to below per barrel on fears that there could be no deal but later recovered somewhat trading down percent by gmt
one million bpd may disappoint many
but should the cut be from a september or october baseline rather than november the net impact would be sufficient to limit storage builds greg sharenow executive for pimco said on the sidelines of the opec meeting
it is unlikely to spark a meaningful price rally but also will not be so dire either
in many respects it is the middle road which may be the optimal solution said sharenow who helps manage a billion commodities fund at the trillion investment management firm
opec delegates have said the group and its allies could cut by million bpd if russia contributed bpd of that reduction
if russia contributed around bpd the overall cut could exceed million bpd
novak said on thursday that russia would find it harder to cut oil output in winter than other producers because of the cold weather
oil prices have crashed as saudi arabia russia and the united arab emirates raised output since june after trump called for higher production to offset lower exports from iran opec producer
russia saudi arabia and the united states have been vying for the position of top crude producer in recent years
the united states is not part of any initiative due to its legislation and fragmented oil industry
trump raises pressure iranian exports have plummeted after the united states imposed fresh sanctions on tehran in november
but washington gave sanctions waivers to some buyers of iranian crude further raising fears of an oil glut next year
hopefully opec will be keeping oil flows as is not restricted
the world does not want to see or need higher oil prices
trump wrote in a tweet on wednesday
iranian oil minister bijan zanganeh said on thursday he would support a cut as long as iran did not need to reduce its own output
iraqi oil minister thamer ghadhban said iraq as opec producer would support and join a cut
possibly complicating any opec decision is the crisis around the killing of journalist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul in october
trump has backed saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman despite calls from many politicians to impose stiff sanctions on riyadh
