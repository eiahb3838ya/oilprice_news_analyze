europe is fast-becoming a natural gas battleground for russia and the us
with countries and a combined population of around million people the european union is something of a prized market and political battleground for the world largest energy exporters particularly when it comes to natural gas
russia has long been the dominant source and supplier of natural gas to europe mass market but the is looking to challenge russia by stepping up its imports of liquefied natural gas lng gas which is to liquid form making it easier and safer to store and transport
europe certainly appears keen to wean itself off russian gas and all the geopolitical implications that reliance entails while making overtures to the last july european commission president juncker and president donald trump agreed to strengthen strategic cooperation with respect to energy and the eu said it would import more lng from the to diversify and render its energy supply more secure
percent of lng went to the eu in october a month which saw the largest volume ever of trade in lng of almost billion cubic meters
in the whole of only percent of lng exports went to the eu
the commission the eu executive arm expects gas exports to the region could double by and has vaunted the construction of lng terminals across europe
the fact is that lng if priced competitively can play and increasing role in eu gas supply enhancing diversification and eu energy security the eu said in a document detailing the state of lng trade in late november
