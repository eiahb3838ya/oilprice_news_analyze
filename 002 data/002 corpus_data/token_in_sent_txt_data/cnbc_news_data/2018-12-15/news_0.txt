kuwait however did not take part in the blockade
its government maintains smooth relations with doha and has made several attempts to mediate between qatar and its gulf neighbors to help quell the conflict thus far to no avail
kuwait has shown willingness to play a diplomatic role in some of the most complex contexts in the region including qatar and yemen cinzia bianco gcc analyst at gulf state analytics told cnbc earlier this month
