canada's oil cuts offer lifeline to producers but create new problems
winnipeg manitoba jan reuters the canadian province of alberta decision to force production cuts is benefiting oil companies with higher prices but it is also pushing capital elsewhere and threatens to undermine booming shipments
after alberta cut barrels per day bpd starting this month the discount on canadian heavy oil compared to benchmark crude oil shrank to less than per barrel from more than in october providing relief for producers
but drilling activity has dropped sharply in the last year hurting service providers and the shrinking discount reduces incentive for shippers to move crude by rail which is costlier than pipelines
some producers have already decided to spend more in other provinces
as soon as we heard this curtailment was taking place we shifted our capital to saskatchewan from alberta said grant fagerheim chief executive of producer whitecap resources whitecap intends to spend about percent of its c million million capex in saskatchewan up from its usual spending there of around percent fagerheim said
canada is the world crude producer but larger producers like the united states saudi arabia and russia do not face canada obstacles in getting oil to market
full pipelines and aggressive opposition to expanding the industry meant that even as canada production hit record levels last year benefits of that boom were elusive
alberta which produces most of canada oil last month ordered curtailments to drain bloated storage tanks and boost prices
government intervention has provided a lifeline to producers that were selling barrels at a loss late last year and avoided an economic catastrophe for canada
bonterra energy corp produces less than bpd making it exempt from requirements to curb output but it still benefits from higher prices chief executive george fink said
drillers hit cenovus energy inc which announced plans last year to increase shipments by rail is seeing a very positive impact on cash flow due to small price discounts senior vice president of downstream keith chiasson told reuters
but with growth capital leaving alberta and transportation problems unresolved producers are feeling their way along in the early days of reckoning with almost unprecedented challenges
across canada rigs were working as of down rigs from a year earlier according to baker hughes data
companies that provide contract services for producers such as drilling are looking to the united states and mexico said gary mar chief executive of the petroleum services association of canada
production cuts worsened an already grim situation for service companies mar said
asked about the curtailment program unintended consequences an alberta government spokesman noted that its strategy was focused on getting top dollar for its oil
there too much at stake and we should be selling our products on the cheap said mike mckinnon spokesman for alberta energy minister
but prices have improved so dramatically that shipping by rail the backup plan for moving crude until new pipelines are built makes less economic sense
the cost of shipping crude by rail to buyers is estimated around to per barrel well above the current differential
cenovus would not comment on whether the company is losing money on rail shipments but said they are scheduled to ramp up in the second quarter once new cars arrive
devon energy corp was planning to move percent of its canadian heavy oil this year by rail but the narrow differentials now make that an unlikely target said rob dutton devon senior vice president of canadian operations
devon currently moves less than percent by train
it more difficult now to reach that level dutton said in an interview
days ago i would have said for sure
