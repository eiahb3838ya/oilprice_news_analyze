poland's goal of ditching russian natural gas bolsters american lng and trump's energy agenda
poland took another step towards weening itself off russian energy supplies on wednesday by signing a agreement with san sempra energy to import liquefied natural gas
the signing marks the third contract the polish oil and gas company or pgnig has inked with an american lng company this year
in the coming years warsaw plans to replace russian gas with pipeline supplies from norway and shipments of lng or gas to liquid from for transport by sea
that is opening an opportunity for the energy industry which is on the cusp of a opening a second wave of lng export terminals
the trump administration eager to dominate the global energy market has been pitching the supplies in trade talks from beijing to warsaw
eastern and central european nations which have a complicated and frequently antagonistic relationship with moscow have been a receptive audience
this is a big deal said assistant secretary francis fannon who heads the state department bureau of energy resources
fannon told cnbc power lunch that poland is stepping up and answering the call on energy security for europe
