if tuesday collapse in crude prices below a barrel looked ugly try being a driller in the permian basin the epicenter of the shale oil boom
crude is trading at about a barrel in the western texas region that sits atop most of the permian basin
at that price oil is selling for less than the cost of developing new wells raising concerns for a region that emerged from a bruising downturn just two years ago
when you get down below a barrel in the permian you are talking about a potential recession in a sector that you probably never ever thought might be prone to a recession in said tom kloza global head of energy analysis at fuel price service opis
