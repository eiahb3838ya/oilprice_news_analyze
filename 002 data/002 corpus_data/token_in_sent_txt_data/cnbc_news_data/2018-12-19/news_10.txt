however despite a protracted in crude futures the meteoric rise of shale should continue undeterred over the coming months analysts told cnbc
in short as much as the recent price slump has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty it is unlikely to derail the shale engine stephen brennock oil analyst at pvm oil associates said in a research note published wednesday
the fact is that tight oil supply is expected to expand by at least million bpd in
in doing so it will go a long way to cementing america newfound position as the world biggest oil producer
for now when it comes to the shale patch the glory days are far from over brennock said
since climbing to highs in early october crude futures have tumbled by more than a third
the latest wave of heavy selling comes at a time when the energy market as well as the global economy is gripped by a flurry of bearish factors
heightened concerns of oversupply reports of swelling inventories forecasts of record and russian output and intensifying concerns about a slowing global economy have all placed downward pressure on the value of a barrel of oil
international benchmark brent crude traded at around on wednesday up around percent while west texas intermediate wti stood at around more than percent higher
