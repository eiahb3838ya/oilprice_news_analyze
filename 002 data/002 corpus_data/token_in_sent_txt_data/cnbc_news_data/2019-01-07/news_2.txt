secretary of state mike pompeo says oil prices don't influence us response to saudi arabia over khashoggi killing, contrary to trump's stance
secretary of state mike pompeo on monday said oil prices did not and will not influence the trump administration response to the killing of saudi dissident jamal khashoggi
pompeo remarks made in an interview with cnbc wilfred frost come three months after saudi agents killed the washington post columnist in the kingdom consulate in istanbul turkey
in november president donald trump declared the united states stands with saudi arabia even though the cia has reportedly concluded that saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman played a role in the slaying
at the time trump linked his stance to saudi arabia help taming oil prices as well as its role countering iran in the middle east and its pledge to buy more weapons
saudi arabia if we broke with them i think your oil prices would go through the roof
i kept them down
they helped me keep them down trump told reporters after issuing a statement spelling out his support for the saudi government
one day later trump thanked saudi arabia for taking steps to lower oil prices and implored the kingdom to push them even lower
realdonaldtrump oil prices getting lower
great
like a big tax cut for america and the world
enjoy
was just
thank you to saudi arabia but let go lower
asked whether low oil prices influenced the administration response and whether trump might take a tougher stance if the saudis let oil prices rise pompeo said they disconnected
we taken a very clear message to the world with respect to the murder of jamal khashoggi pompeo told cnbc
this was a heinous act
it unacceptable
it inconsistent with the way nations ought to behave around the world
concerned about rising gasoline costs trump called on saudi arabia and opec to pump more oil throughout
between june and november saudi arabia sharply hiked oil production helping to knock the cost of crude from a high
in october oil prices plunged with crude falling from nearly to about a barrel when trump issued the statement
two weeks after trump issued the statement the saudis reached a deal to launch production cuts with fellow opec members and allied oil producers including russia
the administration response to khashoggi killing has drawn fire from both democrats and republicans on capitol hill
last month the senate voted to halt military assistance to saudi arabia for the war in yemen
senators also voted unanimously to hold crown prince mohammed responsible for khashoggi death
pompeo on monday defended the administration stance referring to its move to sanction people linked to khashoggi death
we told the saudis that we held saudi citizens accountable for the murder of jamal khashoggi
we will continue to do so as new facts arise pompeo said
at the same time we going to continue to do the things that protect the american people and that includes a deep and lasting relationship with the kingdom of saudi arabia
