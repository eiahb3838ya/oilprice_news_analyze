beyond politics oil markets are being supported by supply cuts started late last year by a group of producers around the middle organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec as well as member russia
crude oil prices have benefited from opec production cuts and steadying equities markets said mithun fernando investment analyst at australia rivkin securities
looming over the cuts however is a surge in oil supply driven by a steep rise in onshore shale oil drilling and production
