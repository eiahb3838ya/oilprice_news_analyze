trump administration still might let iran export oil, and that could lower prices
the trump administration is leaving itself wiggle room to continue allowing iran to export oil potentially setting up another catalyst for lower crude prices later this year
the administration special representative for iran brian hook last weekend refused to say with certainty whether the white house will enforce sanctions more strictly on the islamic republic oil exports
instead he left the door open to extending exemptions that have allowed some of iran biggest customers to continue importing its crude
the administration decision in november to grant sanctions waivers to eight countries including china and india surprised the market and contributed to a collapse in crude oil prices
