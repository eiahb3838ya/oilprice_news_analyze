us oil heads to china, but it's too early to declare victory in the trade war
the first oil shipments to china in months will reach their destinations just days from now punctuating a pledge by president donald trump in december that china would begin buying more american products despite an ongoing trade battle
the shipments which left ports in texas in late december are not a clear sign of victory however
they are among a handful bound for china or points near it currently as a march negotiating deadline on a new trade deal draws near
and the amount of oil being shipped to china is well below what it was a year ago when the trade war erupted
