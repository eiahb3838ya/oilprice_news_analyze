russia dashes plans to make its oil market alliance with opec permanent
the marriage between russia and opec is off
russian energy minister alexander novak on friday poured cold water on plans to make moscow alliance with opec and other oil producers permanent
the group of roughly two dozen producers has been managing global petroleum supply for the last two years in order to rebalance the market after a prolonged and punishing oil price downturn
the effort succeeded in shrinking global crude stockpiles and boosting prices to highs until the market suddenly crashed again in early october
the group has agreed to a fresh round of output cuts that begin
for at least a year opec secretary general mohammed barkindo has discussed institutionalizing the arrangement
that would essentially form a supergroup of oil producers comprised of the opec russia and nine other nations which would be able to more quickly respond to problems in the market
