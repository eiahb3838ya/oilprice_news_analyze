china's iran oil imports to rebound in dec as buyers use u.s. waivers
dec reuters china iranian oil imports are set to rebound in december after two refiners in the world largest oil importer began using the nation waiver from sanctions on iran according to industry sources and data on refinitiv eikon
sinopec resumed iran oil imports shortly after tehran biggest crude buyer received its waiver in november while china national petroleum corp cnpc will restart lifting from its own iranian production in december three sources with knowledge of the matter told reuters
reuters reported in november that china waiver on sanctions allows it to buy barrels per day bpd of oil for days
top chinese energy group cnpc which has invested billions of dollars in iranian oilfields is ready to load its full share of production from december said an oil executive with direct knowledge of cnpc iran activities
the executive who asked not to be named estimated cnpc will load at least two million barrels a month from december doubling previous levels to help compensate for cuts made before sanctions on iran oil exports went into effect on nov
before the waivers had been announced sinopec asia largest oil refiner had planned to stop loading iran oil in november but resumed imports within days of getting the exemption a second source said also asking to remain unnamed
we continued lifting iranian oil in november because we received the waiver the second source said
sinopec and cnpc will likely use up the bpd of iranian oil imports allowed to china under the waiver
another source said iranian oil is attractively priced versus rival supplies from the middle east
for november and december iranian heavy crude sold to asia has been priced at a barrel below saudi arab medium a discount not seen since
the source also said many chinese refiners were geared towards processing iranian crude grades
at bpd china purchases would still be percent less than the average bpd imported during the period
the rise in iranian oil supply and surging production from the united states russia and opec countries has pulled down crude oil prices by almost a third since october
ahead of the sanctions being implemented in early november china crude oil imports from iran fell to million tonnes bpd in october the lowest since may chinese customs data shows
data from refinitiv eikon however shows that million tonnes of iranian crude were discharged into chinese ports in october including into bonded storage tanks in dalian
million tonnes the eikon data showed
a total million tonnes of iranian crude were discharged into dalian in october and november according to the data
other major iranian oil buyers including india south korea and japan are also increasing or resuming orders
it is still not clear whether iran will be able to export much oil after the sanctions waivers expire around the start of may
