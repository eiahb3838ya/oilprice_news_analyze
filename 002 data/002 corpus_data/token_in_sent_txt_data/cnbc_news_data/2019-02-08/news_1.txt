a bill to hobble opec is advancing in congress. trump's support is the question
democrats and republicans do agree on much these days but a bipartisan group of lawmakers is finding common cause in legislation that would make life very difficult for the oil producer group opec
legislation that aims to prevent the opec from coordinating production and influencing oil prices is once again advancing on capitol hill
on friday at least one senior trump administration official expressed support for the legislation signaling a potential chip in white house opposition to the measure which has held firm for the last two decades
on thursday the house judiciary committee passed the no oil producing and exporting cartels act commonly known as nopec clearing the bill for a vote before the full house of representatives
the same day democrats patrick leahy and amy klobuchar and republicans chuck grassley and mike lee introduced nopec legislation in the senate
the bills would essentially make it illegal for foreign nations to work together to limit fossil fuel supplies and set prices
they would authorize the justice department to sue oil producers for antitrust violations by stripping foreign actors of sovereign immunity protections
