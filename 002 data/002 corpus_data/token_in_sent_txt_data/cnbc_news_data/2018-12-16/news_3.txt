qatari foreign minister criticizes iran sanctions, uae foreign policy as 'destabilizing'
qatar foreign minister expressed a host of grievances over his gulf counterparts regional activities on sunday calling out saudi arabia and the united arab emirates uae in particular and not just for their blockade of his country
we can not blame one country on the destabilization of the region right now because the situation which we are suffering from is the result of a series of policies of different countries sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al thani told cnbc hadley gamble in doha when asked if riyadh were to blame for increased turbulence in the middle east
we are disagreeing with saudi arabia currently when they are blockading qatar when they continue the war on yemen without reason the way they kidnapped the lebanese prime minister the foreign minister said
but he did not limit his criticism to saudi arabia which in spearheaded an economic and diplomatic blockade against qatar over accusations doha supports terrorism something the qataris deny
we disagree also with the emiratis policy when they go and supported brutal regimes supported military coup in libya supported a destabilization in somalia supported the separation and division of yemen
and it just these policies which are destabilization
