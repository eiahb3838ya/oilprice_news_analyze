trump's war on energy and environmental regulation is about to face the 'spanish inquisition'
president donald trump set in motion a vast rollback of energy climate and environmental regulations during his first two years in office
over the next two years those actions will face intense scrutiny on capitol hill
on thursday democrats will take control of the house of representatives and the committees that conduct government oversight
within the first few months of the year incoming committee chairs intend to hold a series of hearings to pick apart trump energy and environmental policies and what role industry insiders played in crafting them
the trump administration has targeted dozens of rules
some of the biggest items on its agenda include withdrawing the united states from the paris climate agreement expanding drilling on federal lands and watering down rules ranging from limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to fuel efficiency in cars and trucks
raul grijalva the arizona democrat tipped to chair the house natural resources committee says americans can expect the committee to probe the financial costs and public health risks associated with interior department policies under trump
those include rolling back methane emissions rules from oil and gas operations and making virtually all federally administered offshore waters available to drillers
the trump administration has spent two years giving away the store to fossil fuel companies and republicans in congress cheered every step of the way says grijalva
we need to know what kind of impact this corporate favoritism is having on average americans health and quality of life
