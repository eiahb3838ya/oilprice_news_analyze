here's why gas prices are falling, and why drivers shouldn't get too used to them
crude oil sharp fall in has helped put some extra money in consumers pockets in the form of falling gas prices
according to aaa nine states saw prices at the pump drop below a gallon late this week a gift for drivers this holiday season
over the last days retail averages have dropped of the past days with the downward trend expected to continue into early next year the organization said
over the last two years russia and the cartel of the world largest oil producers known as opec have been managing the global petroleum supply in order to rebalance the market after a prolonged and punishing oil price downturn
while there are many factors driving down energy prices it raises the question of whether the drop is linked to supply and demand
according to one veteran oil market watcher a more technical factor could be behind the move
i think it mostly supply and it something that tends to happen between october and april when gasoline becomes the unwanted hydrocarbon said tom kloza global head of energy analysis at fuel price service opis
kloza explained that during this period refiners are moving to more profitable diesel heating oil and jet fuel production and away from gasoline
we just manufacture too much of it kloza told cnbc on the money in a recent interview and we just came out of a couple months where opec producers were producing more crude than what they pledged to in january
however kloza predicted the low prices at the pump will head back up in the springtime
i think the bottom line is and the end of will be bookended with cheap prices but in the middle we going to go considerably higher than that and you got to be aware of that kloza told cnbc
when the baseball season on you going to see higher prices he added
nevertheless kloza predicted that demand for gasoline is probably going to be flat actually for the next few years
the thing that keeps refiners going is export demand
with travelers still hitting the friendly skies and airlines also deriving a benefit from cheaper fuel prices kloza said
yet flyers should get their hopes up for cheaper travel costs
lower jet fuel prices do mean lower airfares we learned that in the last ten years kloza added
