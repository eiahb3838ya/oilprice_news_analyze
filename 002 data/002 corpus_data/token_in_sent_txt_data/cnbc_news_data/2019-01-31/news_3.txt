crude oil prices were stronger after signs emerged that opec cuts are impacting trade
eia weekly report showed that imports from saudi arabia fell by more than half from the previous week to barrels per day bpd
this is the second lowest level in weekly data going back to anz bank said
saudi arabia is the leader of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec which together with some producers including russia announced supply cuts late last year aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices
sanctions imposed on firm petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa this week are also causing some supply disruptions
venezuela oil inventories have started to build up at the country ports and terminals as pdvsa is finding it can not export crude at its usual rate due to sanctions imposed earlier this week
as of wednesday venezuela had tankers with nearly million barrels of crude representing about two weeks of the country production either waiting to load or expecting authorisation to set sail shipping data showed
matt stanley a broker with starfuels in dubai said the combination of sanctions against oil producers venezuela and iran the supply cuts as well as hopes that the trade dispute between the united states and china could soon be resolved meant oil prices would likely rise further
there are just too many factors that can only cause the price to go one way and that is up stanley said
despite this oil remains in ample supply not least because of soaring crude oil production which jumped by more than million bpd last year to a record million bpd
this shows in high commercial crude oil stockpiles which rose by barrels in the week to to million barrels eia data showed
stockpiles are percent higher than a year ago
