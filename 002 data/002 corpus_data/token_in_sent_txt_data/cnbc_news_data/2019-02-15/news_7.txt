update 7-brent oil hits $65 as production cuts fuel 2019 high
london feb reuters brent crude oil briefly reached highs above a barrel on friday as supply cuts and this week announcement of a higher than expected cut by saudi arabia encouraged investors
the international oil benchmark rose as high as pushing past for the first time this year
it slipped back to by gmt up cents
that equated to a percent gain keeping brent near highs and set for a more than percent gain on the week
west texas intermediate crude futures were at a barrel up cents from their last settlement
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and allies led by russia started voluntary production cuts last month aiming to tighten the market
top exporter and de facto opec leader saudi arabia said on tuesday it would cut more than half a million barrels per day bpd more in march than the deal called for sending prices surging
prices were also buoyed by the partial closure of saudi arabia safaniya its largest offshore oilfield with production capacity of more than million bpd
the shutdown occurred about two weeks ago a source said and it was not immediately clear when the field would return to full capacity
brent should average per barrel in helped by voluntary saudi kuwait uae and involuntary venezuela iran declines in opec supply bank of america merrill lynch said in a note
the bank said it expects a drop of million bpd in opec supply in the fourth quarter of from a year earlier
however the global supply picture remains uncertain
oil production is on the rise while the seizure of libya main oilfield by eastern armed forces this week could lead to its reopening
but sanctions on venezuela and iran have have helped to tighten global supply and security threats could threaten nigerian production after general elections this weekend
looking ahead the prognosis for venezuela and iran remains skewed to the downside
as such they should continue to act as important pillars of price support
the same however cant be said for libya said stephen brennock of oil broker pvm
this risks throwing a spanner in the works for opec rebalancing ambitions and therefore the price recovery
faltering global economic growth is also a concern with signs of a slowdown now abundant in europe asia and the united states which could lead to slowing growth in fuel demand
