update 9-brent crude hits 2019 high above $65, buoyed by output cuts
london feb reuters brent crude oil climbed above a barrel to its highest this year as supply cuts and this week announcement of a higher than expected cut by saudi arabia encouraged investors
the international oil benchmark reached by gmt on friday the cent gain equating to a rise of about percent
brent approached near highs and was set for a gain of nearly percent on the week
west texas intermediate crude futures were up about percent rising cents to
the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec and allies led by russia started voluntary production cuts last month aiming to tighten the market
top exporter and de facto opec leader saudi arabia said on tuesday that in march it would cut more than half a million barrels per day bpd more than the deal called for sending prices surging
the cuts come alongside involuntary production curbs as a result of sanctions on venezuelan and iranian crude along with curtailed libyan output because of civil unrest
prices were also buoyed by the partial closure of saudi arabia safaniya its largest offshore oilfield with production capacity of more than million bpd
the shutdown occurred about two weeks ago a source said and it was not immediately clear when the field would return to full capacity
the market may be reconnecting with its fundamentals specifically the several major supply chokeholds that have stacked up in recent months over and above the voluntary opec output restraints said analyst vandana hari of vanda insights
bank of american merrill lynch said in a note that it expects a drop of million bpd in opec supply in the fourth quarter of from a year earlier
however the global supply picture remains uncertain
oil production is on the rise while the seizure of libya main oilfield by eastern armed forces this week could soon lead to its reopening
but reduced exports from venezuela and iran have helped to tighten global supply and security threats could threaten nigerian production after general elections this weekend
looking ahead the prognosis for venezuela and iran remains skewed to the downside
as such they should continue to act as important pillars of price support
the same however cant be said for libya said stephen brennock of oil broker pvm
this risks throwing a spanner in the works for opec rebalancing ambitions and therefore the price recovery
faltering global economic growth is also a concern with signs of a slowdown now abundant in europe asia and the united states which could lead to slowing growth in fuel demand
