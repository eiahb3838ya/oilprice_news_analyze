plunging oil prices show the market is worried about a recession in 2019, says analyst
the continuing collapse in oil prices signals that investors are worried about a recession according to helima croft global head of commodity strategy at rbc capital markets
oil prices have now plunged by about percent from their highs at the start of october
last week alone west texas intermediate crude tumbled percent posting its worst weekly performance in nearly three years
on monday wti fell below a barrel for the first time since july
i think what we seeing in oil is a big big concern for about a recession
i think that is really weighing heavily on this market croft told cnbc closing bell on friday
croft commentary reflects an emerging view on wall street that slowing economic growth and demand are pushing the oil market deeper into bear market territory
the rout has continued despite a pledge earlier this month by opec russia and several other oil producers to remove million barrels per day from the market beginning in january
surging oil production from the united states saudi arabia and russia is one factor behind the selling
but croft says the depth of the pullback indicates that expectations for slower economic growth and darkening demand forecasts are what truly driving the rout
i think it a fear about where is demand going to be for oil next year concerns about chinese demand in particular croft said
to be sure croft is not necessarily forecasting a recession and there are few clear signs that a period of economic contraction is on the horizon
still surveys indicate that executives are growing more worried about the prospect
nearly half of chief financial officers see a chance that a recession will hit by the end of according to a cnbc survey
meanwhile trade tensions are causing finance executives to lose faith in china economic growth a deloitte survey shows
croft is not the only analyst now focusing on the demand side of the oil market ledger
