trump 'hasn't been fair' to opec: oman oil minister
oman oil minister thinks president donald trump has given opec some undue flak
but echoing other gulf ministers mohammed bin hamad stressed his desire to steer clear of political animosity with the american leader appearing keen to give him the benefit of the doubt
sometimes he has been fair told cnbc hadley gamble while at the atlantic council global energy forum in abu dhabi
i sure he has good intention too he thinks he is representing the people of the and he thinks this is the way to do it
nobody wants volatility i am sure trump does want volatility because volatility is difficult to manage he said
trump has spent months vocally criticizing the cartel for its management of oil output urging the group to keep the taps open and oil prices low
opec is ripping us off trump said in a tweet last october
in december opec members along with russia reached an agreement to cut their crude production by million barrels of oil per day from the market in order to stem the fall in prices something that further drew trump ire
unfortunately there are politics but sometimes the politics forces people to go to the social media or to cnbc to present their case
and that is the reality of today the minister said
