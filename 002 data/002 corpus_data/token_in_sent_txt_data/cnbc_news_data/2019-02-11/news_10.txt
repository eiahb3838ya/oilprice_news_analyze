$60 to $70 is a fair price for a barrel of oil, egypt's petroleum minister says
there is a fair price for a barrel of oil and opec and its partners are close to achieving it through their deal to cut production according to egypt petroleum minister tarek
it is in the range between and a barrel somewhere in this bracket of price el molla told cnbc on sunday when asked if oil prices were at an acceptable level to keep producers and consumers happy
if prices of crude increase significantly we would start to see inflation and an exaggeration in the slowdown in consumption from the other side
if we see prices go down below a certain price then we will see a slowdown in investments he said
so actually the fair equation is to have a balanced price between the producers and the consumers whereby each party is happy and to continue the growth of the global economy
egypt is a significant oil and natural gas producer in the middle east although it not a member of opec and its output is dwarfed by members of the oil producing group and other producers like russia
egypt is aiming to boost production modestly in to barrels a day although its output still trails that of others in the region
the latest figures from opec monthly report in january showed that egypt oil producing neighbors to the west libya and algeria produced barrels a day and a million barrels a day respectively in december
opec lynchpin saudi arabia produced million barrels a day
