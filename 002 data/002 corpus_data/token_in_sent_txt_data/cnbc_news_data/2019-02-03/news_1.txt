us infrastructure is crumbling, and it needs lots of money to fix it: civil engineer group
elon musk has tunnel vision and its giving several cities similar ideas
the tesla ceo and entrepreneur sees commuters using a system of tunnels below ground in los angeles and other cities to beat the traffic
in a recent interview with cnbc the head of the american society of civil engineers agreed that the ambitious idea is no pipe dream
it absolutely viable
it the infrastructure of the future asce executive director tom smith said about the boring company proposed underground transportation network
there a lot of innovation that sustainable that we can use hyperloop and tunneling is one example smith told cnbc on the money in a recent interview
but while he saw the opportunity for successful future projects the asce gave the united states a current overall grade of in its most recent infrastructure report card in
smith acknowledged that a is a very lousy score
the poor grade reflects unfortunately a failure to invest in our infrastructure in the united states
we been relying on the work that was done by former generations he said
and there an investment that we need to make to make sure we protecting future generations going forward
smith explained the asce has a panel of civil engineers who analyze federal government data in categories releasing the report card every four years
we looking at aviation bridges roads transit dams levees schools parks solid waste drinking water waste water he told cnbc
unfortunately out of categories are in the d range which is poor or which is really reflecting a lot of our infrastructure being at the end of its useful life
smith said the asce calculated a trillion dollar infrastructure funding gap between and
he added that about half of that is for surface transportation which includes transit roads bridges and rail
in the asce report card transit scored a d the nation roads rated a d and bridges got a but the organization did reveal some positive news
the highest grade right now is in the rail category
and i think that reflects freight rail with a lot of private investment smith stated
but on the passenger side i think that really bringing that score down
we need a lot of investment there
