why the stock market is obsessed with oil prices
stocks are taking a cue from volatile oil prices where traders are looking for signs of a recession and other problems in the market according to analysts
crude futures and stocks have been trading in tandem throughout much of the last few months in part because both markets are concerned about the same macro factors rising interest rates the ongoing trade dispute and signs of slowing global economic growth
crude futures performance however some strategists believe equities are actually following oil prices which serve as a sort of recession barometer since economic growth is closely tied to fuel demand
at the end of last year the collapse in crude futures essentially amplified fears of federal reserve rate hikes trade tensions and the pace of economic growth
stocks were far less of a lead indicator and more of a concurrent indicator than they usually are said julian emanuel head of equities and derivatives strategy at btig
oil really got caught in the same geopolitical uncertainty downdraft
emanuel notes that stocks bottomed on after crude hit a trough on
since their intraday lows benchmark oil prices are up about percent while the s p has bounced back about percent
the price of oil is telling you there is going to be a recession
it firming up
to me that the feed through loop into equities emanuel said
s p performance oil prices are likely to head higher in in part because saudi arabia has backstopped the market on the supply side with significant output cuts said francisco blanch head of global commodities and derivatives research at bank of america merrill lynch
but there is also now support on the demand side following commentary from federal reserve chairman jerome powell that the central bank will be patient with future interest rate increases
with a shift in fed policy direction approaching we see an oil put being triggered within the forecasting horizon blanch said in a research note friday
in other words we think that the global recession fears priced into oil markets during the christmas period were overblown and see the fed acting preemptively to deter a major global economic deceleration
