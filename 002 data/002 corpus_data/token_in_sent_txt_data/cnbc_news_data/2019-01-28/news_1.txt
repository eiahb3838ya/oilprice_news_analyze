cramer remix: if you absolutely have to dabble in chinese stocks, stick with this one
chinese stocks especially ones that are new to markets may seem like appealing investments but to cnbc jim cramer most of them are worth the risk
in chinese companies had initial public offerings on stock exchanges up from the year before
the deals raised about billion in gross proceeds accounting for roughly percent of the ipo market
but aside from a few decent names like tencent music entertainment which cramer tentatively recommended after its ipo in december investors should steer clear of this volatile group the mad money host said
still there are some exceptions he told investors monday
larger companies from china with higher profiles do tend to perform better
if you absolutely have to dabble in chinese ipos please stick with the larger companies that we know more about that even can be household names like alibaba
but even with alibaba he insisted that you should invest only if you want to go there
