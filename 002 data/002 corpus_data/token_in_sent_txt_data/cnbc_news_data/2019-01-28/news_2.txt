here's the most important thing going on in the oil market, according to oil guru who predicted past declines
the most important trend happening in the oil market has to do with china oil guru and rbn energy president and principal energy markets consultant rusty braziel tells cnbc jim cramer
braziel a frequent mad money guest who has correctly predicted several oil price collapses in recent years referenced the commodity price drop in october of last year
after starting the month near highs crude oil prices saw their biggest monthly drop in over two years
since october oil prices have been trading lower a trend some have connected to incipient economic weakness in china
while cramer was convinced by that line of thinking braziel said in a monday interview that it actually had merit
if demand in china is down if the economy in china is down that means the total demand for crude oil is going to be down
if crude oil demand drops then total demand drops then crude oil prices are likely to decline too braziel said
as a matter of fact that really the most important thing that going on right now and it what happened back in
in the fourth quarter of crude oil prices saw a steep decline during a worldwide oil glut in which global production exceeded demand
from their highs in june to their troughs in december they lost over percent in market value
in the economy got weaker and when that happened the market lost confidence in its ability to absorb incremental production of crude oil from the united states braziel explained
that exactly what happened in october
as for where oil going next braziel answer was quite as colorful but it could come as a relief to energy
the market has recognized that it was never going to be he said pointing to the oil futures curve
it was never going to be
it going to be bouncing back and forth between some number around or
