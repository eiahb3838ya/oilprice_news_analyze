late summer temperatures and a surprisingly cold fall increased demand for cooling and heating last year causing natural gas stockpiles to fall to their lowest level in over a decade
stockpile levels have improved after a warm second half of december but a prolonged cold period will put renewed pressure on inventories and bid up gas prices says meisel
it currently unlikely the cold will last long enough or be strong enough to push inventories toward record lows but another move above per mmbtu remains a risk
you would need to really sustain this cold through at least a third or half of february in order to get even though we made great progress in the storage deficit over the last month said meisel
i still would rule out if the cold lasts long enough
