the most likely outcome of the opec meeting
the meeting is set to kickoff with a press conference scheduled for thursday afternoon in vienna
while there seems to be a vague outline of an agreement in hand there is still quite a bit of uncertainty about what might come out of the oil minister khalid injected a bit more uncertainty into the market with his comments in a tuesday interview with bloomberg
he said that russia supports production restraints in principle but that it would be premature to say what specifically they might agree to
he even said that still needs to figure out what needs to be done and by how while there is always a bit of jawboning and word games ahead of any opec meeting the comments suggest that there is still some disagreement over the specifics
we need to get together and listen to our colleagues hear about their views on supply and demand and their projections of their own countries production said
the next road to cross is whether all countries are willing to come on board and contribute to that saudi arabia s inclination is to cut aggressively but it also does not want to anger president donald trump who has bailed the saudis out on the khashoggi affair
was notably more circumspect regarding a production cut on tuesday than he was only a few weeks ago when he announced that saudi arabia would unilaterally lower exports beginning in december
between then and now the senate passed a bill ending american support for the saudi war in yemen significantly upping the pressure on saudi arabia not to cut by too much

even though russian president vladimir putin said that he was on board bloomberg reports that russia only wants to cut output by bpd a rather modest amount which would mean more heavy lifting by saudi arabia to balance the market
russia appears willing to go along with some sort of reduction but it also does not feel the same urgency as the saudis particularly because of the dynamics of how its currency fluctuates with oil prices making lower prices much less painful compared to saudi if saudi arabia and russia are not quite on the same page regarding the size of the cut and how to share the reductions most analysts see some sort of deal emerging from thursday s meeting
in fact even though russia is not a price hawk in the same way that saudi arabia is moscow can gain from the damaged relationship between washington and having stayed largely silent on the khashoggi case moscow has an opportunity to strengthen relations with riyadh further if it accommodates saudi arabia torbjorn soltvedt politics principal analyst for verisk maplecroft wrote in a note to clients
an agreement led by saudi arabia and russia that openly defies the us is unlikely but we believe riyadh has a good chance of securing the participation of moscow in a flexible supply cut related australians create battery from wastesoltvedt said that the consultancy s basecase scenario is a cut with russian participation but a flexible agreement that shies away from specific individual countries may not have specific targets instead a collective target could be the main is important verisk maplecroft argues because the oil market could undergo another dramatic shift in just a few months time
another benefit of this approach is that it reduces the likelihood of another opec if the trump administrations decides to not renew iran waivers expiring in may soltvedt of verisk maplecroft wrote
with around million bpd of iranian oil in the balance a rigid opec agreement in the traditional mold risks quickly being overtaken by events in the trump administration mainly secretary of state mike pompeo and national security advisor john bolton are eager to tighten the screws on iran
in october as the was in the midst of preparing to issue waivers for eight countries importing oil from iran the oil market looked precariously tight
the ensuing price crash no doubt made worse by the waivers themselves has revealed a market much looser than means that by may the trump administration will likely want to let most of those waivers expire
the result could be much more iranian supply knocked offline
saudi arabia and russia need to account for this possibility at thursday s meeting in vienna
that means as verisk maplecroft argues a production cut but one that can be easily rolled back should events require nick cunningham of top reads from
