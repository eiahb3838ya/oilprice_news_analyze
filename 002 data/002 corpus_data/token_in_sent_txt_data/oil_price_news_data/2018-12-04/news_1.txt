iran: oil to fall to $40 if opec fails to reach deal
a fractured opec is meeting later this week to discuss a deal to cut oil rebalance the market and lift oil prices that have recently slipped to below most of the cartel members needs a unanimous vote to pass decisions such as curtailing production
yet of opec s biggest producers but also one of the most sidelined members in recent that the group is unlikely to reach an agreement on a sizeable cut of around million bpd as some are suggesting
such a failure to act decisively would send oil prices plunging to a barrel iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili told bloomberg in an cartel and its allies may not extend their cooperation pact either according to iran s representative at position typically held by the second most powerful oilman in a cartel member after the oil has repeatedly expressed frustration with the increase in oil production since june to offset what was expected to be a steep decline in iranian oil supply with the sanctions on tehran s petroleum and shipping s oil exports indeed dropped by some million bpd but they are likely still holding onto above million bpd while waivers to eight iranian customers allow buyers to continue purchasing oil at reduced volumes until the end of april next prices have plunged by around percent from early october as the market started to fear an oversupply is building up again due to record high production in saudi arabia and russia and an high oil output in the united states coupled with fears of slowing economic and oil demand i doubt with the failure they had in the last three months that the declaration of cooperation gets extended kazempour told bloomberg referring to the alliance
related are oil markets about to turn around why institutionalize a failure
and it needs unanimity to be extended he for one will not take part in any cuts while there are sanctions on its oil kazempour said adding that those who increased production should be the ones to cut that is the saudis and russians and few arab gulf states like the uae and now they are asking others to share in the cut
whoever increased they should cut kazempour told reuters on the pilot and crashed the plane and all passengers are now in critical condition said iran s opec pilot and however agreed this weekend to extend the deal russia s president vladimir putin said although he admitted there isn t an agreement on specific cuts but we together with saudi arabia will do this and whatever final figure we will decide upon we agreed that we will monitor the market situation and promptly respond to it putin the general framework between opec and may be in place saudi arabia will have to appease growing frustration at smaller members within opec and convince them to fall in line in order to get a unanimous vote on some sort of production cuts which may not even be worded as reduced output
related the saudi dilemma to cut or not to cutdays before the december meeting in vienna qatar surprisingly announced on monday that it would be quitting opec as of january as it focuses on natural to iran s kazempour qatar is not the only one frustrated with opec s recent decisions especially the ones taken by the joint ministerial monitoring committee jmmc there are many other opec members frustrated that the jmmc is deciding on production unilaterally and without the required prior consensus of opec kazempour told opec members may need some convincing but a higher price of oil is not an insignificant argument for many of the cartel members who can t balance their budgets at a barrel looks like saudi arabia and russia are ready to continue managing the oil market and will have their way one way or they can t get consensus on a wording with million barrels per day of cuts they can always bet on a vague statement of market stability declaration of cooperation to adjust compliance levels open to tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
