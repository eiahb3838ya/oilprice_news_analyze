how sanctions are helping the u.s. become a net oil exporter
it s easy to forget now but just a few short years ago the united states was the biggest oil importer in the world by a considerable margin and sold exactly zero barrels internationally thanks to laws prohibiting the export of oil
this now sounds like an absurdity thanks to the shale oil and gas renaissance ushered in by that has allowed the to become a major oil exporter to europe and asia alike
now thanks to political turmoil and oil sanctions in exporting powerhouses iran and venezuela the is ready to step into their place and inch ever closer to what was once unthinkable becoming a net oil a global oil trading industry gathering last september oil producers from the united states came well prepared to usher in the new era of oil exports
exxon mobil for one along with their european competitor royal dutch shell came armed with brochures explaining in detail the different grades of crudes as well as all the reasons they are the perfect replacement for oil traditionally bought from middle east africa and russia for import to far the strategy has been a smashing success
oil exports to europe have hit record highs over the last year doubling over the course of to reach barrels per day bpd
this year exports have continued to soar breaking records already in january with bpd sent to europe alone
while this is still less than imports from russia or iraq it puts the ahead of other opec producers like nigeria and libya
related where will putin build his next gas pipeline a big factor in the massive success of crude in overseas markets is the massive amount of output from the permian basin creating a crude glut and driving down crude prices to a level that international markets are to compete with

crude is a real headache
it puts a lot of pressure on regional light grades
in fact prices for all grades are affected because it is such a significant extra supply a european trader representing russian oil was quoted as saying by major oil producers have already been forced to lower their own prices and enforce production caps
opec and other outside producers like russia have cut their output by percent since in an attempt to combat falling oil prices
the strategy has been a successful one for the most part with prices doubling from their lowest point up to per barrel but without a doubt the international market will continue to feel the squeeze over the course of the united states crude glut and subsequent low prices is only going to continue to grow over the next year
according to government statistics in crude production is projected to skyrocket another million bpd over last year reaching an expected approximate average of million bpd
looking further than predictions show that crude could grow to reach up to million bpd of crude and up to million bpd of total oil liquids
with these numbers the country would be able to be completely producing more than enough to feed the domestic demand of million bpd
related trade deal could boost gasoline priceswhile crude volume and prices have been the driving factor of the nation s rising influence in international oil markets it s certainly not the only factor
in this case as in almost every other economy can not be divorced from politics
sanctions on venezuela and iran have lent a big helping hand discouraging nations around the world from buying oil from the two targeted nations lest they fall into the bad graces of the world s largest economy
the numbers that the is celebrating now bpd to europe over is around the same level that iranian imports were at before the iran nuclear deal was revoked and a fresh round of sanctions were politics in venezuela more volatile than ever with some notable encouragement from the and trump s stance showing no signs of slowing it looks like foreign policy will continue to spell major success for crude in the european and asian haley zaremba for top reads from
