opecâ€™s next big crisis
opec is having some success in heading off another oil market downturn but over the the cartel faces much more serious opec production growth outlook over the medium term remains clouded by ongoing sanctions geopolitical risks competitive supply low oil prices and demand concerns bank of america merrill lynch wrote in a new
production has soared over the past and continues to rise
surging output from texas shale fields has forced opec to back out production in order to avoid a price crash
in the years ahead however opec will continue to struggle
opec may not bring a huge amount of new capacity online which could erode its position
in our view opec capacity additions during the past six years will exceed additions over the next six bofaml analysts and opec members added around million barrels per day of new capacity
projects came online in a variety of countries including iraq iran west africa and the gulf states
iraq in particular added huge volumes of new supply recovering after years of war
output from iraq has more than doubled since and recently topped
but future iraqi projects which promised to dramatically ratchet up production even from today s high levels were put on ice in recent years after isis overran the country in the next six years new additions will probably be smaller and concentrated in fewer countries
bank of america merrill lynch only sees of new capacity from opec mostly from iran
related the biggest threat to oil market stabilitynot only will capacity growth start to slow but opec production will begin to erode on an absolute basis falling from in to just in
as a result opec loses market share in the global oil is not because of a lack of reserves
the oil is still there
opec still holds about of total global oil reserves with the reserves in saudi arabia and venezuela vastly exceeding those in any other country
but demand is already starting to slow and growth will decelerate in the years ahead leaving little room for new supply
shale is expected to add barrels onto the market so opec will be forced to maintain supply curbs in order to prevent prices from projects that do move forward in opec countries will need to be extremely attractive with an average breakeven at per barrel or lower according to bank of america merrill lynch
that compares to the percent of projects given the greenlight over the next six years with an average breakeven price at per other words opec has cheaper oil but many opec members are victims of sanctions underinvestment and other geopolitical risk
iraq and iran are obvious flashpoints
iraq has suffered from violence and political crises while iran could be under sanctions for years to come

regime change could bring in a new government which would likely be friendlier to oil multinationals
but even with a new government rebuilding the country s decrepit oil sector would take years and tens of billions of bofaml predicts of new opec capacity through roughly half of that is technical which means development is uncertain and may not occur at while geopolitical events restrain supply an even bigger threat to opec is the dramatic slowdown in demand expected in the years ahead
bank of america merrill lynch recently predicted that the world would see peak oil demand by
demand slows significantly along the way with growth halving by relative to declining demand growth and strong supply growth leave little room for incremental opec barrels bank of america merrill lynch nick cunningham of top reads from
