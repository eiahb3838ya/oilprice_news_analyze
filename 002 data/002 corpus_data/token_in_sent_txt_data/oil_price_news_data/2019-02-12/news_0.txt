fifty shades of shale oil
the rise of tight oil production over the last several years has upended the oil market and challenged opec s hold on oil prices
this seemingly relentless growth in tight oil production has created the impression that oil prices will remain forever capped as each price spike is met by a massive wave of us tight oil
tight oil supply has grown from a mere barrels in to just under barrels in
following the oil crash of late tight oil growth experienced a brief pause in before resuming its growth in and climbing to a new high by
this latest growth spurt to a new record is even more impressive when we take in consideration the fact that wti averaged a barrel in as compared to a barrel in the three years preceding the oil crash
click to enlarge source opec woo most observers attribute this strong shale industry performance to technology and improved drilling and completion practices
we are told that american oil and gas companies have become more efficient
the widespread utilization of pad drilling the introduction of longer laterals pumping ever more sand per foot closer and better well spacing and smart fracture targeting are often mentioned as the driving factors behind the industry record beating performance
this narrative of technological prowess and innovation is an attractive one but a deeper examination of the data reveals a different this fallacious narrative of the tight oil industry overcoming the oil price crash of through innovation and better efficiency is the product of bundling various tight oil basins under one umbrella and the presentation of the resulting production data as a proof shale properly understand the impact of the oil price crash of on tight oil production one must focus on shale basins with sufficient operating history prior to the oil price crash and examine their performance post the crash
to that end the bakken and the eagle ford are the perfect specimen
the bakken and the eagle ford are the two oldest tight oil basins in the united states with the former developed as early as and the latter in
examining the production performance of these two basins in the years preceding the oil crash and contrasting it to the years subsequent to it offers important insight as to the resiliency of tight oil production in a low oil price environment

the eagle ford grew from practically nothing in to barrels by while the bakken grew five fold from barrels to barrels
following the collapse in oil prices in late the bakken and eagle ford growth continued for another year albeit at a slower pace as the momentum carried production to new highs
however by both the bakken and the eagle ford went into a decline and have hardly recovered since
it took the bakken three years to match its production level meanwhile the eagle ford production remains below its peak
during the years these two fields grew by a combined yearly average of to barrels from to
post the oil price collapse this torrid growth turned into a sizable decline by before stabilizing in
growth in both fields only resumed in at a combined yearly rate of barrels a reduction from the combined fields growth rate
the dismal performance of these two fields over the last few years paints a different picture as to tight oil resiliency in a low oil price environment
the sizable declines and muted production growth in both the bakken and the eagle ford since discredit the leap in technology and the efficiency gains narrative that has been espoused as the underlying reason beyond the strong growth in oil production
as we expand our look into other tight oil basins it becomes apparent that it was neither technology or efficiency that saved the tight oil industry although these factors may have played a supporting role
in simple terms the key reason as to the strength of production since the oil crash is better rock or rather the commercial exploitation of a higher quality shale resource namely the permian oil field
click to enlarge source opec woo the permian oil field unlike the bakken and the eagle ford was a relative latecomer to the tight oil story
it was only in only a year before the oil crash that the industry commenced full scale development of that giant field s shale resources
prior to the permian lagged both the bakken and the eagle ford in total tight oil production and growth
as can be seen from the preceding graph the oil crash had only a minor dampening effect on the permian oil production growth
by permian tight oil growth resumed at a healthy clip and by permian tight oil production growth shattered a new record with production skyrocketing by barrels in a single year to barrels
this timely unlocking and exploitation of the permian oil basin masked to a large degree the devastation endured by the bakken and the eagle ford post
in essence the tight oil story has two phases masquerading as one the period marked by the birth and rise of the bakken and eagle ford and the period marked by the rise of the permian
to speak of the tight oil industry as one is to mistake a relay race for the accomplishment of a single runner
related which oil giant generates the most cash the performance divergence between the bakken eagle ford and the permian has major implications as to the likelihood of tight oil production suppressing oil price over the medium and long term
a close examination of tight oil production data leads to a single indisputable conclusion without the advent of the permian the tight oil industry would have lost the opec lead price war
hence it s a misnomer to treat the tight oil industry as a monolith in many ways the bakken and the eagle ford tight oil fields are as much a victim of the permian success as the opec nations themselves
implications this discordant panoply of shale fields known as the tight oil industry has been the key source of global oil supply growth over the last several years and is expected to be for years to come click to enlarge considering that the majority of tight oil production growth is generated by a single field the permian changes in the growth outlook of this basin have major implications as to the evolution of global oil prices over the short medium and long term
its important to keep in mind that the permian oil field despite its large scope is bound to flatten peak and decline at some point
while forecasters differ as to the exact year when the permian oil production will flatten the majority agree that a slowdown in permian oil production growth will take place in the early to opec world oil outlook the permian basin oil production curve is likely to flatten by with growth slowing down from barrels in to a mere barrels by click to enlarge source opec woo there are many factors that can accelerate or delay the projected flattening phase but there is no doubt that sooner or later permian oil production will flatten
an eventual plateau in permian oil supply effectively translates into a flattening of global oil supply the importance of this event can t be overstated
the year the permian flattens is the year opec will regain control of the market this seminal event will have major implications on long term oil prices
there is no doubt that saudi arabia and russia are aware of the permian growth and flattening dynamic and are their oil supply over the short term and medium term to allow for an orderly entrance of tight oil supply aka permian oil supply into the market
it s indeed telling that opec is attempting to extend its alliance with russia for another three years exactly the time window required for growth in the permian oil field to flatten and for pricing power to return to tight oil story is far more complex than meets the eye and the oil market like any market is prone to the appeal of simple narratives and false conclusions
those willing to drill behind the headlines stand to capitalize on the treasures buried in the details
