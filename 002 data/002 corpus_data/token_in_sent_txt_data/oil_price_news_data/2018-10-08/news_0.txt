north sea oil renaissance could flop
last year when oilprice wrote about a rush of investments into north sea oil and gas it looked like that part of the oil world was undergoing a seismic shift with big oil being replaced by leaner private field operators that wood mackenzie said could turn things around
technology helped too
things were looking up for one of the oldest regions in the world
now the big oil exodus continues and some analysts and industry insiders worry that the recovery of the north sea may falter in the not too distant there s been a string of deals in the north sea equinor earlier this month said it had agreed to buy chevron s stake in rosebank one of the largest undeveloped oil and gas finds in the british section of the north sea
for chevron the deal is part of a larger plan to exit the north sea in full
marathon oil announced it would leave the north sea too and would instead focus on its domestic recently an independent company enquest bought the remainder of bp s stake in the magnus field
bp went on a selling spree in the north sea last year and even offloaded its forties pipeline
another local independent verus petroleum paid million for stakes in several fields sold by japanese profit secrets of the world s most successful energy investors the japanese deal is worth noting s p global platts recently reported some in the industry were worried about the exit of japanese companies from the north sea
it quoted an unnamed source as saying japanese investors in the north sea were fed up with project delays and cost overruns so they were leaving for good
japan effectively made its decision about the north sea about three years ago
they would say the operations in the north sea are at all efficient
largely those criticisms were right
in many ways they still even right now the source told s p global the same time there are all these private companies flocking to the north sea so all should be good right
only it s not exactly all good
a september report from industry body oil and gas uk warned drilling in the north sea is at the lowest since and in the near future capacity constraint might emerge across the supply said the body also noted that operating costs have fallen by as much as percent and average us a barrel and that production this year will likely be percent higher than four years ago before the price collapse really hit
the oil and gas authority adds in its latest industry overview that breakeven level in the north sea is now below us per barrel of falling operating costs and breakeven prices and with all this private equity money flowing into mature fields and new discoveries the picture emerges as overall positive for the north sea
yet it could be even better were the government willing to lend a helping would say it already did when it slashed taxes for the oil and gas industry a couple of years ago but this slashing came too soon after a tax rise in creating a feeling of uncertainty among delicate investor souls
this according to analysts and industry insiders s p global platts spoke to means investors are not all that willing to enter the north sea at least not the british north sea
we chosen to invest heavily in norway because of many things but its fiscal stability is one of those things
the uk and its instability from a fiscal perspective is a massive detractor and will be for others says the ceo of faroe petroleum graham stewart
the picture for this part of the oil world in other words remains irina slav for top reads from
