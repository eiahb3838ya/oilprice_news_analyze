the overlooked factor that could derail the opec deal
while the continuing discussions are dominating headlines with a focus on a possible extension of the oil production cut agreement into the market is far from geopolitical tensions currently stemming from syria and iran have already pushed oil and natural gas prices up
the statements made by the international energy agency and opec ministers in paris suggest that the markets may be stabilizing but these reports may be premature
as opec and russia continue to cut production crude oil inventories are shrinking worldwide but a new threat is emerging in oil s fastest growing market has been a steady growth market for middle east and african oil suppliers but the government has recently vented their displeasure with opec s asian premium approach for oil and gas prices
additionally china and russia are looking to quell the power of the petrodollar further amplifying instability in global oil fundamentals are undeniably improving
kuwait s oil minister bakheet al rashidi stated during a summit that he expects opec to extend the production cut agreement in june with the possiblilty of said extension continuing into something that will likely be decided at the end of
kuwait s views are in line with several main opec producers such as saudi arabia and the uae
russia too seems to be on board with this s optimism about current market developments is growing
opec s secretary general mohamed barkindo stated to the press that oecd commercial crude oil inventories are currently less than million barrels over the average
in oecd levels were million barrels above
omani oil minister mohammed al rumhy however has openly criticized recent statements by opec
he warned that the job is not done at all
uncertainty still persists in large parts of the market
related jp morgan oil prices wo go higher than rumhy reiterated that russia cooperation is needed to quell any possible stumbling blocks in the market but also to quell possible new pressure from asian consumers
oil investments are still needed to keep production flowing while additional volumes are needed to counter growing asian new challenge for mena oil producers will be the fact that asian consumers are starting to work against the asian premium minister of petroleum dharmendra pradhan already stated to the press that india in close cooperation with china and other japanese consumers will be pushing for changes to the asian premium contracts of opec
sanjiv singh chairman of indian oil corporation and wan yalin chairman of china s oil giant cnpc will be setting up a strategy to force opec to set a new and fairer price for asian customers
this could be a major blow to arab and iranian oil producers as it could lower overall revenues an asian standpoint the call for change is fair especially as china indian japan and south korea are the main consumers of middle east oil gas
the historic approach of an asian premium was partly based on more costly transportation and high demand for crude and gas in european and markets
the removal of real competition between east and west of suez has led to an almost exclusive oil and gas trade strategy between mena producers and asian s overall position has increased due to economic growth and soaring energy consumption
when looking at the asian consumers it no longer seems fair to pay more for the same product
a possible coordinated price change demand by the asian tigers including india could put arab and iranian oil volumes under increased price and russia also need to adjust to a new situation in which asian consumers are no longer willing to pay for a commodity that could be replaced by alternative energy sources such as wind and solar
the willingness to pivot to other energy sources should not be underestimated any longer
asian consumers such as china or japan could change their energy consumption behavior rather quickly as governmental policy plays a large role in forming the consumption patterns of these countries
related the world s most profitable oil majorfor opec the asian developments should hold a single message
further coordination between the world s largest oil exporters is needed to counter not only shale but consumer behavior in the rest of the world
a dramatic change in attitude in asia could be leading to a disaster within years if no concerted efforts are in place in the producers and moscow can and will be able to address their concerns with the respective governments in beijing tokyo delhi or seoul
without a real concerted effort opec is going to lose if moscow choses to play by its own s joint ministerial monitoring committee set up by saudi arabia algeria oman venezuela and kuwait will meet this week in jeddah
the output curbs should be on the agenda but asian premium discussions also should be addressed
discussing the market should not be restricted to rig numbers production volumes or storage utilizations worldwide
price settings in asia ongoing pressure on the dollar denomination of crude oil and gas and geopolitics should play a significant role in these internal discussions
prolonging or extending production cuts would be a sign of the alliance s willingness to cooperate but addressing the other issues could be a first step along a path to an improved power position for the cartel in the s mission is not accomplished
their ultimate goal is still just a speck on the horizon and currently there does appear to be a highway to drive cyril widdershoven for top reads from
