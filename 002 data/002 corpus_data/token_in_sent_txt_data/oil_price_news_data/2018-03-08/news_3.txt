is arctic drilling the key to u.s. energy dominance?
energy dominance is a term that has become almost synonymous with trump s administration
on the face of things it may seem that the term requires no further analysis for a deeper understanding surely it is simply as it sounds the ability to dominate the energy market
but trump s tweet this morning calls that understanding into question
click to enlarge it isn t unfeasible to suppose that the word jobs is there as an attempt to answer any detractors to the policy but security is another matter entirely
it seems energy dominance isn t simply about energy independence but rather about political and economic mccarrick the deputy assistant secretary at the state department s bureau of energy resources has talked about the asian energy markets specifically china painting the policy of dominance as a means to equalling trade imbalances and level the market playing field
yet it is europe a market over which russia has something of a stranglehold where things get much more interesting
it is here that energy exports seem to be a direct challenge to russia s tactics
indeed trump own wording cites the policy as a means to help its allies and partners become more resilient against those that use energy to related oil export boom boosts pipeline demandit seems then that the thirst for oil as a means for satiating oil companies profits is in complete accord with government policy and that the current shale oil boom is the result of a cycle that feeds and replenishes both parties
iea forecasts that put oil production above russia s in the not too distant future may yet be mere hyperbole so it may indeed be prudent to bolster those forecasts by securing more reliable sources of in anticipation of this very policy the obama administration attempted to preemptively block it with an executive order that aimed to protect huge portions of the arctic and atlantic oceans from oil and gas exploitation
while at the time it may have seemed to some a foolproof way of safeguarding these areas indefinitely last month trump put paid to that idea when his administration unveiled a plan that would permit drilling of the outer continental shelf ocs certainly still a long way from actual drilling the plan has opened the floodgates of oil exploration and generated ire form many parties including businesses that rely on tourism and environmental groups
though this idea may not be surprising the plan is also at risk of pitting the administration against more than half of the states that stand to directly be affected by it
of those states have expressed clear opposition while have fully endorsed it
one other state has endorsed it providing that all relevant environmental and societal issues are fully addressed
the rest have either not stated a position or simply not are certainly some that believe public and private backlash will kill off this proposal before it comes to fruition
others may argue that drilling companies will treat this as a hot potato preferring to keep well away from anything that had bp reeling after the deepwater horizon disaster in which has purportedly cost them billion
many more may argue that the protections put in place after that disaster simply make such an undertaking too iea predicts nightmare scenario for opecthe problem with the latter position is that the administration already has an answer for it
the interior department s bureau of safety and environmental enforcement has stated it plans to reduc e the regulatory burden on in other words repeal the regulations that were implemented to ensure disasters like deepwater horizon never happen seems that any expectation that drilling companies will stay away is indeed unfounded with industry associations and the same number of companies showing interest in all of the proposed sites
surely then there is some money to be made but with a lack of pacific infrastructure currently in place perhaps this interest is more about those companies and associations protecting their longevity rather than tapping viable real question is whether such a move has any relevance in a world that is shifting further and further away from fossil fuels and whether it can stand up to such stiff gary norman for top reads from
