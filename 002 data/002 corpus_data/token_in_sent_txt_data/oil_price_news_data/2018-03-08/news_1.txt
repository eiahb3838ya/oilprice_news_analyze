oil and gas is under attack in latin america
the energy reform has a lot of benefits to the country to the people so the worst case scenario in my point of view is that the speed that we are implementing the energy reform will be reduced the ceo of mexico s oil company pemex told the ceraweek conference this trevino was referring to the upcoming presidential election in mexico in which the frontrunner andres manuel lopez obrador aka amlo has hinted that he might roll back the historic energy reform passed a few years ago that opened up the country s energy sector to the private sector
someone who doesn t believe in the energy reform may reduce the speed very much and i think that would be a shame in mexico trevino said clearly referring to was originally against the privatization effort which has allowed the participation of international oil majors after decades of monopoly over energy
more recently however he has softened his tone voicing skepticism rather than outright opposition
still amlo says he will slow down the pace of auctions perhaps halting them until success can be demonstrated from all of the offerings already awarded to international there won t be new oil auctions until we assess the results delivered by the first auction rocio nahle a congresswoman and expected pick to be amlo s energy advisor told the wsj in a recent interview
but the amlo administration would not cancel contracts as some in the oil industry fear
investors can be calm we ll respect the law she to bloomberg more than contracts have been inked with companies such as royal dutch shell chevron exxonmobil eni and others
the most attractive assets as of now are in mexico s deepwater in the gulf of mexico
however it will be several more years before the fruits of this effort can be realized which raises questions about what the amlo administration might do in the meantime
related china plans record natural gas coal production in s trevino says rolling back the energy liberalization would be almost impossible because to change the energy reform you will need to change the still amlo could slow the effort and put an end to new auctions
moreover his administration has sent signals that it would focus on increasing downstream capacity while curtailing crude oil exports
slumping refining output has forced the country to step up imports of gasoline and diesel
public investment in refineries could reverse that trend his campaign argues
in a period at the latest we need to try to consume our own fuels and not depend on foreign gasoline nahle told an amlo election as seems the most likely scenario at this point raises a lot of questions in regards to what happens with mexico s energy mexico isn t the only country in latin america that presents some political risk to oil and gas
a new report from verisk maplecroft says that latin america s election presents a series of potential obstacles for ongoing oil and gas development
mexico may top the list but voters are also heading to the polls in colombia brazil and venezuela this common thread that runs through all of these countries is a growing impatience on the part of voters with traditional establishment political parties
unconventional candidates pledging to clean up corruption are colombia o il output will continue to slip and new investment will dampen if the incoming administration fails to provide greater legal certainty surrounding permits verisk maplecroft said
colombia extractive sector has been under unusual stress over the last two years the global risk firm said pointing to environmental opposition to oil and gas drilling
a large number of candidates outside major political parties makes it difficult to predict the there is just as much uncertainty regarding the upcoming election in brazil
the deeply unpopular current president is not running while the candidate leading in the polls former president luiz inacio lula da silva might be barred from running
verisk maplecroft says that the oil and gas sector would face greater risk if lula were to win
absent his candidacy his former environment minister marina silva could prevail who has trumpeted a greater focus on renewable energy and environmental oil prices slip after eia reports build in crude inventoriesstill the risk in brazil is lower compared to elsewhere
we do not expect either of them to have the congressional support required to undo temer reforms says jimena blanco head of americas research at verisk maplecroft
given the scale of the investment needed to fully develop the no government is likely to stray too far from the current trajectory
no country presents more risk than venezuela where increasingly autocratic president nicolas maduro is hoping to kill off the last vestiges of democracy
he is expected to win out despite the dramatic economic meltdown although s ocial turmoil could force the military to assume a caretaker role if things take a significant turn for the worse though verisk maplecroft past few years have seen governments court oil and gas companies in many parts of latin america aside from venezuela but the tide now seems to flowing in the other nick cunningham of top reads from
