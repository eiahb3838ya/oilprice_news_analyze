cheaper natural gas is coming to europe
the european union recently updated its gas pipeline rules in a bid to assuage concerns about its deepening dependence on russian gas
the move was generally praised by nord stream opponents but guardedly since the update did not halt the project but will merely slow it
however controversial the project will be among the factors that will benefit gas consumers in europe amid stiffer competition from other exporters of natural the largest gas market in europe and biggest buyer of russian gas as well as the strongest supporter of nord stream said it will build two lng terminals as part of efforts to diversify its sources of the fuel as it phases out coal and nuclear power plants under pressure from the green lobby
lng is a natural candidate for these terminals but not the only one russia s novatek also exports lng to europe and since its yamal plant is quite a bit closer to the continent than cheniere energy s sabine pass plant its prices are more means russia is playing on the european gas market with two players rather than just one and that would make it more challenging for lng to grab a bigger market share
yet the challenge can be overcome as deputy energy secretary dan brouillette said earlier this year during a visit to germany as more lng production capacity comes on stream in the united states prices will fall further making the commodity competitive with russian piped gas and russian doubt how soon this will happen and one of these is commodity strategist christopher louney from rbc capital
last month louney told cnbc europe taking lng and lng challenging russian pipeline supplies for dominance are two very different things
europe has already taken lng over the past two years with just a couple of export terminals in operation
with more export facilities coming online the number of takers and volume taken can both increase but there is a long way to go to compete with russia for
it won t happen overnight in other words but lng does have a promising future in europe
related does saudi arabia really have as much oil as analysts think but there is another competitor that will be joining the race soon the pipeline which will carry natural gas from the caspian sea to europe
tap is a key part of the southern gas key infrastructure project for europe aimed at diversifying gas supplies away from russia and bringing natural gas from the caspian sea region to european markets
the southern gas corridor consists of several separate energy projects with a total investment of around us billion
the us shah deniz gas development in azerbaijan which bp and its partners started up in july last year is the starting point of the southern gas more gas is coming into europe over the next few years and demand will likely continue growing as it has been for the last four years according to figures from the oxford energy institute
as is usually the case more supply will pressure prices and stimulate even stronger demand
this may add a challenge to producers efforts to keep their prices low but profitable but the challenge is just part of the irina slav for top reads from
