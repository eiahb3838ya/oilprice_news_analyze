canadian crude could remain ‘cheap’ for years to come
the amount of oil available for export from canada exceeded its takeaway pipeline capacity by about bpd at the end of forcing steep discounts for canadian discount for western canada select wcs relative to wti hit per barrel late last year after the temporary outage of the keystone pipeline
while that problem was resolved the wcs discount has largely been stuck at about the same level through early problem for canadian oil producers is that some new oil sands projects came online late last year adding new supply
at the end of last year canadian output stood bpd higher compared to two years earlier despite no major pipelines coming online in that timeframe
now producers are fighting for space on the nation s major pipelines while new projects remain mired in limbo due to a mix of environmental opposition regulatory hurdles and legal problem won t be resolved in the near future even as upstream production continues to come online
with no new investments in and production forecast to grow we expect line space shortages to become more acute the iea wrote in its new oil bottleneck has put more pressure on the rail industry but for various reasons rail probably won t solve the industry s problems
rail is not optimal in any case costing as much as to per barrel more to ship oil to the gulf coast compared to the same route via pipeline according to the iea
related shell takes major steps toward energy diversification while rail shipments have picked up in recent months and there is plenty of notional capacity new rail car standards which resulted in the decommissioning of a lot of older units competition from grain exports and a lack of trained staff have made it hard to ramp up exports quickly the iea rail companies are not going to make investments in new rail capacity based on oil market conditions that might clear up in two or three years
the standoff has hampered rail flows and may well continue over the next few months the iea might begin to pick up some slack but the pipeline problem could last a lot longer than a few months
the three main projects on the drawing board all still face significant challenges trans mountain expansion kinder morgan s proposed twin pipeline that would run alongside an existing line would nearly triple the system s capacity to bpd carrying alberta oil to the pacific coast in british columbia
the project has the backing of the federal government but not the bc provincial government
it also has run into opposition from first nations and environmental groups
if it moves forward the project probably wouldn t come online until at the earliest according to the iea which ranks the likelihood of the project getting off the ground as keystone xl like a zombie this project refuses to die despite a decade of legal haggling
transcanada s infamous pipeline has been approved by the trump administration but faces legal troubles in nebraska where state regulators only approved it for an alternative route opening the project up to new legal problems
meanwhile the pipeline company still hasn t given it a final investment decision amid reports last year that it was struggling to line up customers
the iea says this project is also uncertain but if it moved forward it wouldn t come online until line expansion enbridge is hoping to upgrade and overhaul its existing line which runs from hardisty alberta to superior wisconsin allowing canadian oil to move to the midwest for refining
enbridge has received the from canada but is still awaiting permits from the state of minnesota and a decision could still be a few more months away
still the iea says this project is the most likely to go forward and could begin operations at the end of next year
related shale boom could create a refining bottleneckin short canada s pipeline problems could be resolved with the addition of one or two projects but in the most optimistic scenario that could be nearly two years away
the iea forecasts capacity rising by bpd by the end of largely because it assumes the completion of the line upstream oil production trickles online the iea sees canadian output exceeding pipeline capacity through which will force producers to turn to rail
and while there are snags on canadian railways once those are resolved exports from canada will enjoy a renaissance growing from their current to an implied on average in and in the iea concludes
the agency says that shipments could peak at bpd in could help ease some pressure for oil producers though not all of it
wcs trades at a more than discount to wti right now because of both the backlog on the nation s pipeline system and the inability of the rail industry to quickly ramp up oil shipments
the iea says the discount will fall back a bit to per barrel as rail picks up some slack
but that discount might not narrow any further until new pipelines are nick cunningham of top reads from
