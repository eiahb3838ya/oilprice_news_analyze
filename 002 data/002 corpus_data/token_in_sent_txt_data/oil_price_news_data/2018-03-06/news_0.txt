shale pioneer issues warning to u.s. drillers
shale has effectively upended the oil industry with predictions that total oil production will surpass saudi arabia s output this year in turn rivalling russia s to become the preeminent global producer
from its position of being dependent on and subordinate to opec the has seemingly become the big bad wolf
through a catalogue of tactical errors and misplaced belief in its own muscle the mighty brick edifice of opec has begun to look more like a bundle of international energy agency iea forecasts that the will become a net energy exporter by the late but how accurate is that forecast and to what extent is it mere hyperbole
in october last year there were already caveats about the nature of shale with some warning that aggressive expansion was leading to rapid initial growth that would ultimately peak too soon
mark papa former head of eog resources nyse eog raised the question of flatlining output in the face of the doubling of the oil rig count h ow can a rig count be double and yet production be stagnant
figures have also been influenced by the rapid pace of technological development a pace which has itself plateaued
robert clarke woodmac research director for lower upstream said that i f future wells are not offset by continued technology evolution the permian may peak in
iea forecasts then may be based on rapid growth and technological development that simply isn t sustainable

the iea is still forecasting that the will be the number one oil exporter by at million bpd but at the ceraweek conference in houston on tuesday papa is set to turn that thinking on its head when he warns the industry that shale will hit roadblocks that prevent such forecasts from being realized
he says the best drilling locations in north dakota and south texas are already tapped out
the oil market is in a state of misdirection now papa told the wsj
someone needs to speak how much of this is indeed misdirection on his part
papa is ceo at centennial resource development nasdaq cdev which holds the rights to acres in the delaware of the permian
a slowdown in expansion and its potential consequence of increased oil prices is advantageous to centennial s shareholders so who are we to believe guilty of misdirection a more conservative rate of growth may simply be desired by some but it also may be an inevitability
kevin holt chief investment officer of invesco value equities has said that the situation many companies find themselves in is in part a consequence of the link between their leaders pay and production growth rather than returns on investment
this has fostered a drilling frenzy that has resulted in an explosion of production an unregulated drilling frenzy that may be at odds with the long term survival of those companies
investors have subsequently demanded a more conservative approach to drilling which appears to be having a stabilizing effect

these pressures shape the nature of the market and also make it difficult to predict the longevity of tight oil reserves and the ability of companies to exploit them
another significant factor is regulation
how long will trump s epa remain the castrated shadow of its former self and how long until it begins to bare its own teeth is papa s anticipated warning about to shake up the industry
or is it merely the continuation of the chorus of restraint that many in the industry have been voicing in this period of massive growth and upheaval
ultimately the industry will decide whether it will be eating out of papa s hand or persist in biting the hand that feeds gary norman for
