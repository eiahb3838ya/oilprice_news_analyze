why arenâ€™t permian oil producers profitable?
the wall street journal recently reported that only five of the top oil companies focused mostly on hydraulic fracking generated more cash than they spent in the first quarter of this year
this continues a trend that has been ongoing throughout the fracking and losersthe article doesn t list the cash flow picture for the entire top nor did it explain how it calculated cash flow
but based on the numbers they reported and my own analysis it appears they are defining cash flow as simply the amount of cash generated from operations minus capital story indicated that overall companies spent for every they took in
it further noted that oasis petroleum spent for every it made in cash while parsley energy spent almost for every it made in hedging was blamed for the underwhelming cash flow
the article noted that many producers hedged oil prices at to a barrel and were therefore unable to cash in on the rally in oil prices
of course that makes you wonder why a company would hedge at a price that they should have known would result in negative cash resources infamously ditched its hedges in after oil prices declined to
the company expected prices to bounce back quickly
continental hasn t yet resumed hedging but expects to do so at some point
notably continental was reported to have the highest cash flow among its peers at million for
eog resources was also highlighted for generating a million cash surplus for the quarter
related higher prices to help oil companies refinance in debtthe article doesn t name the other companies that generated positive cash flow but i screened the data from the s p global market intelligence database and calculated it myself
the numbers i calculated for continental and eog matched the numbers reported in the wsj article so i used the same calculation for the rest of the the wsj story didn t include conocophillips in its analysis as it led all oil companies considering just the pure oil and gas producers with cash flow of million for the quarter
cop is the largest pure oil and gas producer and like continental they aren t hedged
but their oil and gas operations are geographically diverse and they aren t purely a fracking companies generating positive cash flow among the largest oil and gas producers by enterprise value excluding the supermajor integrated companies were eqt at million chesapeake at million cabot oil gas at million and cimarex at million
the biggest overall cash flow loser in the top was pioneer natural resources which outspent its cash flow by permian winnersnotably despite the surge of oil production in the permian basin none of the companies that generated positive cash flow in operate either exclusively or mostly within the permian basin
related is a natural gas pipeline between alaska and china realistic continental operates primarily in two areas the bakken in north dakota and the in oklahoma
eog has operations scattered across the midcontinent as well as some international production
conocophillips has a diverse production portfolio
the others generating positive cash flow are primarily natural gas companies or have a large chunk of production outside of the lack of cash flow among permian producers can be partially attributed to logistical constraints in the permian that won t likely be relieved until
but it s also a function of companies investing heavily into the permian in anticipation of future be clear it isn t necessarily a concern if a company occasionally has negative cash flow
companies invest for the future and if their outlook is for higher oil prices then they may invest significantly
but this increases the level of risk for these companies as a prolonged oil price slump could financially strain the big conclusion i will note that most oil companies are moving in the right direction even if some aren t doing so quickly enough
my screen of the top and canadian oil and gas companies showed cumulative cash flow from the group at million for
a year ago that number was robert rapiermore top reads from
