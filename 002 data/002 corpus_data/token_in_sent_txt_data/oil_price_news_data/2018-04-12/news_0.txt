the six factors driving oil markets in 2018
uncertainty appears to have returned to oil markets of late with a cluster of factors battling for influence over oil bulls are very content with the vienna deal its success hitherto and the prospects of another extension
the coming summer driving season is sure to boost this bullish sentiment as demand looks set to jump
trump s recent political reshuffle and the impact that may have on the termination of the iran nuclear deal and the associated geopolitical tensions in the add still more upside for bears can counter these arguments by questioning the longevity of the vienna oil deal pointing to the rising prospects of trade war between china and the and highlighting the incredible growth in shale production
for the rest of the year it will be the between these bullish and bearish factors that control where prices s be honest
bulls have largely dominated the market while bears appear to have gone into hiding
the bullish factors have been quite prominent in the news of late and summer driving season is finally upon us
the summer driving season starts in april and ends in september with different peak periods
millions of cars hit the road as families head out on vacation
this results in increased gasoline consumption forcing refineries to consume more oil to meet the demand
in combination with other factors the uptick in demand due to driving season will definitely provide some upside for oil prices
related is oil demand growth overrated as well as driving season donald trump s administration will soon formally the iran deal known as joint comprehensive plan of action
the sacking of national security adviser mcmaster who was replaced by john bolton has signaled that the administration is likely to take a more hawkish stance against iran
it is well known that john bolton has no taste for soft diplomacy
it is expected that on may the united states will likely cancel jcpoa
oil prices spiked on the news of bolton s appointment and they will likely spike again if the agreement is indeed cancelled
however it remains to be seen whether this will be a long term bullish factor for oil prices or if it is largely a sentiment bulls and bears will be watching opec s june meeting carefully
if the countries not only reiterate their commitment which may include extending the deal till oil prices are likely to rally
however if the meeting ends without action or the common opec jawboning it is likely that prices will fall
if whispers of an exit are heard confidence in oil markets may drop dramatically and bears will likely come rushing other factors should analysts look for when it comes to driving crude prices down in the coming year
one of the most notable is the brewing trade war between two of the biggest economic behemoths of the world usa and china
as mentioned above the increasingly hawkish administration may chance the face of foreign policy and in this case it will likely be bearish for oil markets
trump has proposed steel and aluminum tariffs percent on former and percent on latter
he is looking to impose a further billion of tariffs in other areas
china quickly retaliated to these first sanctions and has claimed that it will match trump s every step in this regard
trump is now planning another billion tariff plan for china
talk of a fully blown trade war may be premature but the first signs are certainly there
oil prices have fallen each time that the trade war escalates with one key consequence of a trade war being a fall in oil demand as exports to the world s largest oil consumer fall
while the iran wild card may threaten to push oil prices up a trade war between china and the would have the opposite strong demand not opec is pushing oil prices higheras with all discussions in global oil markets today the remarkable growth of shale growth can not be avoided
with production touching mbpd and only growing the downward pressure in markets from shale could be very significant in the right environment
the eia says that us crude oil output will rise to mbpd next year a revision from mbpd from last month
fatih birol speaking during international energy forum recently said that another wave of shale oil is on its way and added that beyond the there will be growth in offshore production from brazil and parts of africa as well
this production is all being driven by the recent rise in oil prices forming what could become a vicious circle for oil markets
one bit of good news that oil analysts can take from this however is that firms appear to have learnt their lessons from the oil price crash
shale companies have hedged a large portion of production and are finally becoming profitable for and bears will continue to clash in the oil markets and while bulls currently have the upper hand it is unlikely they will maintain their dominance all year
among the factors mentioned above some are temporary geopolitical some are uncertain opec and some are more or less permanent shale growth
analysts should focus on trends watching each of these factors and understanding how different outcomes may move osama rizvi for top reads from
