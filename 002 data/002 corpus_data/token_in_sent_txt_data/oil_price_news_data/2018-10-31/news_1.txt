u.s. oil to significantly outperform this year
on the morning of publication of the and eia psm reports today october providing us monthly oil production data for august rystad energy analysis indicates that the market should expect significant outperformance of us oil production compared to the eia s eia s current energy outlook steo suggests total us oil production growth of bpd from july to august with nationwide oil production averaging million bpd in august
according to the eia bpd of this growth should come from alaska whereas the predicted decline in production from the gulf of mexico nearly offsets the projected increase from the lower states excluding the gulf of actual well production data and daily throughout figures from the taps pipeline suggests that this projection for alaska is in fact too optimistic with august oil production averaging bpd about bpd below the eia s expectations
nevertheless preliminary production data for the us gulf of mexico suggest further growth potential of bpd in august starkly contrasting the steo s projected decline of bpd
the growth is largely driven by anadarko and hess which exhibit a combined jump in operated oil production of bpd in august amid completion of temporary field maintenance as very limited volumes come from new the most impressive addition is set to arrive from the lower states excluding the gulf of most recent data shows that wells and leases with complete reporting through august generated collective additions of bpd from july to august
the permian midland the of the permian delaware and the eagle ford contribute and bpd additions it should be noted that the remaining volumes which have not yet been reported normally contribute positively to the final addition because the most recent month is the one that is most exposed to the reporting delay says artem abramov head of shale research at rystad energy
essentially this makes us more confident that texas added between and bpd in august in the most conservative click to enlarge outside of texas we calculate a bpd addition from north dakota which has already been confirmed by north dakota industrial commission ndic
both colorado and new mexico oil production climbed significantly in august with growth of and bpd respectively in a conservative case
in colorado we are finally observing a delayed impact on production from strong fracking activity seen in the first half of amid resolution of gas processing bottlenecks
in addition wyoming has displayed capacity to achieve additions of bpd in august with growth driven primarily by a major round of completions by eog eia market tightens as outages from iran venezuela pile up the market should be prepared for the potential high case scenario when eia s monthly data is published
in this scenario lower excluding gom adds bpd in august
this might push us oil output to million bpd abramov says
downside risk exists but we doubt that growth below bpd is realistic and even that is higher than the eia s oil production potential from the us remains dramatic as long as oil prices stay above per barrel
even in a scenario of per barrel we see us oil output growing to million bpd by
moving to a price environment of per barrel would unlock an additional million bpd of volumes in but it also results in faster acceleration of base decline and earlier plateau in the shale industry is still in the middle of a investment cycle says per magnus nysveen senior partner and head of analysis at rystad energy
if a favorable price environment persists we will see the us oil adding the equivalent of one saudi arabia over the next years and with healthy profits seen as soon as the early click to enlarge by rystad energymore top reads from
