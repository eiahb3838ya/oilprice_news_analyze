oil inventories climb as crude prices fall back
in the past month benchmark crude prices fell significantly while domestic storage levels posted the largest series of builds so far this year
lower prices and higher inventories represented trend reversals highlighting the importance of constantly reassessing the state of affairs in the crude supply chain
in this blog we will discuss several factors that contributed to the recent turn of events as well as which components will be particularly important going and inventories lose ground after largely recovering from oversupplynymex light sweet crude wti front month prices plummeted nearly to between october and october falling from the highest daily close since november
prices closed at on october remaining relatively low
before the precipitous drop wti prices strengthened to between august and october
several factors spurred lower prices in recent weeks including storage builds refinery maintenance and production growth in the and total crude inventories excluding the strategic petroleum reserve rose bbls to bbls between weeks ending september and october
the overall build was divided between padds and according to the energy information administration eia

some recent causes of the bearish reversal such as refinery maintenance should have a relatively impact
however certain drivers such as growing production are likely to be in the news headlines for the foreseeable maintenance hinders demand in the is in the midst of the strongest refinery maintenance season in years
the magnitude of unit turnaround was likely caused by two factors
first refineries typically operate on a turnaround schedule and several facilities schedules happened to coincide this year
additionally multiple refiners opted to defer fall maintenance last year to take advantage of strong margins in the wake of hurricane harvey which bumped projects to

this was the first time levels dipped that low since april
utilization rebounded to percent for week ending october after slipping to a low of percent during week ending october processing utilization in the dipped to the lowest level since april in october source genscape

genscape expects unit restarts to continue in the coming weeks potentially reversing the recent trend of inventory builds
however primary processing utilization is not expected to return to the percent level last observed in until contracts reach widest contango structure since november the wti month contract spread switched into a contango structure in for the first time since may
the front month contract closed at a discount to the second month contract on october the widest close since november
the spread remained in a contango structure as of october with front month closing lower than second contango structure signifies that the front month contract price is lower than future month prices
if the spread is wide enough to cover the cost of storage it opens an opportunity for market participants to buy barrels store them for an extended amount of time then sell them for a profit
this phenomenon typically leads to high storage levels especially at cushing which serves as the original delivery point for wti stocks climbed in october while the wti contract spread switched into a contacgo structure sources genscape cme group

during that time genscape s cushing crude oil storage report revealed that cushing hit a utilization rate of percent in may largely due to a persistent contango structure
if the current contango structure persists or widens it could lead to continued storage builds in basin drives domestic production growthwhile refinery maintenance is expected to conclude relatively soon and the future of contract spreads is unclear domestic supply growth seems imminent
crude production volumes averaged about bpd in september reaching a record level after increasing nearly bpd from two years prior
the recent increase pushed the to the top supplier globally ahead of saudi arabia and expects crude production to increase another bpd to more than bpd by september
ongoing domestic supply growth further contributed to recent stock builds and price flows in the west texas permian basin increased nearly bpd to more than bpd in the past two years accounting for the majority of total growth
genscape anticipates that this trend will continue forecasting volumes to increase another bpd by september outpacing many organization of petroleum exporting countries opec permian production met takeaway capacity constraints in source genscape

west texas crude inventories climbed bbls to bbls between weeks ending june and october accounting for percent of the total padd build since september according to genscape s west texas crude storage report
related oil prices buoyed by draws in gasoline distillate inventoriesseveral projects are in the works to increase pipeline capacity out of west texas
the most immediate relief will come from the plains all american sunrise expansion which will provide incremental capacity of bpd from midland tx to wichita falls tx allowing for higher flows to the
line fill is expected to be completed by october with commercial operations beginning november which is earlier than the original estimate according to an august ferc from genscape and other news outlets in september and october highlighted the upcoming sunrise expansion and potential increase in supply to the cushing market contributing to lower wti prices and a narrower differential for wti in midland
as sunrise and other pipeline projects expand west texas takeaway capacity incremental barrels from the permian will gain more access to downstream markets
from there the impact on prices will depend on whether domestic production growth is met by sufficient demand from refineries and exports to international balance faces several uncertaintiesreports of production growth on the international stage also contributed to lower crude prices in october
saudi arabia stated on october that it would be ready to meet any demand that materializes foreshadowing supply increases from the largest producer in opec
meanwhile iraq reported that it reached production volumes in late october and that it has plans to further increase increased production from saudi arabia and iraq is likely to coincide with decreased output from other countries
sanctions on iranian crude exports commence on november which will likely result in lower production from the opec country
however the depth of the expected cuts remains ambiguous
some consumers of iranian crude could continue importing barrels from the country despite the risk of sanctions according to market is also significant downside risk for production in other countries
the economic crisis in venezuela has had considerable ramifications on the country s oil industry
venezuelan production is forecast to fall below bpd by the end of despite exceeding bpd in early according to genscape s global oil supply report
supply disruptions from other countries such as libya and nigeria are also plausible as continual unrest makes production flows unpredictable
to help illuminate changes to production in these countries genscape recently combined its proprietary flare signature evaluation methodology with liquids production data in libya and venezuela to create its oil production monitor which is a estimate of total oil and other liquids on the supply side come amid reports of economic weakness and lowered projections of global consumer demand
the dow jones industrial average the leading indicator for stock markets fell considerably in october from near october to close at on october down percent during the month
stock indices are considered to be a leading indicator of economic health and the market correction in the dow in recent weeks stoked concerns of slowing global economic
real gross domestic product gdp increased at an annual rate of percent in which was a slowdown from percent in according to an october bureau of economic analysis report
also this month opec and the international energy agency iea both cut their forecasts for oil demand growth through
widespread economic concerns pose considerable risk on the demand side of the global oil balance further suppressing crude prices in late so many variables in flux the december opec meeting is shaping up to be a pivotal milestone for oil prices
additional insight on opec countries interpretation of decreased supply from iran and forecasts of weaker demand growth will inform markets as to what to expect on the supply side in the coming multitude of variables affecting crude markets present an uncertain story for how the balance will progress through the end of the year
strong refinery maintenance the contango contract structure production growth in the and abroad and forecasts of global demand all paint a bearish picture
prices weakened accordingly in the past month
however significant risk for international supply disruptions especially in countries such as iran and venezuela provides strong upside potential for factors to pay attention to in the coming months are inventories through the end of refinery turnaround the structure of the wti forward curve and subsequent storage activity in cushing permian production growth and takeaway capacity additions iranian output in the wake of sanctions and the supply discussion from other opec countries particularly at the next meeting on december genscapemore top reads from
