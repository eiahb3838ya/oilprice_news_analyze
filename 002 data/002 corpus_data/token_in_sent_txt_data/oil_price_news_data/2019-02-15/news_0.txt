worldâ€™s largest offshore oil field partially shut down
the safaniyah oil field in saudi world s producing at a reduced capacity after a ship s anchor cut a main power cable reuters reports citing a knowledgeable source
an earlier report from marketwatch quoted information from energy intelligence suggesting production at the filed had completely stopped sparking worry about global heavy oil worry was justified with venezuela sliding more deeply into chaos and with new sanctions reducing the flow of venezuelan heavy crude to refineries another heavy field outage is exactly what the market does not has a production capacity of over million barrels of heavy crude reason enough for the market to get excited or worried or both
however now that there is more information about the possible cause of the outage and its extent this excitement or worry might calm or without a field outage however saudi arabia has once again played the star role in helping oil prices recoup some of the losses suffered late last year
the kingdom has been reducing its production by more barrels than it was obliged to leading an almost production decline last arabia plans to reduce its crude oil production further to million bpd in march energy minister khalid said in an interview for the financial times
this compares with more than million bpd produced in november
exports said will also fall substantially over this month and next to an average of million bpd from million bpd in november
in the more immediate term however brent jumped above us a barrel after beginning today s trade with a slide below this level
the credit was due the news of the partial production outage at safaniyah but earlier reports from this week about opec s output cuts also the time of writing however brent crude was trading at us a barrel with wti at us a irina slav for top reads from
