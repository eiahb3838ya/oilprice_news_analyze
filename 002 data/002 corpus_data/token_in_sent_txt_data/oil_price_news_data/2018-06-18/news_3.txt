iran looks to veto saudi, russian oil production proposal
in the latest signal that the upcoming meeting in vienna could end in disaster iran s opec representative said the country will veto any proposal for a production increase with the support of venezuela and arabia and russia will propose an increase in production beginning from july with the range of the suggested increase at between bpd and million bpd
however three opec founders are going to stop it hossein kazempour ardebili told bloomberg adding if the kingdom of saudi arabia and russia want to increase production this requires unanimity
if the two want to act alone that s a breach of the cooperation the warning comes on the heels of an announcement by russia s alexander novak that moscow and riyadh had agreed to make their oil market partnership permanent with a clause in their bilateral agreement stipulating that they could intervene to raise or lower production as they see it is easier for saudi arabia and russia to start pumping more since they are now producing below capacity
venezuela however is already struggling with an inexorable decline in its oil production which to a significant extent drove the overcompliance of the bloc with the agreed production cuts
related venezuela forced to shut down production as operations fall apartiran will also find it difficult to increase production especially in the face of renewed sanctions
iraq for its part is eager to expand its production capacity but it will take time to do right now these three opec members are at a clear disadvantage to those capable of quickly restoring production levels
since any decision by opec needs to be unanimous and the chances of that happening are slim what we are increasingly likely to see on friday is what ardebili referred to as a breach of the cooperation by irina slav for top reads from
