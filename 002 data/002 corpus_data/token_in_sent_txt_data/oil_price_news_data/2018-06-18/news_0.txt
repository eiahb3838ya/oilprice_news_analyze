where will u.s. frackers drill next?
with wti oil prices staying above a barrel for several months drillers are breaking production records each week mostly thanks to the permian in west texas and new recent months however some companies have started to test their fracking capabilities on oil fields that most agree reached their peak production decades believe that it s a winning bet
analysts say it could be a breakthrough for the more challenging chalk formations in east texas and louisiana
authorities and industry officials in louisiana believe there s a resurgence in one of the old areas in the state and want to support investment in the austin chalk which stretches from texas to the gulf of mexico and cuts through much of central louisiana is one of those formations that was hot back in the but has been forgotten since then especially after hydraulic fracturing shifted the industry attention to other areas in the united bakken in the north and the eagle ford and the permian in have started to drill frac wells in the austin chalk where the number of drilling rigs has doubled over the past six months to and oil production surged to bpd last year from just bpd five years austin chalk play is going through a resurgence in activity and new horizontal drilling and completion techniques have resulted in substantial production rates according to the state of louisiana s department of natural resources
the eastern portion of the austin chalk play has unexplored and underexplored areas with significant open acreage available the department said in march this the majority of the production has occurred in the western half of the state while new permitting and leasing activity is concentrated in the central and eastern portions of the play in rapides avoyelles and pointe coupee oil corporation for example bought a largely contiguous position in the emerging louisiana austin chalk play last year at a cost of less than per acre
related possible outcomes from the opec meeting critical to our value creation and returns we captured future potential opportunities through exploration acreage additions including a material position in the emerging louisiana austin chalk play marathon oil president and ceo lee tillman said at the results announced in april its entry into the central louisiana austin what we were seeing with some of the newer technologies work really well in the austin chalk conocophillips ceo ryan lance told resource development corporation brought four austin chalk wells online in the first quarter of resources also has a new horizontal production well in the eastern part of the austin austin chalk fracking has yielded some success in texas but it hasn t been extensively tested in louisiana according to wood eog is trying drilling the eagles ranch the first modern completion in this portion of the austin chalk
early results suggest it could be a breakthrough for louisiana acreage the analysts said last while natural fracturing has generated impressive initial production rates in texas the louisiana landscape is more complex
economic wells will require a complex interplay of natural fractures and matrix production in just the right balance
the rock is challenging so completions will need to be aggressive and costs will be high says s eagles ranch well will likely be the benchmark for subsequent tests this year the analysts us million including expenses for scientific testing the well suggests future well costs between us and us million
however decline rates have been steep in the first three months the analysts note
related the unlikely solution to the battery bottleneck we expect to be a pivotal year in the ongoing evolution of austin chalk exploration particularly in louisiana
it will be somewhat though but if wti prices stay above us per barrel exploration activity will no doubt continue to build woodmac companies test the geology and rates of old fields drilled with new technology louisiana hopes that the austin chalk resurgence could revive its anytime you mention the austin chalk the committee room lights up the chairman of the house natural resources and environmental committee state representative stuart bishop of lafayette said in an april article by gifford briggs president of the louisiana oil gas association loga my community was brought to their knees in the recent oil down turn and the uptick in texas activity has many of our families heading to work in the permian
the austin chalk will bring much needed relief and opportunity for my constituents
i would rather send our workforce somewhere in louisiana than anywhere in texas bishop tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
