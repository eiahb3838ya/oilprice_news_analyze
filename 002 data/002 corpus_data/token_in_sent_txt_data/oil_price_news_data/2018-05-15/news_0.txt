these two shale plays are making a comeback
the permian basin has garnered much of the media attention when it comes to shale growth but higher oil prices are putting more shale regions into profitable years past shale companies trumpeted their diversified holdings noting their foothold in multiple shale basins in disparate parts of the that started to change when oil prices cratered to as low as per barrel
during the depths of the oil market downturn shale production dipped but quickly rebounded aided by soaring output from the permian
while places like the bakken and eagle ford struggled with oil prices below per barrel drillers could still make it work in the permian
shale companies large and small began shedding assets in undesirable locations in order to focus on the with wti consolidating gains at per barrel and looking to move higher some of those castoff drilling locales are now back in the money
since the beginning of the rig count in the permian has skyrocketed by nearly percent to as of may
even as the number of rigs in west texas has soared there have been smaller but a uptick in the number of rigs in other locations particularly in the last few months as oil prices surged to highs
related opec the oil glut is gonethe williston basin which includes the bakken saw its rig count hit a recent low point at at the start of this year but the region has added rigs since then
the eagle ford also saw the number of rigs dwindle over the course of before rebounding in february adding rigs in the past three months

the bakken was thought to have peaked at at the end of but it is now close to surpassing that high point production in the bakken is expected to rise to next month after bottoming out at in december best days for the eagle ford were also thought to be in the past hitting in and declining since then
however after bottoming out at in august the south texas shale field has rebounded to
click to enlarge places like the bakken and eagle ford are generally not as profitable as the permian
the permian has multiple layers of shale stacked together allowing drillers to access much more oil and gas than in other places
that ultimately means that the breakeven cost for producing in other shale regions is higher than it might be in the permian
related skeptic geologist warns permian s best years are behind usbut the rebound in the bakken and eagle ford among other shale regions is not just the result of higher oil prices although that is a major part of it
shale regions across the country are also benefitting from the bottlenecks that have struck the permian
the constraint on fracking crews labor and other drilling services are pushing up costs
the concentration of activity has also pushed land prices through the importantly pipelines are filled to the brim which is leading to discounts for oil in midland that recently surpassed per barrel
that is leading to a unique situation in which some less fortunate companies are having trouble moving their product while others continue to ramp up
we expect the market could witness the development of haves and in the broader permian basin for takeaway and basis risk management and believe this is a significant looming differentiator anadarko s ceo robert walker said on an earnings call in early may
in other words shrewd drillers locked up available pipeline space to carry their oil to the gulf coast while those companies that have failed to secure pipeline capacity could suffer serious discounts for their companies are going to have to diversify into other shale basins
just as in the recent past e ps tried to sell their pure play exposure to the permian now more drillers are once again talking up their diversified holdings
with the permian already very crowded capital and rigs will spill over into other last year it was all about how much can you put in the permian daniel romero an analyst with the wood mackenzie told the wall street journal
but now a few months later it s what else are you doing outside of the permian by nick cunningham of top reads from
