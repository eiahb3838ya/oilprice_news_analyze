energy experts are watching this hotspot in 2019
historically the mediterranean hasn t been the focus of oil and gas producing companies
with the exception of algeria and libya which owe their energy industry to the sahara region
recent discoveries however have put the eastern mediterranean in the spotlight
in the case of cyprus the unresolved division of the island and overlapping claims with turkey have created an extra layer of complexity when it comes to attracting international energy companies
despite close political relations between qatar and turkey qatar petroleum has joined exxonmobil in a joint venture concerning gas exploration in the eez of cyprus
ankara however has remained strikingly silent on doha s potential of the eastern mediterraneanover the years major natural gas discoveries in the eastern mediterranean have turned the fortunes of the littoral states
especially israel stands to benefit as almost all of its energy needs are met by foreign producers such as russia and azerbaijan
the recently discovered gas fields in its eez are sufficient to meet the country s needs while at the same time surplus gas is exported
egypt on the other hand became a net importer of lng in due to rising consumption and a slump in domestic production
the discovery of the massive zohr gas field has significantly changed cairo s energy outlook
egypt is slated to become a regional gas february eni announced the discovery of the calypso gas field in cyprus eez which confirms the extension of the zohr like play
this find was especially significant for nicosia as it makes it more likely that cypriot gas can be developed on its own
previous discoveries such as aphrodite are regarded too small which needed to be aggregated with gas in order to become profitable
cyprus difficult relations with turkey and the northern turkish inhabitants of the island are a serious impediment for the quick development of the gas playing hardball while most of the littoral states have announced multiple discoveries turkey is missing out
ankara has put pressure on gas exploration in cypriot waters due to two reasons first it maintains that also the turkish inhabitants of the island should benefit from gas production
second the turks claim certain parts of cyprus eez due to the apparent extension of the continental shelf
for this reason turkish naval vessels blocked an exploration ship leased by eni in february in block
related could make or break opec click to enlarge exxon and qatar petroleum have joined forces in exploratory work in block
in a statement the turkish government has said exxonmobil s gas exploration in the block licensed by south cyprus does not contribute to the stability of the country or the region and may change specific and delicate balances in relation to resolving the cyprus issue
washington however has warned turkey on several occasions not to obstruct nicosia in its legitimate actions
assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs wess mitchell said turkey view on the gas exploration and drilling efforts of cyprus is a minority one and the united states would not take a friendly view in any harassment in cypriot waters especially those involving vessels
related why goldman just drastically slashed its oil price predictiondespite turkey s fierce rhetoric aimed at international energy companies qatar petroleum has escaped ankara s ire due to three reasons first exxonmobil is the lead operator while qatar petroleum is a junior partner
second the exploratory ships are exxon which doha does have much say over
lastly and most importantly drilling is taking place in one of the few areas which are claimed by turkey opposition to qatar participation is expressed behind closed doors
as long as doha doesn t extend its cooperation in areas which are more difficult to ignore by ankara the turks will be able to overlook qatar petroleum cooperation with exxon
furthermore turkey is also aware that it should erode doha sovereignty
the close cooperation between the countries is caused by the saudi led bloc blockade of qatar and its attacks on the tiny country sovereignty
therefore for now ankara will remain opposed to gas production in cypriot waters while avoiding confrontation with qatar over its economic interests
