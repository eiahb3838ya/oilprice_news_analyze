who are the biggest winners in the east-med gas game?
the eastmed gas pipeline between cyprus greece and israel will revolutionise the economies and of the region
the project comes from an emerging alliance between the three countries who must move forward cautiously in the face of neighbouring states mediterranean the bigger pictureon december the prime ministers of cyprus greece and israel converged on the southern israeli city of beersheba
all three parties publicly committed to signing a agreement in the near future
such an agreement would solidify one of the longest and deepest underwater gas pipeline in the is expected to deliver approximately billion cubic meters bcm of natural gas to the european union eu through greece and italy
the eu is keen to support the project and diversify its natural gas imports away from the heavily sanctioned russian federation and declining north sea gas production
the eastmed project would fulfil roughly the eu s projected natural gas needs
the united states is also supporting the project as it sees the growing trilateral alliance as a bulwark of democracy and stability in a largely authoritarian and new regional alliancethis development is also the culmination of an alliance that has been years in the making
the last decade has seen growing cooperation between cyprus greece and israel as all three countries have been supporting one another in various strategic areas
this includes deepening military ties in the face of an increasingly unstable and conflict prone eastern mediterranean
these developments are specifically aimed at turkey a neighboring state that has become increasingly aggressive and authoritarian
turkey is threatening to derail the project within the context of ongoing cypriot conflict
related canada s natural gas crisis is being ignoredthe project will be the culmination of a strategic alliance between three smaller countries who are faced with increasingly more aggressive competitors and crisis s in the region
turkey russia and iran are all increasingly active in the region looking to forward their own interests
as the united states continues to play less of a role on the ground cyprus greece and israel will be able to create positive reinforcement through bilateral relations or the newly created secretariat economically politically and stands to benefit the domestic economies of the individual states within the trilateral alliance stand to benefit immensely from the project
cyprus is estimated to have roughly bcm of natural gas in the aphrodite field which is currently being developed within its exclusive economic zone eez a huge sum
israel is estimated to have significantly larger amounts within its eez in the form of the leviathan and tamar fields
both of these small countries will benefit immensely from being able to export to the massive eu market through greece
the latter s own economy will likely see a boost from the investment needed to support the infrastructure of the pipeline
there is also the possibility of linking the pipeline to the operational egyptian zohr eu will benefit from being able to diversify its energy sources
it would allow the eu to guarantee some energy security to its member states as north sea production falls
an over reliance on russian natural gas also places the eu in a difficult position because it continues sanctioning russia over its activities in ukraine and the meddling in the democratic processes of eu member states
the eu will likely try to lower market prices on natural gas which have been steadily rising the last few years
in the long run the eastmed pipeline may provide nearly double the expected output of bcm for export if ongoing offshore exploration provides positive is missing out turkey and russia are both set to lose out given current developments
greece and turkey have a historically difficult relationship which has recently flared up within the context of the coup and refugee crisis
cyprus and turkey continue to butt headsover the northern half of the island following the war
israel and turkey were once close allies
the rise of erdogan and the ak party over a decade ago made turkey a major patron of hamas
the mavi marmara incident has contributed to the deterioration in ties between the two sides
turkey would have been the natural route for the pipeline but the ongoing disputes show why this will never happen
related has fracking activity peaked already russia is the main supplier of natural gas to the eu and a historical ally of greece
if the eu is able to continue to diversify its energy needs away from the russian gas giants of which the eastmed is a small but important first step russia will lose leverage over the eu within the context of both gas prices and geopolitical issues between the two sides
the historically close relationship between russia and greece is also in jeopardy
the pipeline project is heavily supported by the united states when we couple this with russia and turkey s warming ties russia appears to be losing a historically important relationship in an increasingly strategic obstaclestwo major obstacles to the project are present in the form of the lebanese based hezbollah and turkey
hezbollah is israel s the two sides fought an war in a conflict neither side wishes to repeat
this is something hezbollah is attempting to use for its own advantage threatening to strike at israel s gas fields
israel is preparing for this outcome but hezbollah s missile arsenal is vast and powerful any escalation in conflict especially given the ongoing operation northern shield may lead to disruptions in the erdogan has made it very clear that he is vehemently against any development of the cypriot gas fields within the eez without some form of resolution to the conflict
this has materialized with turkish naval action in the past and with the beginning of own explorations in the eez
turkey has used military force in the past and ongoing developments in the region the us withdrawal from syria following a phone call with erdogan has emboldened turkey
aggressive action by turkey to safeguard its own interests can not be global risk insightsmore top reads from
