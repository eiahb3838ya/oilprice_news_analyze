libya aims to double oil production within 2 years
libya plans to pump million bpd of crude oil by if the security situation improves the chairman of the national oil corporation mustafa sanalla said as quoted by reuters this ambitious plan would represent a doubling of the current rate of production in the north african country according to sanalla libya s output currently stands at bpd
that s less than what the country produced earlier this year prior to the latest blockade of the largest field sharara which removed more than bpd from the total daily average
however it s more than what libya pumped in the summer when violent clashes at its oil terminals crushed oil production by almost half from the million bpd earlier in the on which noc declared force majeure in has yet to resume production when the security conditions for workers improve sanalla said adding that incidents such as the blockade by tribesmen and members of the petroleum facilities guard demanding payments to lift the blockade are discouraging foreign companies from returning to libya and helping it to expand its oil sanalla said bp will be returning to the country and so will russian companies which he declined to name
last october bp s chief executive bob dudley told reuters that bp and eni will begin exploratory drilling in libya in the first quarter of next year
bp has percent in an offshore oil and gas block in the north african country and earlier this year the italian major struck a deal with bp to buy half of it
i m not sure about this year since it takes time to set up offshore rigs but for sure dudley said at the companies might also join bp and the russians in libya according to sanalla
he announced at a news conference that he would visit china by the end of march this year to discuss investment opportunities
