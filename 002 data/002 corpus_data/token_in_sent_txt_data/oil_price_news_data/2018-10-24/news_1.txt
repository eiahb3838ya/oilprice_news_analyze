why u.s. shale may fall short of expectations
the shale industry may not grow as much or at least as fast as everyone thinks it will according to a top industry drilling frenzy in west texas is not only facing pipeline constraints an issue that is very at this point but also some operational problems
schlumberger s ceo paal kibsgaard says that the shale industry is running into some productivity issues that might mean that shale growth ends up undershooting many of the heady growth t the market consensus that the permian can continue to provide million barrels per day of annual production growth for the foreseeable future is starting to be called into question kibsgaard said in an earnings call with analysts
pipeline woes are indeed causing a slowdown in the permian but this isn t the only problem
instead we believe the main challenge in the permian going forward is more likely to be reservoir and well performance as the rate of infield drilling continues to accelerate kibsgaard issue is the density and proximity of the zillions of shale wells drilled in places like the eagle ford and the permian
in recent years the industry increased the density of shale wells stacking them closer and closer together
one well pad could host a greater number of wells
companies also drilled longer laterals used more sand and more water and the improved returns seemed more recently this intensification is bumping up against their limits
in the eagle ford there is evidence to suggest that packing too many wells too close together actually reduces productivity as wells interfere with each other
it s a problem known as well interference or interference as each additional well shooting off from a main parent well adds productivity but only up to a certain limit
beyond that threshold additional wells start to reduce productivity
related oil steady despite major crude buildan august report from rystad energy found that the shale industry even started to increase spacing between wells in the eagle ford evidence that drillers have already realized the problems with crowding wells too close together
in the eagle ford the percentage of wells drilled less than feet away from each other steadily increased from through
since then these wells saw their share of the market drop
in other words since the practice of packing wells close together started to fade a bit in the eagle those problems are showing up in the permian
in the permian the percentage of child wells in the midland wolfcamp basin has just reached and we are already starting to see a similar reduction in unit well productivity to that already seen in the eagle ford suggesting that the permian growth potential could be lower than earlier expected kibsgaard also warned that a lot of operators are pushing some of their projects too hard in an effort to squeeze out profits
that helped drive efficiencies in recent years but those efforts are now running up against a wall
since many of the international operators have focused on maximizing cash flow by producing their fields harder and by prioritizing actions at the expense of the required full cycle investments kibsgaard told analysts
this investment focus offers a finite set of opportunities over a limited period of time and this period is now clearly coming to an end as seen by accelerating decline rates in many countries around the related the quiet swing producers iraq libya nigeriaan acceleration in decline rates becomes an even greater problem after taking into account the supply gap that might emerge in the coming years
after the oil market downturn in the industry slashed spending and cancelled projects
several years on from those decisions the effect on the market is just starting to come into focus
r educed production tailwind from new projects that were sanctioned and largely funded prior to are now uncovering the underlying weakness in the international production base kibsgaard taking into account the sharp losses in venezuela and iran it is clear that the oil market could be in for some supply trouble he argues
i our view after years of low activity the international production base now needs significant growth in investments for the foreseeable future simply to maintain production flat at current levels kibsgaard operational problems in the shale patch should raise some alarm for oil forecasters who are counting on aggressive growth from texas
kibsgaard who heads the world s largest oilfield services company in the world is essentially saying that shale may not come to the rescue in the years nick cunningham of top reads from
