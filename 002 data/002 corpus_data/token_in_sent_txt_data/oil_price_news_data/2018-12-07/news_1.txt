the real implications of the new permian estimates
this week the united states geological survey usgs announced a groundbreaking oil and gas discovery in west texas permian basin
according to the organization s recent press release a whopping billion barrels of oil trillion cubic feet of natural gas and billion barrels of natural gas liquids are now believed to lie untapped in the wolfcamp shale and overlying bone spring formation area of texas and new mexico s permian players in the energy industry already have a significant presence in wolfcamp and bone spring including occidental petroleum and pioneer natural resources co
it was already well known and well documented that these fields were remarkably fertile grounds for oil extraction but the extent of the new figures released this week by the usgs has made the massive crude and shale reserves of the permian basin freshly
the figures in this week s press release are in fact in the case of wolfcamp shale more than double the previous resource assessment
click to enlarge source usgsthe usgs assessed the area more than two years ago in and has officially determined that it contained the largest estimated quantity of continuous oil in the entire united states
christmas came a few weeks early this year said secretary of the interior ryan zinke in response to these momentous figures
american strength flows from american energy and as it turns out we have a lot of american energy
before this assessment came down i was bullish on oil and gas production in the united states
now i know for a fact that american energy dominance is within our grasp as a nation
related is this the next big petrochemical hub in the the usgs qualifies the figures of their massive discovery as consisting of undiscovered technically recoverable resources which they define as those resources that are estimated to exist based on geologic knowledge and already established production while technically recoverable resources are those that can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices
whether or not it is profitable to produce these resources has not been evaluated
the continued productivity and massive untapped resources present in the permian basin are particularly vital to the united states energy industry in a time that most shale wells are in steep decline after years of record booms and cheap markets
now in addition to this stunning discovery from the usgs there is even further hope that there are still additional technically recoverable resources lying in wait yet to be
jim reilly the director of usgs a facet of the department of interior highlighted how remarkable the discovery was in the larger context of the industry
in the s during my time in the petroleum industry the permian and similar mature basins were not considered viable for producing large new recoverable resources
today thanks to advances in technology the permian basin continues to impress in terms of resource potential
the results of this most recent assessment and that of the wolfcamp formation in the midland basin in are our largest continuous oil and gas assessments ever reilly stressed knowing where these resources are located and how much exists is crucial to ensuring both our energy independence and energy additionally these discoveries come at a particularly opportune time for west texas as a major injection of funding has just been provided toward infrastructure the west texas area via a federal grant supported by
senator john cornyn
the grant which comes from a program led by the department of transportation better utilizing investments to leverage development
will direct money to infrastructure projects in winkler glasscock and reagan recent discovery and continued investment in the permian basin shows that the industry continues to be bullish in west texas and with good reason despite the volatility of the oil industry as a whole
while other major fields continue to decline in production the permian basin has managed to stay above the fray and certainly shows no sign of haley zaremba for top reads from
