opec+ succeeds, what’s next for oil?
oil prices spiked on friday on news from managed to pull off an agreement checking all the boxes after a contentious set of meetings
there were a lot of competing interests at play but the agreement offers a little bit of everything enough for all parties to walk away headliner is the cut beginning in january with a review scheduled for april
opec will shoulder bpd of the total and countries will take on the other bpd
the baseline used to measure the cuts is october production cut is larger than some analysts had expected especially given the rumors swirling on thursday about a cut of around
in fact one could argue that the group cleverly managed market expectations lowering them on thursday only to surprise the market with a larger cut on friday
prior to the meeting might have been considered a cut but after the seemingly tumultuous set of meetings on thursday and early friday a cut ends up looking like a highly successful had held up the talks early friday
saudi arabia pushed for them to agree to a symbolic cut an odd position given that iran s output at this point is far below capacity and far below its prior ceiling
iran with good reason argued that it should not have to sign on to any cuts especially since sanctions are likely going to curtail output even further in the months rumors on friday were that the holdup could sink a deal but that was never going to be the case
it s extremely hard to imagine saudi arabia walking away from a deal that included meaningful cuts from other producers just because iran wouldn t symbolically cut their output

all countries appear to be participants in the deal but there won t be quotas
iran did not receive an official exemption some opec officials argued even as the iranians claimed they did
other officials said that there would be special this point is a matter of splitting hairs iran s production is likely to fall in the coming months it doesn t really matter what they call it
that s also why this issue was not going to be the thing that sunk the entire prices spiked on the news with brent up around percent immediately after the agreement was as expected played a pivotal role in the deal and its willingness to go along with a cut was the key factor in the reduction although russia s precise contribution was not known at the time of this writing deal can be called a success for two reasons
first it takes off of the market beginning in january which will go a long way to erasing the surplus
second it removes a great deal of uncertainty about what to expect in the near future
oil prices have been all over the map in the last few months with saudi production surging at a time when shale was also defying expectations
now it s reasonable to assume that any surplus or deficit won t be so large as to lead to dramatic price swings at least in the short run

president trump has repeatedly demanded low oil prices and tweeted as recently as wednesday to that effect
typically opec would not be all that sensitive to trump s demands but saudi arabia is reeling after the international outrage over the murder of jamal khashoggi
a bipartisan movement in washington is upping the pressure on riyadh and trump has been one of the few friends saudi arabia has oil prices rise too much trump might lash out and dump the saudis although what that means in practice is very much unclear
due to extreme budgetary pressure from low oil prices saudi arabia had no choice but to risk trump s ire and push for meaningfully supply now is likely patting themselves on the back
they reached an agreement that is mostly acceptable to everyone oil prices are up the surplus will narrow significantly and uncertainty is greatly the agreement calls for a review in april
the timing is not coincidental waivers granted to eight countries importing iranian oil expire in may
by april everyone will know much more about what direction washington intends to go in and how much oil iran will lose
if iranian exports are rapidly falling to zero would have time to unwind the production nick cunningham of top reads from
