the biggest threat to oil market stability
the oil market should be mostly balanced this year although policy risk will be a much larger driver for oil prices than the underlying fundamentals according to a new report from standard crude started the year off repairing the damage from the epic meltdown in the fourth quarter but over the last few weeks oil prices have rebounded
standard chartered sees brent rising much farther averaging as high as per barrel this year before averaging as high as per barrel in this forecast hinges on a variety of key policy decisions
first must keep its production cuts in place and indeed the group needs to cap output at january levels
if they can manage that then global crude inventories would only rise by a minor million barrels per day according to standard would set the stage for a better situation for next year
with growth expected to be limited outside north america and oil supply expected to slow markedly we think opec will be able to raise output by million barrels per day in without unbalancing the market emily ashford and paul horsnell wrote in a standard chartered reportalthough the fundamentals appear to be benign in the face of market management additional policy risk could have an outsized impact on chartered singled out the government as a major source of volatility
if the balances were the sole driver of opec output policy the stage would have been set for a relatively quiet year the investment bank wrote
however there is a disruptive factor in the market which is likely to complicate policy choices policy has become harder to related south africa oil discovery could be a a quiet first year from president trump was markedly different
tweets on oil expressing a strong desire for lower prices significant developments in policy towards iran and venezuela and a sense that domestic energy policy is in a period of substantial flux standard chartered wrote
we think that the oil market oil producers and oil analysts have yet to adapt fully to the uncertainty and policy risks injected into the oil market by the trump there is very little clarity on how much oil will be lost in venezuela and iran for instance and the white house has a great deal of influence over these issues
as of now the is squeezing venezuela as hard as it can effectively barring both the import of venezuelan oil and the export of diluents to the country
that puts much of venezuela s oil production at of idling tankers off both the coast of venezuela and in the gulf coast attest to the disruption that is already underway
to be sure the new york times reported that russia is sending some fuel shipments to venezuela to help pdvsa process its heavy crude which could help prevent catastrophic losses
however the declines are expected to continue
the question is by how much as for iran the has clearly expressed its desire to take a harder line
by all accounts the government plans on issuing no new waivers for sanctions with the stated goal of getting iran s oil exports to zero
at around currently achieving that goal would amount be a major loss of problem is that trump s goal of regime change in venezuela conflicts with its iran policy
simply put it is going to be tough to shut in output in both countries without sending crude oil prices significantly higher
if anything is certain when it comes to trump s whims and desires it is that he wants low gasoline prices
it s not clear how he achieves that while simultaneously encircling and shutting down the oil industries in both venezuela and iran

the trade war may be on hold but the deadline for a deal is only a few weeks away
a ratcheting up of tensions could kneecap the global economy and it s a decision that is entirely up to isn t just trump however
another layer of uncertainty will come from the implementation of regulations on marine fuels by the international maritime organization imo
the sulfur concentration in marine fuels will have to drop from percent to just percent by january which could cause some upheaval in refined fuel markets
indeed the margins for gasoline and diesel have already diverged a rather long list of major policy decisions and endeavors that complicate any pricing forecast and in fact they question the very utility of trying to predict oil prices in this standard chartered noted if we simply extrapolate forward cuts we can come to the conclusion that inventories would be mostly balanced resulting in a quiet year for even as commands enormous influence over crude prices the oil market is at the mercy of a handful of policy decisions many of which will be made by the nick cunningham of top reads from
