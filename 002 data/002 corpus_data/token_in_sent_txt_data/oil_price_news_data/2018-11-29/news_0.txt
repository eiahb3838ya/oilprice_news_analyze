the biggest winners of the oil price slump
brent crude has sunk to us a barrel with wti down to us and not surprisingly talk about brent hitting us a barrel by the end of the year is suddenly scarce
importers are breathing a sigh of relief no doubt and exporters are probably beginning to worry the news about lower oil prices is good
it s good for the emerging markets as a bloomberg review of the situation showed and as common sense would suggest
every us drop in the price of oil translates into a of gdp increase in income in the biggest oil importers an estimate by capital economics cited by bloomberg economic growth in these same emerging markets slowed down this year prompting a number of forecasters to revise down their oil demand projections
lower oil prices would probably spur more demand especially if the dollar weakens as right now the strong greenback is serving as a deterrent to oil demand demand is good for producers as a general rule but it has to come at the right price and as usual producers of crude and importers of the commodity have different views of what the right price is
indeed that us decline in the price of oil according to capital economics would translate into percent lower gdp in most gulf states and percent lower gdp in the uae russia and this is not the best of news it seems the gulf economies are quite resilient to oil price shocks
capital economics estimated that even if prices went lower to us a barrel and even us some gulf economies including saudi arabia the uae kuwait and qatar would be able to plug their budget deficits from the forex reserves for at least a decade
one interesting point capital economics makes is that the uae could fund its budget deficit indefinitely which certainly sounds pretty bold
related natural gas prices fall below zero in texasthe imf however recently warned that gulf economies remain vulnerable to oil price shocks
the fund acknowledged that in several countries including saudi arabia and the uae higher oil revenues earlier this year had more than offset increases in public spending there is a tangible risk that the commitment to implement key fiscal measures and structural reforms will weaken amid higher oil now that prices have slumped again these economies will get the necessary motivation to continue their diversification efforts so they would be ultimately positive for them as well
and yet many seem to expect this price slump to be and prices to return to levels above us a price information service tom kloza for one told cnbc last week he expected prices to rebound before long as both brent and wti were currently being oversold
oil can be stabilized in december and will be helped by the higher demand as refiners ramp up to over barrels a day of crude use
a cold northern hemisphere winter juices up demand as well the analyst explained
related bp is comfortable with oilwhat s more most analysts seem to expect opec to agree on a production cut of at least million bpd and also most expect russia to agree to join the cut despite its usual guardedness in making any definite announcements before the deadline which this time is december when the cartel will meet in will push prices higher probably prompting another critical tweet from president trump and once again put emerging economies under the twin pressure of expensive oil and costly dollars
but some such as morgan stanley don t see the cut as a certainty
the investment bank estimates the likelihood of a cut agreement at means there is a good chance russia which hasn t been enthusiastic about the idea of new cuts so at current levels
and then that scenario of capital economics with oil at us and even us might materialize
the consequences would be interesting to watch in both emerging economies and oil irina slav for top reads from
