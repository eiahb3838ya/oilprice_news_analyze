does saudi arabia really have as much oil as analysts think?
officially venezuela has the world s largest crude oil reserves with billion barrels of proved reserves
but a lot of this oil is crude oil and may not be economical to produce at prevailing prices
thus some portion of venezuela s barrels may in reality no longer be in the proved reserves that venezuela s proved reserves jumped from billion barrels in to billion barrels in
the main reason for that wasn t a bunch of new oil discoveries
no it was the fact that oil prices had reached triple digits making venezuela s extra heavy oil economical to produce
in other words resources the oil in the ground were moved into the proved reserves oil that is economical to produce arabia on the other hand reported billion barrels of proved reserves in and billion barrels in
saudi arabia s barrels were deemed to be economical to produce even before oil prices spiked
for that reason i consider saudi arabia s proved reserves percent of the global total to be of the most significance to the global oil doubts about the amount of saudi arabia s reserves have persisted for years
in saudi arabia stopped allowing their oil and gas data to be scrutinized
prior to that outsiders had some access to information on their reserves
when that accessibility was shut down saudi proved oil reserves were estimated to be billion around saudi raised their estimate of proved reserves by billion barrels
many pundits have suggested that this upward revision was based on internal opec politics
since the reserves were no longer subject to outside audit there was a great deal of skepticism around the official numbers the saudis skepticism deepened when one considered that saudi s reserves in were billion barrels and today nearly years later they are reportedly billion barrels
meanwhile saudi arabia produced over billion barrels between and
how then could their reserves be essentially unchanged
related is right to dismiss nuclear energy in preparation for a potential ipo saudi s national oil company saudi aramco commissioned an outside audit of its proved reserves
the external audit found saudi s proved oil reserves to be at least billion doubts persist
for example oil economist mamdouh salameh who is a visiting professor of energy economics at escp europe business school london recently wrote my calculation of saudi reserves based on saudi production since the discovery of oil in till now for which we have figures and a deduction of an annual depletion rate of saudi aging fields averaging percent for the same period gives a figure of bb of remaining reserves
my figures are more or less in line with those of other i once did a similar calculation
i started with the assumption that the estimate of billion barrels was correct and then i just subtracted saudi production since then
i calculated their total production since as billion barrels leaving billion barrels of i then did a sanity check that threw that calculation in doubt
i did the same calculation for proved reserves over the same time proved crude oil reserves were reported to be billion barrels
by and before the shale oil boom was underway proved reserves had only fallen to billion barrels
but total production between and was billion we extend that calculation through the end of proved reserves have actually jumped to billion barrels per the bp statistical review and there have been billion barrels of production since reiterate in proved crude oil reserves stood at billion barrels
between then and the produced billion barrels of oil yet proved reserves grew to billion barrels
related can ukraine gain energy independence how did this happen
there were new discoveries technological improvements that allowed more barrels to be extracted from existing fields and higher prices that made additional resources economical to think it s reasonable to assume that saudi arabia also found additional barrels since
they also have access to the same kinds of technology that improved recovery in fields
therefore i do not believe it s a legitimate exercise to consider depletion from a historical reserves number to estimate current reserves
such an exercise would have suggested that oil production would have fallen to zero by i don t find a reasonable basis for concluding that saudi arabia s reserves are much lower than their official numbers
their published reserves are consistent with the independent audit and they are consistent with the experience in the of reserves growth despite significant oil you think that the results are atypical you can repeat this exercise for any of the world s major oil producers and find the same thing
starting with the proved reserves in and subtracting the subsequent production will not accurately predict the reserves at some point in the future
in many cases as with the cumulative production was greater than the proved reserves i have thus far found no good reason to doubt saudi arabia s official robert rapiermore top reads from
