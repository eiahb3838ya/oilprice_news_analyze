bank of america: oil ‘anchored’ until 2024
brent oil prices should trade between a relatively narrow range of to per barrel through with prices anchored around according to a new report from bank of america merrill dovetails with the current futures prices five years out centered around per barrel
prices will bounce around but should remain within that of course there are plenty of caveats with this outlook
a year ago the bank said that the risks to the forecast were skewed to the upside
now it believes that the downside risks are growing
shale supply continues to rise expanding faster and by larger volumes over the past year than anticipated
also demand is slowing and expected to continue to decelerate
in the short run bofaml sees brent rising back to per barrel
the combination of cuts involuntary outages in venezuela and iran declines in mexico and elsewhere will all contribute to tighter supply
and unlike in the reductions this time around are occurring against tighter backdrop of lower inventories and a smaller production surplus which should make the output curtailments more the flip side of the production cuts is that opec is building back up spare capacity
the phase in of the supply curbs at the start of this year translated into a jump in spare capacity from to in a matter of weeks bank of america merrill lynch stated
throttling back on production simply means there is more supply sitting on the sidelines ready to go in the event of an outage

the growing spare capacity volumes should keep prices anchored in a to range even if prompt brent crude oil prices rebound above over the course of as we currently project bank of america merrill lynch one enormous source of uncertainty is the trajectory of the global economy
manufacturing activity has dipped in multiple places around the world particularly in china
china has seen the most significant drop in activity when looking at the pmis bofaml analysts wrote
and of course china has remained the pillar of global demand for most commodities in the past two also china just reported another month of poor auto sales adding to the evidence of a potential for a hard landing in china is the largest downside risk to bank of america s oil market forecast
at the same time it isn t just the prospect of a global slowdown that threatens oil demand

bank of america sees oil demand hitting a peak in but as soon as the demand growth will fall by half compared to this year s growth there are a few more reasons why bank of america believes oil prices will trade within a relatively narrow range
opec has shown a willingness to cede market share as shale output continues to expand
that keeps prices from gyrating too much
meanwhile last year president trump and the government put pressure on saudi arabia to take action to keep prices in check whenever they rose too much
political pressure could limit the upside to crude prices

over the past year the more prices rose the faster shale grew
american shale companies are still struggling to report profits but recent history has demonstrated that the flood of wall street finance has increased anytime oil prices have climbed
ultimately when looking out over a few years this leads bank of america to conclude that prices will remain in echoes the shale band theory that emerged a few years ago
price increases are met with faster shale supply which drags prices back down
conversely any plunge in oil prices knocks shale offline which firms up the market again
the responsiveness of shale keeps prices within a narrower band than has historically been the case
prior to the shale revolution the oil market overshot to the upside and downside to a much greater degree owing to the inelasticity of conventional supply
many analysts believe that is no longer the case because of short bank of america sees oil prices rising to per barrel in the short run but trading within a to range through the nick cunningham of top reads from
