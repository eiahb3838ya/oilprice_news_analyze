how president trump is undermining u.s. oil producers
president trump recently took credit for the plunge in oil prices since early october
as i noted in a recent article it s true that the president s actions have contributed to the drop in oil prices but at a cost that has been largely week the president decided to share the credit for lower oil prices on twitter click to enlarge president trump thanks saudi arabia for low oil president trump affected oil priceslet s trade war with china resulted in china halting imports of oil
prior to that oil producers had been shipping half a million barrels a day to china
this loss of market hurt oil producers and helped push inventories higher in the
this further hurt oil producers by pushing prices leading up to the implementation of sanctions on iran that would cut off their oil exports president trump persuaded saudi arabia to begin pumping more oil to compensate for iran s pending lost just before sanctions were set to go into effect president trump announced that waivers would be given to a number of countries to allow them to continue to import iranian oil
among those countries was china which means oil producers lost business to iran as a result of this falloutsaudi arabia was caught off guard by the decision to grant waivers which resulted in too much oil in the market
the price of oil predictably plunged but saudi arabia has vowed to cut production
they are also working with other countries to engineer an even bigger production president is now attempting to pacify saudi arabia by giving the country a pass on the murder of dissident journalist jamal khashoggi in october and by publicly thanking them on twitter
but that will be unlikely to compensate for billions in lost revenue over what saudi arabia undoubtedly considers to be a double cross
related saudi oil output hits record high in novemberso the cost of lower oil prices has been the loss of a growing market for oil producers a weakening of the sanctions against iran and an increase in mistrust from saudi oil prices hurt the oil industrypresident trump seems to have a blind spot on oil prices that might have been appropriate a dozen years ago when the was a net importer of million barrels a day of petroleum and petroleum products
but this summer net imports fell to just under two million barrels a day and they are on a trajectory to reach zero in a few years
that is unless we enact policies that hurt the oil the logic of the tariffs president trump has pushed
yes they will drive up prices for consumers but the argument is that it will ultimately benefit the by bringing manufacturing back to the country
how is this different from high oil prices
they incentivize oil producers which lowers our dependence on foreign oil
the impact on consumers seems to be a political consideration when it comes to gasoline prices but not on all of the products that are being affected by trump has an outdated view on oil prices and one that is inconsistent with his logic on tariffs
if he wants to ensure a robust oil industry that could increasingly marginalize saudi arabia s influence he needs to stop undermining the oil robert rapiermore top reads from
