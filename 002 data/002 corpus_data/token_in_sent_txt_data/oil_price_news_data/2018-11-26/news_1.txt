the real effect of iran sanction waivers
on the day sanctions against iran went into effect brent crude traded at us a barrel
today three weeks later brent is down to us a barrel and president trump is congratulating himself on the low oil prices
instead of shooting up to us oil prices are falling and the waivers granted to eight large iranian oil buyers are among the main reasons for this
but how long with the effect of the waivers last bloomberg last week published a of how much each of the seven importers that won waivers are allowed to continue importing from iran and the numbers suggest these seven countries could continue buying over a million bpd of iranian crude until the waivers expire next year
however the key word here is could japan for example
one of the world s top crude oil importers and a large client of iran stopped buying crude ahead of the sanctions to improve its chances of scoring a waiver
now that it has the waiver japanese refiners are still not sure they should resume buying iranian crude which makes one wonder why they even worked to secure a waiver if they were not going to use it
yet theoretically these refiners can import about bpd of iranian crude down from bpd before the korea is another reluctant buyer because of its close links with the united states
the country was granted a waiver that would allow it to import iranian crude at a rate of bpd over a period of six months but refiners have yet to resume imports
related could oil prices fall to india and china are importing iranian crude the former at the allowed rate of some bpd according to order data
the latter china was allowed to continue buying iranian crude at a rate of bpd but it also has rights to production from fields in iran where chinese companies have stakes so it may be getting more than is the country that has had to slash its intake of iranian crude the most and it is also the country that would have the biggest problem finding an affordable alternative to iranian crude when the waivers expire
india was lucky pessimistic forecasts for the global economy and indications of oversupply pressured prices but this may only be temporary opec is talking about production cuts again after importers would also have to find alternative sources of crude that can compete with iranian crude on prices
these are to put it mildly few and far between since tehran is selling its crude at a discount to maintain market share
other producers can not afford to sell at such discounts
so what happens when the waivers expire importers would have two choices breach the sanctions and risk washington s wrath or switch to costlier crude which will be even costlier at the time because the end of the waivers will definitely have an impact on prices
these fatter oil import bills won t do much for these economies growth prospects and we just saw last month what pessimistic economic growth prospects do to oil demand outlooks and prices especially if they concern india and irina slav for top reads from
