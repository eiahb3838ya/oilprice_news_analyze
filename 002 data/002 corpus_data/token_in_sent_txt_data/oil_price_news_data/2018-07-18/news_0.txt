oil prices at risk of economic downturn
oil prices have retreated as disrupted supply from libya has started to come back online threatening the recent gains in oil prices
but a bigger threat to crude over the second half of and into is a slowdown in the global international monetary fund warned in its latest world economic outlook that a series of threats to economic growth are brewing
the fund maintained its projection for solid global gdp growth of percent for both and rather robust figures but said that the expansion is becoming less even and risks to the outlook are growth generally remains strong in advanced economies but it has slowed in many of them including countries in the euro area japan and the united kingdom the imf john kemp of reuters points out these are signs that the economy is in a late stage of an economic growth cycle with growth topping out inflation picking up rising interest rates and an inversion in the yield curve for treasuries which tends to precede has happened in the past the last phase of an economic expansion has often coincided with a surge in oil prices which is then followed by both a dip in oil prices and an economic contraction
the recessions following the price spikes in and are the most obvious but not the only take a different tack arguing that rising oil prices need not be a drag on the economy

the escalating trade war between the and china could derail the recovery and depress growth prospects the imf warned
indeed the fund said that the trade war poses the greatest threat to global but that isn t the only risk
rate tightening from the fed has helped strengthen the dollar which has put pressure on emerging markets
china s currency for instance has come under pressure in recent rate hikes and ongoing dollar strength also raises the risk of a downward correction in china s stock market
other countries have also suffered currency volatility including turkey argentina and corporate debt is at very high levels around levels that preceded the last two recessions as a percentage of gdp

financial markets seem broadly complacent in the face of these contingencies with elevated valuations and compressed spreads in many countries the imf warned
at the same time however high levels of public and private debt create widespread because assets prices are so high at this point they are susceptible to sudden if growth and expected corporate profits obviously an economic slowdown would have enormous ramifications for the oil market
china is already starting to show signs of a deceleration in oil demand with june imports declining by nearly percent
china s gdp growth rate dipped to a percent annualized rate in the second quarter after growing by percent the previous three isn t to say that a recession is imminent or that oil demand is set to fall off of a cliff but a growing number of economists say the likelihood of a recession setting in before is rising
