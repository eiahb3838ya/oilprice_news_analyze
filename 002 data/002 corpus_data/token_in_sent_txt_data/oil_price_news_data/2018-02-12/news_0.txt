opec unfazed as rivals boost oil output
in the aftermath of the wave of aggressive forecasts for supply growth from shale lately opec added its voice to the mix on monday acknowledging that its american rivals would add more oil onto the market than it previously to opec s latest forecast for supply will rise by million barrels per day this year an upward revision of bpd from last month s forecast
that is a rather large revision and it represents an acknowledgement that the cartel s strategy of keeping upwards of of supply off of the market has allowed a lot of runway for shale to ramp up
t he steady oil price recovery since summer and renewed interest in growth opportunities has led to oil majors catching up in terms of exploration activity this year both in the shale industry and offshore deep water opec wrote in its opec s president dismissed the warning signs from shale stating that soaring output would not derail opec s calculations or strategy
shale is coming and the expectation is that it will come stronger than in and this is something that we have to watch opec president and uae energy minister suhail al mazrouei said according to bloomberg
but considering all factors i don t think it will be a huge distorter of the the increase in output on an annual basis will be impressive production will rise by compared to levels according to opec s numbers
but opec sees most of the gains from the to be heavily frontloaded with dramatic gains coming in january february and march on top of the huge increases in the fourth quarter of
related shale companies are ready to expandoutput is choppier for the rest of the year with increases in some months but dips in others
crucially in december opec is forecasting oil production at which is essentially flat compared to current it also sees robust demand offsetting some of the concerns about too much supply
opec revised up its demand forecast by bpd from last month s report
the group also tried to remind the world that even as shale continues to rise so does demand
cumulatively between and the world has added around of demand for oil products on the back of healthy economic conditions globally and a relatively steady product price for this reason opec still sees a lot of upside in sticking with the cuts and letting the market continue to balance
it will still take some time to drain inventories especially given the fact that inventories will likely increase in the first half of the year
in line with the existing overhang the market is only expected to return to balance towards the end of this year opec wrote in its february oil market the same time the threat of new supply from opec is also looming just over the horizon
compliance remains strong opec production in january was mostly unchanged from december levels and by all indications compliance should remain as s p global platts notes opec members are gearing up for increases in production capacity as the oil market continues to move closer to balance
they may not ratchet up output just yet but they are beginning to signal their future plans to do example kuwait s oil minister recently stated that his country s capacity would rise to compared to its current
iran s oil minister promised threatened
to add bpd within days after the expiration of the opec agreement
uae hopes to add bpd of capacity over the course of this year
finally iraq has a goal of having the ability to export by the end of
we will not wait until the excess inventories get to zero before we do something if needed one source told s p global platts
related oil prices collapse now spike laterto be sure these are capacity additions not production
the output will likely remain on the sidelines as long as opec continues to work together and the supply curbs are kept in place
but as s p global platts argues the mere fact that more officials from these key countries are advertising their pending capacity additions could signal an eagerness to ramp up comments come as several oil market analysts have warned that opec could overtighten the market
goldman sachs recently argued that the market is probably already balanced and that because inventory data is published on a delay opec might end up draining inventories below the average
that could send prices up by summer when demand is at a seasonal the opec report is not nearly as bearish as the corresponding reports from the iea and eia and the group offers a mantra in the face of surging shale supply predicting a rebalancing later this nick cunningham of top reads from
