there’s no sugarcoating canada’s oil crisis
has financial disaster been averted in canada s oil and gas industry disaster is all relative
let s just say is going to be a difficult year following a tough set of recent thing we know is that the recent episode of commodity by a regional glut of oil and gas looking for a pipeline to call home combined with low international oil wounded this year s outlook for conventional oilfield activity
that s the segment of the business outside the oil sands where of the industry s spending typically the tight orbit of fort mcmurray s oil sands in the broader oil and gas fields of bc alberta and saskatchewan the overt indicator of sectoral health is drilling activity
like counting cars on a freeway you know the economy is bad if there are only a few commuters on the s looking pretty bad for the first quarter
we re entering the peak rush hour of the winter drilling season with only bits turning on active rigs
the level of activity is feeling a lot like the depths of the lowest new year s entry in decades see figure comparison last year at this time the rig count was climbing toward a more stable february peak of
but stability is hardly in the energy dictionary right now
volatile discounts weak international prices illiquid equity markets and a pipeline drama has spooked those with money and hollowed those without
it s pretty simple really no confidence plus no money equals no drilling
that s what was happening late last year
related woodmac lng glut not likely in said that the very real potential for fiscal disaster was averted
to clear the late production glut the government of alberta stepped into the market with a mandatory oil curtailment percent across the board
the goal was to restrain output until the market cleared
so far the policy seems to be working
domestic price discounts have snapped back to after accounting for usual quality and transportation differences
if plays out according to plan the curtailment should be lifted by and various increased rail movement pipeline enhancements to boost unused capacity and other supply chain keep the discounts in the first quarter has a sinking feeling the outlook heading into summer may be better
spending and drilling should strengthen into the back half of the year though there is little doubt that as a whole will record fewer new oil and gas wells compared to the in each of the past two current malaise is not only about canadian issues including pipeline delays price discounts and policy angst
a major factor is oil price

if lasts for more than a couple of months worldwide drilling activity will pull back there is a new resiliency in the world of oil
the competitive pressures of the last four years has forced adaptation to significantly lower prices as well as the additional costs of environmental pressures
globally leading multinationals and progressive independent operators with assets can now be quite active at us many are here in canada
on the flip side producers that are blind to innovation and still pining for remain prices and hard times are frustrating disagreeable and outright demoralizing in any business think retail
during such times progressive companies sharpen their pencils and necessarily figure out how to adapt
this has been happening in the global oil and gas industry
and it s been forced acutely on canada s industry where prices have stubbornly bobbed below international there is no sugar coating to be had
the start to is going to be a difficult one in the canadian oil patch
but they say what doesn t kill you makes you stronger
given all the forces of change at play domestic and international some in the industry will falter
others will regroup and innovate becoming leaner and stronger ready to take on the peter tertzakianmore top reads from
