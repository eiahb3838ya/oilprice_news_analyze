are conventional producers really losing influence?
energy professionals and others following the developments in the oil and gas industry during the last couple of years have witnessed a massive rise in reporting concerning hydraulic fracturing technology
the role of conventional oil could easily be undervalued considering the rising importance of shale oil
although hydraulic fracturing has changed the market significantly conventional producers still make up the bulk of today s oil mix
production of shale oil in the is poised to grow even further in the coming years
however basic economic fundamentals such as profitability and availability bode well for conventional producers and especially for those in the middle oil s technical and geographic soft spotdespite shale oil s impressive rise in production the majority of the world s oil is produced from conventional fields which hold around of the global recoverable resources
opec s member countries possess the bulk of these assets with nearly percent of the total
of this amount percent is in the middle east led by saudi arabia iran iraq kuwait and the uae
the technical advantages of oil recovery from this region are that production is relatively easy and cheap
black gold in the middle east is amassed in large deposits near the surface either onshore or in relatively shallow waters
this means that the world s oil producers with the lowest breakeven costs are saudi arabia iran and iraq with costs between the and dollars a barrel in
the immense size of middle eastern oil fields and the relative ease with which it can be extracted have made it the most important oil production region since the second world oil s decreasing role outside of the middle eastthe world produced almost million bpd per day in
both production and consumption are set to rise even further in
conventional production beyond the middle east peaked in and expectations are that production will continue to fall to million barrels a day in which is a decline from the current level
furthermore global consumption is set to rise even further reaching in
this additional demand will be met primarily by shale new deepwater oil production and conventional oil producers from the middle east
related opec s boosted production exports just before cuts began click to enlarge analysts expect middle eastern oil production to grow by by
the extra barrels will be supplied by iraq approx
and by the presumed resumption of production in the neutral zone between saudi arabia and kuwait
the uae hasn t announced large production increases but the emirates have the capacity to do so when proper investments are made
also statements concerning iran s future level of production are unreliable due to political risks associated with the trump administration or any future president s policy oil s influence on global pricestraditionally opec has dominated global oil markets and price setting
however with the introduction of shale oil a new bandwidth has been introduced
following the experience of the last couple of years concerning wild oil price swings most analysts agree that shale oil production growth is capped by dollars a barrel
the price of wti indexed oil was on average and
the price of oil below has caused a decreasing of activity in the shale oil sector in the related maduro clings to power as venezuela s oil collapse continuesthe flexibility of fracking technology and quick investment returns mean that shale producers are sensitive to price swings
this in turn introduces a new balancing force in the oil market meaning that when price drop below economic activity will also reduce quickly in the shale oil production areas
the same logic is also applied when prices rise towards when most shale oil fields become profitable and increased production lowers prices again
conventional shalethe major difference between shale and conventional oil producers is flexibility meaning that the former can produce oil in a shorter period of time with lower investments
however the introduction of a new ceiling for oil prices could also be good news for conventional producers in the long term in especially the middle east
the price for a barrel of oil will most likely hover between and dollars
this will ensure a steady demand while evs face strong competition from the combustion engine due to low energy prices
taking into consideration the relatively low production costs of middle eastern energy the biggest oil reserves in the world and growing demand globally producers in the region continue to reap the rewards in the long term
