canadaâ€™s crude oil production cuts are unsustainable
in an attempt to combat a ballooning oil glut and dramatically plummeting prices the premier of alberta rachel notley introduced an unprecedented measure at the beginning of december when she is mandating that oil companies in her province cut production
this directive was particularly surprising in the context of canada s free market economy where oil production is rarely so directly s recent oil glut woes are not due to a lack of demand but rather a severe lack of pipeline infrastructure
there is plenty of demand and more than enough supply but no way to get the oil flowing where it needs to go
canada s pipelines are running at maximum capacity storage facilities are filled to bursting and the pipeline bottleneck has only continued to worsen
now in an effort to alleviate the struggling industry alberta s oil production has been cut percent according to the mandate set by the province s government under rachel notley with the objective of cutting out around barrels per day from the canadian before the government stepped in some private oil companies had already production caps in order to combat the glut and oil prices
cenovus energy canadian natural resource devon energy athabasca oil and others announced curtailments that totaled around barrels a day and cenovus energy one of canada s major producers even went so far as to plead with the government to impose production caps late last far the productive caps have been extremely successful
in october canadian oil prices were so depressed that the canadian benchmark oil western canadian select wcs was trading at a whopping per barrel less than united states benchmark oil west texas intermediate wti
now in the wake of production cuts the price gap between wcs and wti has diminished by a dramatic margin to a difference of just under per barrel
related the natural gas crash isn t overwhile on the surface this would seem to be a roundly glowing review of the production caps in alberta production cuts are not a solution for canada s oil glut woes
the current production caps in canada are only intended to last through the middle of this year at which point canadian oil companies will be permitted to decrease their cutbacks to just barrels per day fewer than the numbers from november s production rates
the cuts are a just a treatment not a cure for oversupply in alberta
the problem needs to be addressed at its source the the pipeline shortage in alberta has no quick and easy fix
while there are multiple major pipeline projects underway the two largest the keystone xl pipeline and the trans mountain pipeline are stalled indefinitely thanks to legal woes and seemingly endless litigation
the enbridge line pipeline intended to replace one of the region s already existing pipelines is currently under construction and projected to be up and running by the end of the year but will not go a long way toward fixing the if the albertan government the present expiration date for the current stricter production cuts extending the production caps could have enduring negative consequences in the region s oil industry
keeping a cap on production in alberta would potentially discourage investment in future production as well as in the infrastructure the local industry so sorely needs
according to some reporting the cuts will not be able to control the gap between canadian and oil for much longer anyway just another downside to drawing out what should be a solution
the government will need to weigh the possible outcomes very carefully as the expiration date approaches when the and the pipeline shortage is still a long way from being solved and the price of oil remains dangerously variable
