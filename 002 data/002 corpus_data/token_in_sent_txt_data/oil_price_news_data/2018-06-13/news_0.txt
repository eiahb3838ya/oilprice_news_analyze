iea: oil prices could rise further as shale canâ€™t fill the gap
shale will continue its breakneck growth rate into despite bottlenecks but the oil market still faces serious supply risks from the potential losses from venezuela and iran the international energy agency iea said in a new iea said that the run up in oil prices in the last few months dampened oil demand growth although the agency left its forecast for oil demand growth unchanged at million barrels per day after downgrading that estimate last month
subsidies and price regulation in a growing number of countries intended to blunt the impact of rising fuel prices could keep demand growth on track despite oil prices trading significantly higher than say a year ahead to the iea thinks that oil demand growth will expand by yet another this time with the help of the petrochemical sector
a number of projects are coming online earlier than expected adding more consumption to the mix
the demand estimate is a rather strong one given substantial expansion in demand over the past few are risks to that forecast including a weakening of economic confidence trade protectionism and a potential further strengthening of the us dollar the iea said
those factors should not be overlooked
indeed strong demand does not stand independent of the price variable for instance
how this plays out is unclear but with the oil market now much tighter than at any point in the last few years strong demand going forward will start to drive up prices much more than it did in the supply side of the equation is much more interesting
on the positive side of the ledger the iea sees supply growing by in followed by another jump of in
the makes up three quarters of both of those production from shale has not been without stress the iea notes citing the discount for wti relative to brent and an even greater discount for oil located in midland texas where all of that oil is coming from
the iea does not seem overly concerned about the pipeline bottlenecks in the permian noting that much of the issue will be resolved with new capacity by the end of next year
related oil prices rebound on crude gasoline inventory draws we think that in texas by there will be a net of additional pipeline capacity beyond our earlier number albeit with most of it coming on line in the second half of the year the iea wrote
in the meantime capacity will likely remain tight but production will still be able to grow strongly by this year and in however while soaring shale output would seem to keep the oil market catastrophic declines in venezuela and potentially in iran could keep things rather tight
the iea said it is conceivable that the two beleaguered opec members both of which are staring down sanctions could lose of supply combined by the end of will likely respond to these potential losses and the iea guesses that the cartel will add somewhere around in fairly short president donald trump added further pressure on the cartel in a tweet on wednesday
the message to opec ahead of its meeting and in particular to trump s ally saudi arabia is a not a very subtle prices are too high opec is at it again
not good still just because opec is on the verge of adding supply back into the market that does not mean that everyone can rest easy
e ven if the supply gap is plugged the market will be finely balanced next year and vulnerable to prices rising higher in the event of further disruption the iea said
it is possible that the very small number of countries with spare capacity beyond what can be activated quickly will have to go the extra indeed spare capacity could be drawn down to the lowest level in decades if opec and russia decide to increase output
while raising production will help meet demand it also eats away at the surplus buffer that saudi arabia in particular has available on the sidelines
low spare capacity creates a lot of price risk in the event of additional outages
and given the instability in places like libya and nigeria plus question marks about how low output in venezuela and iran could go it is safe to assume that more surprises are coming down the nick cunningham of top reads from
