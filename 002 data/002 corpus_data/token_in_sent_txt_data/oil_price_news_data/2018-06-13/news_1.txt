the decisive battle for yemenâ€™s oil port
an arab coalition led by saudi arabia and the uae have started their expected military assault on the yemeni port of hodeidah
this military operation will most probably decide the outcome of the ongoing civil war between the internationally recognized yemeni government and the houthi rebels which are supported by iran and hezbollah
while international pressure has been mounting on the arab coalition not to attack hodeidah with aid agencies worried about the consequences for civilians saudi arabia and its allies consider military action the only solution to quell the houthi threat
while the outcome of this attack will have a significant impact on the conflict it is unlikely to end the civil war as large parts of yemen are still under the control of the houthis and other regions are controlled by al first media reports detailed the arab coalition battling houthi rebels in the port city of hodeidah
the first assault is reported to have come from houthi positions in the suburbs of seham and qazabah
as well as engagements on land saudi and uae ships have positioned themeselves just south of the city
some reports have even stated that an arab coalition navy vessel has been destroyed

saudi arabia however claims that the port has been a lifeline for the houthi rebel forces with ships from iran and elsewhere sending military supplies to the houthis
last week the un warned that urban fighting could endanger the lives of up to people
a statement from yemen s exiled government which is supported by saudi and uae forces said that all peaceful and political means to remove the houthis had failed
since hodeidah has been held by the houthis
the current military operation is meant to end this situation by force
european governments have been very critical of the arab coalition s operations in yemen despite the threat posed by houthi militia to international shipping lines via the red sea and the gulf of aden
the country has also become a breeding ground for al qaeda forces something that the international community is eager to deal the last few days the has become increasingly involved in the yemen conflict
after threats made by washington to block any support to the arab coalition if conflict was escalated a new dialogue emerged
riyadh and abu dhabi have stated openly that they will not attack hodeidah without support
that statement and the actions that followed suggests that washington may well have given the green light to end the houthi role in yemen
equally it is possible that the saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman and his counterpart abu dhabi s crown prince mohammed bin zayed have decided that it is worth the risk
related the oil giant that saw its cash reserves plunge for washington and the west the yemen crisis has been quite far down the pecking order of geopolitical threats
for the oil industry however the threat of heaving an iranian backed houthi regime wielding power on yemen s main strategic geographic could be considered a nightmare scenario
the conflict in the area presents a threat to international shipping lanes in the region that should not be taken lightly
the houthis have attacked maritime traffic in the red sea and aden area several times using iranian supplied missiles the majority of the time
the strategic position of yemen should not be underestimated
looking at the militarization of the horn of africa where all parties including uae turkey qatar china and even iran are setting up military bases a military doomsday scenario could be looming
with and chinese forces in djibouti and other countries setting up military basis or even building new navy ports a combined of africa iranian power projection could be threatening the world s most important sea lane
looking at oil and gas volumes slated to be more than million bpd of oil and more than of global lng its closure would be disastrous to european and markets
its closure would force oil and lng tankers to sail around the southern tip of africa tying up tankers for weeks and driving up costs
removing this threat is seem by some as not only a necessity for yemen and the arab coalition members but also for the global the current military operation is however not successful a from the houthis and possibly supporting countries is to be expected
this could lead to a renewed threat for oil and gas shipping lanes making markets tighter cyril widdershoven for top reads from
