shale profits remain elusive
this time was supposed to be different
this year was supposed to be the year in which the shale industry proved that after years of frustrating investors they would finally start dishing out hefty returns after earning stacks of international energy agency said a few weeks ago that was shaping up to be a turning point
higher prices and operational improvements are putting the us shale sector on track to achieve positive free cash flow in for the first time ever the iea industry had succeeded in lower costs so much that they could turn a profit the thinking goes even with oil prices trading at around per barrel
the rise in oil prices over the last year was supposed to be an unexpected bonus definitively pushing drillers into profitable a new report from the wall street journal finds that the shale industry is once again coming up short
using data from factset wsj found that roughly major oil producers burned through billion more than they generated in the second quarter
while shale drillers succeeded in lowering costs during the oil market downturn that began in those efficiency gains have largely been tapped beginning last year a renewed drilling frenzy particularly in the permian has led to a rebound in costs
many shale executives had promised that the cost efficiencies were structural locked in and would not reverse
but that is now looking to be overly financials have improved but they re not there yet in terms of making money todd heltman a senior energy analyst at investment firm neuberger berman group llc told the wsj
the realization is setting in that it s going to take longer than investors thought for them to generate free cash flow and deliver more powerful related oil prices jump as saudis cap oil supplypioneer natural resources a top driller in texas conceded that costs are rising faster than expected
we had a more significant increase in cost issue than we would have assumed timothy dove pioneer s ceo told investors on an earnings call
the company had higher costs for electricity because of hot weather in texas in may and june
labor costs also continued to climb problem grows worse for permian producers that have not secured hedges for their oil sales
higher costs are running up against pipeline constraints which has led to discounts for oil in midland in excess of per barrel relative to wti in for sand water drilling crews equipment and other services have all been rising
the wsj reports that more than a dozen shale companies announced in their second quarter earnings reports that they either would have to spend more to produce the same amount of oil and gas lowered this year s production guidance or they missed second quarter production figures
the wsj singled out noble energy which revised up its expected spending levels for this year while conceding that its production would come in at the lower end of its expected range
on an unrelated note noble is also uniquely vulnerable to potential drilling restrictions in colorado s dj basin that will be put up to a public referendum in november flip side of that is that slower activity could keep cost inflation in check something that pioneer s timothy dove tried to tell shareholders
a slowdown in well completions does not bode well for increases in costs when activity levels are coming down dove said on an earnings call
and you see some of the big service companies now saying we not bringing additional for example frac fleets into the basin while margins are not improving any more than they related why is big oil so excited about alaskan crude the slowdown in drilling could ease the pressure he argues
and so i think we could have a situation where if we can stagnate oil prices where they are today we might be able to put more of a lid on service cost increases and cost increases in general in as compared to this year just a product of a slowdown in relative completion that isn t a saving grace for companies are that are also cutting back on expansion plans
and when pipelines do come online over the next few years drilling activity will pick up all over again
shale companies will rush to work through the backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells ducs which has exploded over the past months potentially all at the same time
t hat could be another period of inflationary activity to the point where everyone is trying to get their duc count reduced dove said
and so i would say the bigger risk is really past
it really and in short the cost inflation that many in the shale industry had hoped to keep at bay is only getting nick cunningham of top reads from
