as the trade war escalates a growing number of analysts and organizations have increased warnings that further trade tensions could dent economic growth consumer spending and investment flows of which could curtail the world s oil demand oil demand geopolitical tensions plunging venezuelan production libyan outages and returning sanctions on iran s oil have all combined at various times to boost crude oil prices so far this numerous challenges to the global economic growth have recently emerged with political uncertainties taking center stage opec said in its closely watched monthly oil market report momr on these political uncertainties it is developments in particular that warrant close monitoring in the opec said noting that the strong economic growth forecast assumes that there won t be significant rises in trade tariffs and current disputes will be resolved rising trade tensions leading to mounting uncertainties translating into falling business and consumer sentiment may provide a significant downside risk to the current relatively positive outlook
negative impacts on global investments capital flows and consumer spending may also have a detrimental effect on the global oil market opec has modeled four different scenarios to quantify the likely impact of trade tariffs on the global economy and global oil demand
to be sure the most likely scenario according to the cartel is that the trade spat continues between the and china and the most likely case will not have a significant impact on global gdp or oil demand growth in and in the scenario however global economic growth is seen at percent this year and at percent next year compared to a base case forecast of growth for and percent in
in terms of oil demand growth in the scenario where trade tariffs include regions beyond the and china opec sees demand rising by million bpd in and by just million bpd in compared to the current base case estimates of million bpd growth this year and million bpd next year
