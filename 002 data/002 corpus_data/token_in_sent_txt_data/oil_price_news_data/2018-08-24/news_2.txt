iran has delivered absolutely into france or the netherlands this month when it is typically a regular supplier
based on our projections nothing is set to be discharged in the coming on the other hand has already delivered over million barrels to these two countries so far in august higher than any monthly volume in the last year and we still have a week of the month left to go
