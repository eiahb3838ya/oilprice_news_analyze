mexicoâ€™s new president to deal blow to oil industry
mexico will likely halt oil auctions for at least two years dealing a blow to its oil s andres manuel lopez obrador amlo will reportedly suspend oil auctions for at least two years according to the wall street journal with some experts believing that his administration won t hold any new oil auctions at all during his term
he has also vowed to review the contracts already awarded to companies through auctions over the last few years to check for corruption although he has said he would not try to invalidate them so long as they check amlo wants to revise some of the energy laws that govern the oil and gas sector which could dramatically alter the landscape for foreign oil and gas companies
he long opposed the historic reforms that ended seven decades of state control over the energy sector although he moderated his position during this year s presidential campaign
rolling back the reforms would be exceedingly difficult requiring a change to the country s amlo wants more modest though still significant legislative changes
the wsj reports that he will pursue legislative tweaks that bolster the power of pemex while weakening the regulatory body that has pursued a technocratic approach and presided over the oil auctions over the last three s desired changes include allowing pemex to choose its own partners without needing the approval from regulators
current rules require pemex to partner with the highest bidder for blocks put up for a
he wants the government to be able to award pemex with oil blocks directly
and he wants to make pemex the sole marketer of oil produced by private firms the wsj a oil war could break up opecthese changes would amount to a partial rollback of the energy reforms pemex and government control over the oil sector
moreover as president amlo chooses the head of pemex granting him a lot of leverage over the company
if licensing rounds are canceled and joint ventures are the only vehicle for entry to the country it reflects a consolidation of power within pemex maria cortez latin america upstream senior research manager at wood mackenzie told bloomberg in an email
that could be viewed negatively by outside on top of that the wsj says amlo will push to raise local content rules which would require a higher percentage of domestic involvement in oil projects
that means that if a company like exxonmobil or chevron or some other outside entity wants to drill for oil in mexico it would need to source a certain percentage of equipment and services from within mexico
the idea is to capture a greater portion of the benefits of oil and gas development for the country while also building up expertise for local many of these changes will be loathsome to the international oil companies who will view them as onerous burdens that inject higher levels of uncertainty into their investments
oil companies have repeatedly blamed strict local content rules in brazil for years of cost inflation and if all of this is confirmed it would send a signal that the continuity of the oil opening may be in doubt pablo medina an analyst with welligence energy analytics a research firm based in houston told the wsj in an what caused oil s longest losing streak in years meanwhile in addition to the legislative changes to the energy reforms amlo s core energy plan consists of pouring billions of dollars back into pemex for oil exploration with a particular focus on revitalizing the downstream sector
he wants billion to rehabilitate mexico s six aging oil refineries plus more than billion to build a new refinery from scratch
the idea is to cut down or even eliminate gasoline imports from the united states

the iea sees output falling by another bpd this year due to the aging offshore oil fields although that is a narrower decline compared to the bpd the country lost last is aiming to boost production by bpd over the next two years which will be a monumental task
if he is to succeed amlo is betting that pemex will lead the nick cunningham of top reads from
