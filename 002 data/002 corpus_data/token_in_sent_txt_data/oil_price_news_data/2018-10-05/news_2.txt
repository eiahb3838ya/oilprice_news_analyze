iea: plastics will replace fuels as key oil demand driver
plastics will displace fuels as the main driver for crude oil demand the international energy agency said today adding that petrochemicals will come to account for more than percent of oil demand growth globally in the period to
by they will drive half of the global oil demand growth raising this demand by million bpd by that report that contains the projection is titled the future of petrochemicals and the iea said it was part of a series of reports that aim to uncover blind spots or facets of the global energy industry that receive less attention than they are indeed big oil s big hope for the the more distant future
petrochemicals are used in thousands of products with the biggest group among these being plastic products
the bad news for oil is that green initiatives around the world are mounting and many of them are targeting precisely this group of products
and yet even if plastic products are removed from the supply chain enough demand will remain to drive the consumption of crude petrochemicals are one of the key blind spots in the global energy debate especially given the influence they will exert on future energy trends iea s head fatih birol said
petrochemicals are not just the plastics we see in grocery bags
petrochemical products are also essential in renewable energy installations such as solar panels and wind turbines but also batteries and thermal insulation and thousands of other products and durability of petrochemicals demand is evident in the demand growth trends the iea says demand for plastics has almost doubled over the last years exceeding the demand growth rate of every other bulk material including steel aluminum and cement
perhaps more importantly emerging markets have yet to catch up to developed ones in their plastics consumption
now that s a guarantee for steady demand in the irina slav for top reads from
