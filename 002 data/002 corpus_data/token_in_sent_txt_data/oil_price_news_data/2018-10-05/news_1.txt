coal use rises as renewables fall in u.s. electricity generation
the eia released the latest edition of their electric power monthly on september with data for july
the table above shows the percentage contribution of the main fuel sources to two decimal places for the last two months and the year to date
click to enlarge click to enlarge for the month of july the total amount of electricity generated was the second highest amount generated for any single month since january at gwh gwh less than the amount generated in july
coal and natural gas fueled almost percent of us electricity generation in july and while the contribution from coal increased from percent in june to percent in july the contribution from natural gas also increased by slightly more than five percentage points reaching an unprecedented percent up from percent in june
nuclear power generated gwh percent more than it did in june but due to the increase in total generation the percentage contribution to the total actually declined to percent from percent in july the contribution from all renewables at percent fell further below that from nuclear at percent similar to july when the ramp up of total generation resulted in the percentage contribution from all renewables falling further below that from nuclear
the absolute contribution from solar declined from it s all time high in june of gwh to gwh with the corresponding percentage contribution declining to percent as opposed to percent in june
the amount of electricity generated by wind decreased by almost percent from gwh to gwh and coupled with the increased total generation the percentage contribution declined from percent to percent in july
the contribution from hydro decreased percent from gwh in june to gwh resulting in the percentage contribution decreasing from percent in june to percent
the combined contribution from wind and solar decreased to percent from percent in june
consequently the contribution from renewables also decreased to percent from percent
the contribution of zero emission and carbon neutral sources that is nuclear hydro wind solar geothermal landfill gas and other biomass decreased to percent from percent in june
related the pitfall for oil pricesthe graph below helps to illustrate how the changes in absolute production affect the percentage contribution from the various sources
click to enlarge the chart below shows the total monthly generation at utility scale facilities by year versus the contribution from solar
the scale is for the total generation while the right hand scale is for solar output and has been deliberately set to exaggerate the solar output as a means of assessing it s potential to make a meaningful contribution to the midsummer peak
the scale on the y axes has been adjusted to display twh instead of gwh as suggested by dennis coyne earlier this year to make the comparison a little easier
in july the output from solar at gwh was times what it was four years ago in july
solar energy appears to have peaked in june the month of the summer solstice so it is looking like the peak monthly output for is likely to be gwh barring the remote chance that more is generated in august

in july natural gas contributed percent of new capacity
with percent of new capacity coming from wind and solar contributing percent natural gas solar and wind made up almost percent of new capacity in saudi arabia to splash on oil capacity boostthe only capacity added that is not fueled by natural gas wind or solar was a cogen plant fueled by distillate fuel oil at the loma linda university
in july the total added capacity reported was mw compared to the mw added in may

in july the only retirements were three units powered by internal combustion engines fueled by landfill gas two mw units in maryland and a mw unit in texas for a total of mw
