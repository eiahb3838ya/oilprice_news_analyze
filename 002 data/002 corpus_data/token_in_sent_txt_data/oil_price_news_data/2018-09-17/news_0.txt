is the shale slowdown overblown?
the shale industry has hit a bit of a rough patch with pipeline bottlenecks cost inflation and a crowded field contributing to a drilling and production slowdown
but many in the industry are confident that the lull will be are several strategies that shale companies are starting to pursue such as pivoting to other shale plays curtailing drilling activity or drilling wells but deferring completions
according to halliburton s ceo jeff miller as reported by argus media these strategies are actually relieving a bit of pressure on the permian basin and the cost inflation that has come with the concentration of drilling and the associated the permian runs into trouble shale companies are pivoting to the eagle ford the bakken the niobrara and even wyoming s powder river basin according to comments from executives at a recent conference hosted by barclays
in fact a flurry of research reports from top investment banks recently also back up the notion that the shale industry will continue to press forward despite significant headwinds
in june the latest month for which solid production data is available the eia said that output rose by bpd and about bpd of that total came from texas evidence that the permian has not been suffering from a slowdown at least as of sachs says that the growth will continue and the bank pointed to the fact that the shale industry has increased spending over the course of this year above original guidance
w e maintain our outlook for mn bpd of us oil production growth in though with producers increasing budgets by in aggregate there could be potential for upside to our mn bpd growth estimate in as capital spend in translates into higher growth into goldman analysts wrote in a note earlier this month
the impact of these capex increases plus permian bottlenecks in are likely to be related can india afford to cut iranian imports to zero for its part bank of america merrill lynch says that aside from spending increases improvements in drilling mean that shale companies can continue to grow production while spending less
since drilling times have fallen by roughly in most of the major oil producing basins resulting in fewer rigs needed to do the same work bank of america merrill lynch said last week
laterals are longer frac stages have increased and the amount of sand has also the same time because there have been bottlenecks for things like water disposal and frac sand which has been shipped in from wisconsin and minnesota new water handling services and frac sand mines have opened in texas another way that the industry has kept costs down
these factors combined have significantly improved capital efficiency and have allowed producers to grow output at a similar pace to while spending roughly less bank of america merrill lynch efficiency gains have been important those factors arguably pale in comparison to the increase in the price of oil
without diminishing the significance of efficiency gains we emphasize that a higher price environment always triggers additional activity in less commercial acreage positions rystad energy said in a recent report
in the same way an oil price collapse leads to unsustainable activity in acreage of low the consultancy argued that most shale companies have based their budgets and capex plans on a conservative oil price of per barrel so the gains this year have led to cash as for the pipeline bottlenecks the shale industry expects to ride out the storm expecting new pipelines to come online in a little over a the millennials making millions in texas oilall told many see the bottlenecks as a concern that could slow production growth but ultimately shale executives are confident that new pipelines will ease the burden by late or early
also many think that the cost inflation hitting the permian is somewhat tolerable
by and large efficiency and productivity gains have helped offset rising service inflation costs with some exceptions in the permian
in fact producers and service companies alike forecast costs to soften in barclays said in a note summarizing the findings from its recent industry everyone is on board with this sentiment
the eia expects output to plateau through and next year close to million barrels per day before advancing in as new permian pipelines come into operation standard chartered wrote in a note
however the current forecast for december is lower than previous forecasts for april
we think the risks to us output are to the downside we forecast growth of below the eia s estimates from various forecasters always span the spectrum so take each one with a grain of nick cunningham of top reads from
