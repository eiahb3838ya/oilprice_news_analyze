a storm is brewing for u.s. oil exports
two geopolitical developments in recent
sanctions on iran and the escalating trade set to reshuffle the oil flows to the world s oil market the one hand the united states is pressing iran s oil customers to cut their iranian crude imports by as much as possible
china is tehran s biggest oil buyer and india is its second
while india is reportedly preparing for a drastic reduction of iranian oil imports china will continue to buy iranian the other hand china is threatening to impose a tariff on crude oil and oil products after the trade war took a turn for the worse in recent weeks
such a tariff would make american crude oil uncompetitive in china and oil sellers will have to find alternative buyers for their crude to replace the volumes they are currently selling to their oil customer after is an obvious imports and demand are surging and it may be willing to replace at least part of its iranian oil imports out of fear that its companies and the sovereign could lose access to the financial system should it continue to buy iran s the problem with india possibly replacing iranian oil with crude is that american light oil isn t a substitute for heavy iranian began regular imports last year but the volumes are currently small especially compared to the crude exports to china eia data shows
but in may india s imports of crude oil jumped by nine times the april that at least a partial switch is already underway

indian refiners can t absorb all the oil that was going to china
they can import more but can they process it if china follows through with its threat to slap tariffs on oil imports it would put downward pressure on the wti crude benchmark and widen its discount to brent crude which could be make oil even more attractive to indian buyers according to analysts doubt that the united states will be able to easily find alternative buyers for the oil it has been selling to may raise its oil imports but it would hardly be able to replace all the american oil that a chinese tariff could possibly cut while china could secure the crude from alternative sources such as west africa which has a similar quality to crude the would find it hard to find an alternative market that is as big as china suresh sivanandam senior manager asia refining at wood mackenzie said last month commenting on the impact of possible chinese tariffs on oil to woodmac crude oil exports to china averaged around bpd in the first quarter this year accounting for just over percent of all crude oil chinese buyer is said to have already suspended imports of oil turning to iran as one of its alternative sources of crude
related how bad is iran s oil situation as far as india s imports of iranian oil are concerned there have been signs that buyers are preparing plans in case they are unable to import tehran crude when the sanctions will first cater to its own national interest its oil minister dharmendra pradhan said in an interview with businessline published over the we will first look at our national interest
india s energy basket has multiple sources now
our focus will be to see that our requirement is not affected and to ensure this we will do what we have to do
but we will also keep a watch on global pradhan told and the oil interests and oil flows of the china india and iran india alone may not be enough to absorb the oil exports to china currently america s single oil customer after tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
