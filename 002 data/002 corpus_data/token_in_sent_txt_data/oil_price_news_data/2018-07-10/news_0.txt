spare capacity: the biggest mystery in oil markets
with around million barrels per day of iranian supply targeted by the trump administration how will the oil market cope with the losses
is there enough supply capacity to make up for the shortfall there is a great deal of debate about the true extent of the world s spare capacity
or more precisely there are a range of guesses over how much surplus is located in saudi arabia the one country that really has the ability to ramp up large volumes of supply on short arabia claims it could produce if it really needed to
however that claim has not been put to the test
saudi arabia s highest level of production was just over in just before it helped engineer the production around of extra supply as president trump demands is a tall order
more recent history shows saudi has never produced more than on average over a single month
and even in the recent period we have observed a steep decline in domestic saudi oil inventories bank of america merrill lynch wrote in a note arguing that there is plenty of reason to question the notion that saudi arabia has around of idled capacity
thus it appears the oil market has little confidence that iran volumes can be easily the international energy agency estimates that there is around of total global spare capacity that can truly be ramped up in a short period of time
a looser definition of spare capacity that encompasses the ability to add supply over several months puts the figure at about percent of which is located in saudi arabia
smaller additions come from the uae kuwait iraq and problem is that saudi arabia is already ramping up output to replace lost barrels elsewhere
saudi arabia added bpd in june compared to a month earlier putting output at
but that increase only offset losses in libya angola and venezuela
in other words saudi arabia had of spare capacity at the start of june proceeded to burn through but because of the losses elsewhere the oil market saw no net increase in supply
related asia is leading the renewable energy racenews reports suggest the production increases will continue in july perhaps to as high as
that leaves roughly of remaining spare capacity
but again ongoing losses in libya and venezuela could eat up the means that saudi arabia could use up of the spare capacity that it had without the market really feeling the extra supply
and that is before we get to the potential outages in iran
if all of the of iranian exports are shut in it would theoretically add to the price of oil according to bank of america merrill an extremely problematic scenario it could be the case that saudi arabia does not have the of extra supply that it says it does
or perhaps that capacity is not immediately available
some analysts have argued that it would require additional drilling to push output as high as and it could only take place over many months
ultimately that would mean saudi arabia would be unable to plug the hole leftover by iran and oil prices would likely everyone is that pessimistic however
barclays argues that global spare capacity could actually be about to higher than is commonly thought
the investment bank acknowledged that the deteriorating situation in libya combined with the potential catastrophic losses in iran puts the oil market in a bind
however these eventualities are not completely certain
in the meantime we believe that the market is less focused on some of the weakening demand indicators and stronger supplies that are signaling a softer market balance thus we maintain our bearish view in the short term the investment bank wrote in a note
barclays estimates an average brent price of just per barrel in the second half of and in
related the critical chokepoint that could send oil to crucial difference between a lot of bullish forecasts and the one that barclays envisions is that barclays believes the oil market will remain in a net surplus
the bank conceded that severe outages in iran would blow up that scenario but argued that the us government will quickly find it politically unpalatable in an election year to quickly reduce to zero iranian exports to india and plus the bank says after factoring in from the idled neutral zone on the border which could restart next year in addition to some other surplus capacity in the uae russia and saudi arabia total global spare capacity could be higher than the eia has top it off government inventories could be drawn down
barclays says that in theory governments could add a whopping of supply onto the market for a period of days which would only use up about half of the overall stockpiles they are sitting on
obviously that is an unlikely scenario but the investment bank says it illustrates the quantity of oil that could be called upon in a is somewhat of an outlier in its restrained price forecast
needless to say there is quite a bit of disagreement over the true extent of saudi spare capacity
but we may finally gain some insight into saudi arabia s maximum capabilities if iran really starts to see supplies shut nick cunningham of top reads from
