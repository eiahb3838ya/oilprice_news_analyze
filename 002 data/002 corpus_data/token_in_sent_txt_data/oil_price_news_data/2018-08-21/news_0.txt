spending boost fails to raise production in the permian
the shale industry is gearing up to spend more this year despite assurances to maintain capital the second quarter shale companies signaled their intention to lift capex
part of the reason is that costs are on the rise so some drillers have to spend more to produce the same amount of oil and gas
that was an unexpected development and one that shareholders are not happy survey of shale companies by rystad energy found that while the group revised up spending by about percent they only increased their expected production levels for this year by percent
this disconnect might suggest that the shale industry requires more capital than before to achieve healthy production growth rystad said in a new are some signs that the permian for instance is running into some productivity problems raising the possibility that the highly touted efficiency gains over the past few years are reaching their the other hand the industry is also spending more because they have plans to increase drilling activity which could lead to higher output next year
w hile a part of increased spending is due to service cost inflation a significant part of the incremental budget is also planned to be used for additional drilling throughout to support more intensive completion activity and production growth in rystad energy said in its report
related venezuela takes unprecedented action to stabilize currencythe largest spending increase came from companies focused on the permian basin which is not surprising given both the frenzied pace of drilling in west texas as well as the reports that the basin is suffering from bouts of cost inflation
occidental petroleum stood out from the bunch with an announced increase in spending by million
occidental said it was going to deploy two additional rigs as well as facilities for activity rystad says supporting higher production in the short to medium pioneer natural resources was another notable upward revision in spending from the second quarter
the shale company hiked spending guidance by million with a plan to add four more rigs for
the higher spending is also the result of a plan to increase completion activity plus cost it wasn t just the permian that is attracting higher levels of spending
anadarko petroleum said it would hike capex by million across the dj basin and the permian
anadarko cited cost inflation longer laterals and higher activity
meanwhile the bakken and continental resources increased spending by million for higher completion levels and additional so much additional spending pouring into the shale patch one would think that the industry would revise up its expected volumes of oil and gas
but collectively the group is only expecting to produce an additional small companies reported the largest jump in output including jagged peak energy percent matador resources percent and qep resources percent
their success is the result of greater than planned performance of wells underpinned by continued increase in drilling and completion efficiency rystad energy concluded
they are also growing from a relatively small upward revisions were offset by the disappointing results from a handful of other companies
resolute energy rounded out the bottom of the survey revising down expected production by percent due to less than expected oil content from its wells so far this year
noble energy revised its forecasted production down by percent as it decided to defer completion on some of its drilled wells the result of industry constraints in the the weakest eia report in yearsnotably however none of the permian operators reported a planned decrease in completion activity in the basin this year rystad cost inflation is playing a pivotal role in driving up spending budgets but rystad cautioned not to take that conclusion too far
much of the spending increase is also laying the groundwork for higher production down the road
while higher cost inflation played a role in the uptick in investment budgets as evident from earnings reports the majority of incremental capital expenditure is still planned to be directed to a larger number of intensive completions and facility rystad reason that the revisions to the guidance for look so unimpressive is that these investments may only result in production increases next year
that approach makes sense given that pipeline constraints in the permian won t be resolved until late next year
a lot of companies are doing the upfront work on drilling but deferring completions until when new pipelines come online and midland differentials rise
in other words shareholders may groan at some of the figures that came out of second quarter earnings reports but most shale executives expect things to improve next nick cunningham of top reads from
