the saudi pif holds a percent stake in sabic which would mean that aramco would need to finance the rest from its own reserves which are an estimated billion
the statements come just shortly after aramco s ceo amin nasser reiterated that his company is still committed to the is still not clear when the financing is going to take place but financial sources expect that it will be end of or beginning of
saudi sources have stated that no banks have been mandated for the financial package deal even though banks jp morgan and morgan stanley have been asked to advise on the acquisition

international interest is already growing but could be given a boost by the new deal
it remains unclear how far aramco will be able to put an international bond sale in place as such a deal would require a credit rating and necessitate the disclosure of financial information in a prospectus

hence the eagerness by aramco and its stakeholders aka the royal family to approach the deal as a normal bank loan for international banks the billion loan might not be very tempting as aramco could be pricing its debt on a par with the government demanding reality however is sure to be different

not only will the acquisition form a giant integrated oil company it will also open the posibility of a continuation of the ipo saga
the decision to change the first ipo plan to a downstream aramco ipo is a real possibility presenting no real issues to aramco with regards to transparency or reserve time is right for a debt deal as the attractiveness of saudi arabia is increasing along with oil prices
in september the saudi swf raised billion at the same pricing point as the kingdom s sovereign debt
after the inclusion into the ftse and msci emerging markets index jp morgan has also considered including the kingdom on in its very own jp morgan bond index
this fund is slated to bring another influx of cash to the kingdom of around billion

without taking the goose with the golden eggs to the market aramco his strategy to attract investment interest in the kingdom is already bringing rewards
a possible aramco sabic ipo will be yet another vicrtory for saudi arabia without the downsides involved in the orignal ipo cyril widdershoven for top reads from
