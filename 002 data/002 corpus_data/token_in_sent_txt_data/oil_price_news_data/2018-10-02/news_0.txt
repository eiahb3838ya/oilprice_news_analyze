wti discount to brent could explode
the world s two most important oil benchmarks are on two different tracks and may see a larger divergence in the months has typically traded at a discount to brent although the differential widens and narrows depending on specific dynamics affecting the two benchmarks
back in when the shale bonanza really began to explode the midstream sector was for such a dramatic ramp up
the result was a bottleneck that forced wti to trade at a discount in excess of per barrel for a short period of time
new pipelines resolved the backlog and the discount narrowed in the ensuing however surging production in the permian has resulted in yet another midstream bottleneck
as a result the wti discount has bounced around between and per barrel relative to brent
in september the differential jumped to

shale output continues to grow albeit at a slower pace than in months past
permian takeaway capacity is all but tapped out which could result in localized glut of supply
oil located in midland texas in the heart of the permian has already been trading at a discount to wti in houston and that dynamic will only magnify as we head into brent which more closely reflects the international market is suffering from the opposite problem
as iranian supply continues to plunge iranian oil exports are down some million barrels per day from the april peak the global oil market has tightened to its greatest extent since
now there are questions about saudi arabia s spare capacity and its ability to offset the outages in result is that wti and brent are on diverging paths which could widen the differential to as much as per barrel according to citigroup roughly twice as high as today
as permian production continues to grind higher more oil could end up in storage in cushing
as inventories climb wti will suffer downward pressure

it s bottlenecked getting to the gulf coast but it s not as bottlenecked getting into that could result in the widest discount in about five years
we expect that permian production is going to continue to grow morse said
we have production from colorado to oklahoma even from north dakota and canada that has to go to cushing before getting to the gulf a differential as large as per barrel would have knock on effects
it would supercharge the business case for new pipelines coming out of the permian although some analysts think that the midstream market in texas is getting pretty crowded with several pipelines under construction
such a heavy discount could also incrementally slow drilling in the shale patch
at the same time new modes of transit could open up with an expansion of trucks and rail moving oil from west texas to the gulf coast although trucks and rail are also facing their own constraints more obvious effect of a discount for wti would be an acceleration of crude oil exports
crude discounted by that much would be very attractive to buyers around the world so exports would likely rise even higher than today s levels
if wti were discounted by per barrel relative to brent the limiting factor for exports would be inadequate export infrastructure not willing buyers
related how much spare capacity does saudi arabia really have gulf coast refiners would also enjoy buying up crude and churning out gasoline and diesel which they could export at much higher prices that are more closely linked with brent
even better refiners inland would have a better chance of buying the heavily discounted oil trapped behind the pipeline
wti may be discounted to brent by per barrel but midland crude would be discounted by at least as much relative to wti in houston
the result would be a windfall for this is a temporary story
there are several reasons why the discount would not last long
the biggest and most obvious reason is that the permian pipeline bottleneck is expected to be fleeting
by late next year new capacity will start coming online to ease the backlog
that will allow more oil to reach the gulf coast either for refining or for export narrowing the price second reason would be that a surge in exports would help force wti and brent back together although the degree to which this matters is up for debate
more crude oil exports will help even out the imbalances in what are essentially different markets for crude oil just as any arbitrage eventually nick cunningham of top reads from
