is china turning trump's oil weapon against him?
usually when referring to the oil weapon analysts are talking about the decades old policy of major oil producing nations withholding production to tighten supplies and drive prices up often driven by geopolitical most nefarious example of this came in when middle eastern producers led by saudi arabia cut oil imports to the and a number of western countries
two other embargoes took place in both and with less than stellar results
their objective especially in and was to force countries that supported israel to change their foreign policies and to also put pressure on israel to withdraw from the territories it occupied during the war often called the six day appears to have faded from public memory is that the has used the oil weapon more than opec producers including oil embargoes on japan before world war ii then on the soviet union in the and in various forms on south africa burma serbia haiti libya iraq iran and sudan over the last twenty years or oil embargoes including the most remembered and politically and economically explosive embargo of seldom work
after the embargo the japan and several european nations that had suffered then record high oil and gasoline prices and a supply shock fought back enacting fuel efficiency standards the establishment of strategic petroleum reserves and other measures that swung marginal power back to oil importing nations but more importantly reduced global oil demand for decades in essence causing the embargo to weapon possibility now a of this strategy but this time by an oil consumer that could be trimming imports for political reasons might be week citing people familiar with the matter reuters said that chinese oil major sinopec the country s top refiner was going to cut its iranian oil imports by half this month after coming under intense pressure from washington to comply with the ban on iranian oil which kicks in on november sources didn t specify volumes but based on the prevailing supply contract between sinopec and the national iranian oil company nioc sinopec will reduce its loadings to about barrels per day bpd equaling percent of china s daily average imports from iran in the deepest chinese cut in iranian oil exports in years
related europe prepares for natural gas price hikewhile most analysts including the reuters report claim that beijing is ceding to pressure over iranian oil imports another motive may be lurking in the china trims its iranian crude imports it will have a effect of exacerbating the prevailing supply worry for global oil markets as well as the distinct possibility of a supply crunch going as more iranian barrels are removed upward pressure on global oil prices will persist with the likelihood that the global oil price bench mark london traded brent crude will breach the price point before the end of year
some analysts are calling for prices around per barrel but it s still too early to see if that will beijing locked in a bitter trade war with washington that is already hurting economic growth and with the knowledge that high oil and gasoline prices will sway voters in the upcoming congressional elections beijing could be playing the oil card so republicans lose their slim two seat lead in the a majority in the senate much of trump s policies thus far including his hawkish view with china over trade as well as other issues will be in jeopardy
the senate is currently composed of republicans democrats and independents both of whom caucus with the democrats related the middle east nuclear race is reaching a boiling pointfrom beijing s perspective any set back to trump s trade war would be a win both abroad and at home
however if the republican party retains control of the senate it s likely that trump will impose tariffs on all remaining chinese imports to the leaving beijing exposed both economically and s accusationsthe white house has already claimed that china is trying to influence american voters by leveling sanctions against industries and states that support his candidacy
last week during his much criticized speech to the un trump upped the ante even more stating that china did not want me or us the republican party to win because i am the first president ever to challenge china on and we are winning on trade
we are winning on every level he tim daiss for top reads from
