the texas oil boom isnâ€™t creating enough jobs
texas is witnessing a fresh oil boom with june production hitting million bpd all thanks to two things efficiency improvements and of course oil prices
but not everyone is happy about this
the higher efficiency means that fewer new jobs are is one of the takeaways from the latest texas petro index from the texas alliance of energy producers as presented by oil economist karr production over the months to june ingham said rose by an impressive percent and while not a priority for drillers in the state natural gas production has also increased
yet it is taking fewer rigs to pump more oil and also fewer oil price collapse of forced producers to bet on efficiency on doing more with less and now they are reaping the fruits of their labor they have learned how to boost production from one single well without adding more rigs
they have also learned to make longer horizontal part of the well in the shale they have learned to pump more sand and chemicals into these has led to lower demand for workers as reflected in the texas petro index
as of june the number of direct upstream jobs in the texas oil industry totaled
some new jobs were added after the crisis which had wiped out as many as jobs
although job creation will continue in the second half of the year chances are it will continue at the same slow pace compared with production the not so good news about oil jobs texas continues to reign supreme in oil and gas as of june the lone star state produced percent of the nation s total oil output and percent of its natural gas output
more than half of active drilling rigs in the united states are in texas and almost percent of direct upstream jobs are there too
related coke meth and booze the flip side of the permian oil boomdrilling permits are down from last year but well completions are up and considerably by percent
the value of oil produced is also substantially higher thanks to the improvement in international prices
however texas drillers have their woes as well and price is one of problem stems from a pipeline shortage in the permian that has forced local drillers to sell their crude at a discount to get it to discount that saw midland crude trade us a barrel lower than brent the international benchmark
this pipeline shortage was a result of the quick expansion of production in the prolific basin after the permian which produced the bulk of texas oil output at million bpd in june has some of the acreage which spurred an oil rush there over the last three years
the rush is paying off in terms of production as evidenced by the latest texas alliance figures but both the pipeline shortage and the slow job growth continue to hang over the irina slav for top reads from
