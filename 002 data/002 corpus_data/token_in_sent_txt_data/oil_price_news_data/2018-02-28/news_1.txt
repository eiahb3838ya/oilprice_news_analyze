should opec and u.s. shale collaborate for survival?
oil and gas is a trillion dollar industry and every actor within it be it national oil companies multinationals independents or oilfield services companies has a stake in oil and gas flourishing
and now these players face an existential question how will the industry react to new challenges in the shape of electric vehicles and renewables not long ago technological advancements led to the rise of shale
a significant increase in shale oil and shale gas production not only allowed the united states to reduce its oil import dependency but also influenced international oil prices
this may be good news from a consumer perspective but it was detrimental for most major oil producers particularly opec prices have fallen significantly since because of a myriad of factors including a significant increase in shale oil and gas production
first opec believed it could challenge this emerging enemy by ramping up oil production in order to bankrupt shale drillers
however to opec s surprise events did not materialize as quickly as anticipated
eventually after a lag of months there was a plunge in shale output
nevertheless the lower oil prices also severely affected the economies of major oil producing countries which heavily rely on oil revenues in some cases oil contributes over percent of their total export revenues
thus most of these countries were looking for higher average oil prices in order to meet their national budgets and to realize their respective visions
a vision that requires huge consistent cash opec turned to old practices cutting oil production in an effort to revive oil prices
a strong compliance has led to a drop in oecd inventories from million barrels a year ago to million barrels in early
consequently in last couple of months oil prices have been fluctuating in has taught us that nothing lasts forever
we have seen the dominance of coal that was once responsible for industrial revolution its role is diminishing not only due to the availability of new resources but also due to environmental and economic considerations
the increasing role of oil demand in transport sector was only possible due to perfection of the internal combustion engine that revolutionized the in dominance of autoindustry for over a century allowed oil demand to thrive as the global transportation sector accounts for percent of global oil demand road air rail sea
as such oil demand has substantially increased over time and reached million barrels per day mmbpd in
related trump s gas tax hike could make californian fuel cheaperbased on the historical trend population growth and economic outlook most of the international agencies and consultants were of the view that oil demand would reach mmbpd by
however as the automotive industry becomes more incentivized to build electric vehicles evs this is evs won t replace all ices overnight
that transformation would require over decades
therefore no one is claiming that oil demand in road transportation in particular will be wiped out suddenly
a speedy penetration of evs however could lead to a significant slowdown in oil demand
in i wrote a paper will opec use this strategy to defeat shale the analysis concluded that the shale oil industry is insensitive to changes in oil prices in the but will strengthen in the longer oil prices increase shale oil production increases and generally recovers the lost share in production but also surpasses its earlier respective peaks
the analysis in the abovementioned article could provide some critical answers to opec offering some clues on how the cartel could defend its market share
one strategy may be to flip flop oil production in order to navigate in oil prices although this may run counter to their fundamental policy
for example opec members could freeze oil production or even decrease production and allow oil prices to gradually increase between to for to months lag to respond by shale oil industry and then increase their production for to months to lower oil prices back down to to dampen the revival of shale oil production
this flip flop strategy of production will allow opec to fetch an average of higher oil prices compared to their strategy of solely defending market share while at the same time also keep the shale oil revival in check
in however not even this policy will work due to the significant increase in drilled but uncompleted wells duc
for example the number of duc s increased from in december to in january
this gave the shale oil industry a greater flexibility to respond promptly when wining goals collusioninstead of going it alone opec may decide to collaborate with the shale oil industry
in this partnership both parties have to agree to some degree as to how much to produce in order to achieve some reasonable annual average oil prices say between to or even more
in theory this partnership could work but many independent oil producers might not see the need to another problem is how to determine production quotas especially for shale oil producers
it is already difficult enough to control production quota among the few opec members
how can one expect oil majors and independent shale oil producers to adhere to certain output quota
if such a strategy could somehow be realized but parties could be trump s gas tax hike could make californian fuel cheapernevertheless this policy has its own negative implications
higher oil prices may speed up the penetration of evs as they will encourage the autoindustry find ways to bring the production costs of evs strategies new business structureinstead of collusion the industry should realize the facts and act accordingly
the senior executives of the major oil and gas companies know the fate of the oil industry very well even though they avoid acknowledging it publically
the shrewd executives are already in the process of developing alternative strategies to remain in the business maybe with a different structure
eventually executives of nocs should also realize that continued dependency on oil revenue alone could be and may hold them back from their respective national visions
the oil industry has to develop alternative business models to diversify oil based economies sooner rather than later
