u.s. looks to dethrone russia as top oil producer
just a few years ago hardly anyone expected that that the would be competing with the world s top oil producers for the number thanks to the shale resurgence here we the past few weeks american crude oil production outstripped that of saudi arabia opec s de facto leader and biggest the is on track to dethrone in the coming months the world s current leader in oil production the second shale boom came in the wake of the production cut deal masterminded and led by opec s saudi arabia and s russia
as opec and its allies have been withholding a total of million bpd production over the past year oil prices have increased thanks to the overhang drawdown on the back of restricted supply and global demand growth amid robust economic growth in basically all regions of the for the brief hiccup two weeks ago wti prices have held above a barrel since the start of
and shale production is booming and on course to crown america as the world s top oil producer as early as later this will become the world s largest crude oil producer by at the latest fatih birol the executive director of the international energy agency iea said this week
the will overtake russia as the world s largest oil producer definitely next year if not as early as this year he the united states will become the oil producer sometime very soon birol told reuters reiterating the iea s estimate from its latest monthly oil market report published earlier in us crude output up will soon overtake saudi arabia and could catch russia by the end of the year the iea said two weeks all the indicators that suggest continued fast growth in the us are in perfect alignment rising prices leading after a few months to more drilling more completions more production and more hedging the iea said warning that the surge in by the tip the oil market into deeper oversupply should opec and shale collaborate for survival
forecasts also suggest that the american oil production will beat both saudi arabia and russia this year assuming that the deal remains intact until the end of as currently energy information administration eia expects in its latest energy outlook that production will average million bpd this year
this is higher than saudi arabia s current production of just below million
production will average million bpd in the eia said earlier this month
this is higher than russia s current production of just below million bpd as moscow is cutting production as part of the far in february crude oil production has topped million bpd in each of the three previous weeks eia data only is the boosting oil production but it is also increasing its oil exports including to the prized asian market on which saudi arabia and russia have been competing for market share
higher oil to china and a historic first to the middle upending the global oil flows and eating away at the market shares of saudi arabia and opec and its allies seem unfazed by shale and continue to send messages to the market that they will do whatever it takes to balance the oil inventories and that production cuts are here to stay until the end of s most influential minister saudi arabia s energy minister khalid said over the weekend that easing of the production cuts would start sometime in but we don t know when and we don t know how said confirming that he wants a permanent super group of opec and producers in a market monitoring fashion that allows us to take quick opec and its partners are set to review the deal in june and take stock of the pace of the market rebalancing
with soaring production threatening to undo a large part of their cuts the cartel and allies may have to consider if the time has come for them to start defending their market share or if they should stick to the cuts in the name of higher oil prices in order to get more oil revenues in budgets and boost the valuation of saudi aramco for the ipo currently planned for the second half of tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
