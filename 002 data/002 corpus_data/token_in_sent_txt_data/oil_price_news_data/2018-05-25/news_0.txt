u.s. shale production may be plateauing
i have updated my scenarios for lto output based on both eia tight oil output data and average well profile data from enno peters
i have also created a scenario for the niobrara shale oil play and for other lto which excludes the permian basin lto eagle ford north dakota forks and the niobrara

the oil price scenario below is used for all of the scenarios

the scenario below assumes eur starts to decrease in jan as sweet spots become fully drilled
economically recoverable resources err to are gb with total oil wells completed peak output is in early opec may ease oil cuts as soon as junefewer wells are completed relative to the north dakota bakken and permian basin because the wells are less profitable
click to enlarge other ltofor other lto much of the output is from condensate from gas wells so the analysis is more approximate and a discounted cash flow analysis is beyond the scope of this post the average well produces only about kb over its life but in many cases the output of natural gas makes the well profitable there are some areas where does not have data such as the anadarko basin so i have simply taken the average well profile for areas covered excluding nd bakken eagle ford permian and niobrara and then found the number of these average wells that fit other lto output data from the eia including anadarko
the true average well profile for all areas including anadarko is scenario below should be considered very preliminary actual output might be much higher or lower than suggested by this scenario
trr is gb from wells completed and peak output is in
for comparison other lto output was in feb so increased output from other lto plays may be quite small in magnitude
click to enlarge north dakota bakken scenario click to enlarge eagle ford scenario click to enlarge the roi for eagle ford wells is much lower than permian or bakken wells which accounts for wells added per month remaining far below the peak level gb with total wells completed in jan output is
like the nd bakken and permian scenarios it is assumed for the eagle ford that new well eur starts to decrease in jan basin ltoerr is gb through with wells completed peak is in

click to enlarge the scenario presented above lines up with the usgs mean estimates for the permian basin and north dakota bakken and david hughes most likely scenario for the eagle ford in terms of urr
reasonable guesses for the niobrara and other lto were made based on eia tight output data and well data from and these will be updated as more information becomes available
higher or lower scenarios could be created with urr from to gb and peak years between and and peak output between and
in my view lto has about an probability of falling within the low and high scenarios outlined top reads from
