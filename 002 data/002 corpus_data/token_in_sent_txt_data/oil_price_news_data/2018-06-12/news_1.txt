saudis lift oil production to 10 million bpd
saudi arabia pumped over bpd of crude oil more in may with daily production reaching million bpd officials from the country s oil industry said as quoted by the oil and gas journal adding that plans are to add a further bpd this news comes on the heels of russian media reports that the country s oil production recovered to million barrels

related can saudi arabia prevent the next oil shock there are already a lot of signs pointing towards a tough june meeting with russia and saudi arabia clearly in favor of higher production and iraq and iran clearly opposed to it
iraq is not really in a good position to oppose the raise however
opec s never complied with its cut quota of bpd
in fact estimates by platts show iraq has exceeded its ceiling by the most within some bpd since the start of the deal with compliance at just upcoming meeting is shaping up as a tough one as some analysts have already warned
when opec agreed to cuts some members notably iraq took quite a lot of convincing that it was necessary to start cutting and it looks like now they will need equally intensive convincing that it s time to stop irina slav for top reads from
