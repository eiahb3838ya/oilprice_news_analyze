is this the most contentious opec meeting yet?
both saudi arabia and russia recently increased their oil production levels an indication that they are getting a head start on higher output even as possible changes to the agreement remain up in the is growing discord from within opec with iraq joining a group of those opposed to higher output levels
iraq s oil minister said that the objective of the cuts has not yet been achieved and that iraq rejects unilateral decisions made by some producers which do not consult with the those comments come after venezuela and iran formerly requested solidarity against sanctions and lobbed angry statements at saudi arabia for seeming to comply with requests for higher oil solidifying opposition among a solid portion of opec against higher output comes even as saudi arabia ratcheted up production by somewhere between and bpd in may likely taking output back above million barrels per day
russia also boosted production by more than bpd in early june
because the top two oil producers are already starting to increase output and they are pretty much the only ones in favor of increasing production the opec meeting is shaping up to be highly oil market is assuming some level of increase at the upcoming meeting which is why prices have fallen back from recent highs and have remain subdued
but higher opec production does not necessarily mean a market nor does it mean that price stability will stick is one major factor that the market seems to be overlooking
any increase in production will come at the expense of the already limited spare capacity
saudi arabia holds the bulk of global spare capacity which can be defined as a volume of oil that can be called upon at short notice and then sustained for a period of time
deploying that surplus while adding supplies to the market will cut into the to reuters and data from bank jeffries if saudi arabia and russia hike production global spare capacity would shrink from the current percent of global demand down to just percent
that margin would be the lowest in more than three decades
you would essentially be taking million barrels per day bpd of spare capacity down to approximately million bpd jefferies analyst jason gammel said according to reuters
related oil markets unmoved by north korea summitsome other analysts say the cushion could be even smaller
the eia said that opec s spare capacity was only at in the first quarter of a figure that is assumed to decline over the next year and a half
if saudi arabia ramps up output to say as it was before the onset of the agreement at the start of that would shrink the size of spare capacity siting on the sidelines by a significant bpd or so

saudi oil minister khalid said as much last month in an interview with reuters
we are concerned about tight spare capacity nowadays he until recently the massive volume of oil sitting in inventories has acted as a form of spare capacity
that surplus has been well above average levels since and it has taken an extended period of time to use up that excess
but we have arrived at that point the production cuts have eliminated the inventory surplus and inventories could draw down for the rest of this year if the coalition doesn t increase is why saudi arabia and russia are on the verge of adding supply back into the market
but with the inventory surplus gone spare capacity now moves front and center
higher production will directly cut into some of the few sources of supply that can be called upon at a moment s notice
related permian boom jeopardized by pipeline troubles so were they to raise by million bpd then million bpd is left scraping the low end of the range historically and uncomfortably tight given the high and rising geopolitical disruption risk robert mcnally of the rapidan energy group told the past whenever spare capacity ran low it coincided with periods in which oil prices were high and extremely volatile such as in when prices broke unexpected outage would have an outsized impact on the market because producers would have even more trouble replacing missing barrels
that means that a pipeline explosion in nigeria or libya for instance could send prices skyward
unexpectedly sharp declines in venezuela worse than the market is already taking into account would have a similar effect
disruptions to iranian supply are also arabia claims it can produce or perhaps even more but analysts question those figures
because saudi aramco s operations are a closely held state secret nobody really knows
if riyadh decides to boost output and run down spare capacity their capabilities might be put to the test over the next year if there is a major unexpected outage
the oil market would be in for a wild nick cunningham of top reads from
