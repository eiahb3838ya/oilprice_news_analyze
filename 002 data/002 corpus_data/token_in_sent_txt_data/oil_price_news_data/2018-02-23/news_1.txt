peak u.s. shale could be 4 years away
shale production growth has outperformed even the most bullish forecasts forcing opec and the international energy agency iea to revise up american supply growth projections month after energy information administration eia also expects oil to continue to grow in all possible modeled scenarios for the next four years according to its annual energy outlook published this the eia is not predicting what will happen it is modeling possible production scenarios under certain assumptions
under one of those modeled low oil and gas resource and technology assumptions applied are lower resources and higher costs
in this model tight oil the plays eagle ford woodford austin chalk spraberry niobrara springs and expected to rise from million bpd in to million bpd in and then to start declining on a steady downward trend by when tight oil production is expected to be at million is one of the side cases in eia s models and one of the most unlikely because it assumes no technological breakthroughs lower resources and higher costs
under this model total crude oil production is pegged at million bpd this year while figures are currently available showing that production is already above million bpd and likely to average more than million bpd this year
the reference case scenario shows tight oil production jumping to more than million bpd by and surpassing million bpd in before starting to level off some time in the early
total crude oil production in the reference case is between million bpd and million bpd by as tight oil development moves into less productive areas and as well productivity declines the eia projections are much more uncertain than forecasts and oil production will depend on many prices the pace of technological advances costs well productivity and and global oil demand growth to name a tech giants scramble to secure cobalt supplymoreover the pace of the booming shale production over the next five years will also be determined by several factors that could limit the supply growth potential which the eia has not accounted for in its modeling energy expert robert rapier writes on forbes
these are midstream infrastructure constraints the flaring of associated natural gas that has limits imposed cost inflation and shortage of fracking service providers that could potentially slow down growth over the next few years and could shift the timing of peak tight oil rapier agrees that shale will grow in the near opec which admitted in its world oil outlook that tight oil will grow at least until as drillers seek out and aggressively produce barrels from sweet spots in the permian and other opec sees tight oil peaking in the latter half of the the shale growth rate will depend on how fast pipeline infrastructure can keep up with increased companies will continue to pour billions of dollars into takeaway capacity infrastructure in the permian with each project worth around us billion for a total of tens of billions of dollars aaron blomquist managing director investment banking with tudor pickering holt told midland in an interview at the end of question is whether the rise in takeaway capacity will catch up with the surge in
shale growth will also hinge on how fast labor shortages or shortages of frac sand could be addition growth will depend on whether could soon start to test the permian region s geological be able to overcome the geological constraints with tech breakthroughs
if drillers can t overcome the law of physics with technology permian production could peak in putting more than million bpd of future production in question and potentially significantly influencing oil prices wood mackenzie has oil prices diverge on mixed datathe pace of shale growth will also be determined by the shift in investor sentiment toward drillers that gained momentum in the second half of
oil tycoon harold hamm issued a warning that producers won t succeed if they drill themselves into oblivion
now there is a shift from grow at all costs to make some profits for a change and companies are more focused on cash flow investors really want companies to generate good economics which for the most part means living within your means spending cash flow or below cash flow and using any free cash flow to do something good for the shareholders whether it s pay off debt buy back shares or even pay a dividend robert watson chief executive at san abraxas petroleum corporation told north american shale magazine s patrick miller earlier this is no doubt that shale production will grow over the next three to four years
but there are many economic geological technological corporate finance and infrastructure factors that will set the pace for that growth both in the short term and in the long tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
