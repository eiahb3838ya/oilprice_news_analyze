opec ‘supergroup’ keeps oil exports subdued
i was jesting the other day about who would be on guitar in opec supergroup but it got me thinking about the various global oil producers and how their traits could be reflective of their musicianship
this is where it led me if opec nopec were a supergroup saudi arabia would have to be the band manager the leader keeping everyone else in check
the kingdom would also as the tour bus driver given they are the ones driving the rest of the group
if saudi is the manager russia must be the lead singer stepping into the spotlight and up to the mic
unlike roadies the minnows of opec nopec everyone listens to the singer
as the chart below illustrates russia has been remarkably successful at dialing back its exports particularly in the second half of last year with the likes of rosneft lukoil and gazprom being into compliance
russian crude exports spent averaging bpd below october reference level signaling compliance by our calculations
click to enlarge with russia as our vocalist angola and kuwait would be the rhythm section a measured and solid basis for the band
kuwait would be the drummer upbeat and on point while angola would be the bass player steady and reliable as has been their discussed last month how our clipperdata show that angola has been in compliance by exporting million fewer barrels last year versus its october reference the chart below illustrates the west african nation has continued to keep its leading destination china well supplied delivering percent of its exports there servicing its obligations
the was the destination for angolan crude last year but a long long looooong way back in second accounting for less than percent of total deliveries
back to our supergroup we still need someone on the axe
libya is perhaps the best fit for lead guitar given the ability of its choppy exports to rise and fall like eric clapton shredding a fretboard
related what s really happening with venezuela s el petro after averaging just bpd in exports of el sharara and es sider ramped up emphatically in averaging a whopping el sharara field libya largest was closed in november before ramping back up again in late
flows of es sider were briefly taken offline in late december amid the waha pipeline explosion but as the chart below illustrates exports from the es sider terminal rebounded soon enough as the pipeline was quickly repaired
exports of both es sider and el sharara have started by riffing higher averaging over bpd in january accounting for over a half of total crude exports
as domestic production rises total libyan exports are now up to their highest level since
rock n roll
