asia set to lose 3 million bpd of oil production
oil production in southeast asia and east asia will decline by percent between and according to a new report from rystad depletion from mature oil fields will significantly erode oil production in the region and new projects will not be able to makeup for the decline
rystad energy expects total oil production in southeast asia and east asia to decline to million barrels of oil equivalent per day by down from million in production from china rystad energy predicts will decline by the least supported by the stable output from the giant changqing field and several ramping up projects including longmaxi the predications show the changqing field contributing more than million over the next five years
click to enlarge but production in southeast asia doesn t fare as well with output dropping sharply
rystad cited the example of the exxonmobil led banyu urip project in indonesia and shell s deepwater project in malaysia both of which to peak and decline over the forecast the decline in output from mature fields is the dwindling volume of new oil and gas discovered over the past decade and a half
in fact since the broader oil market downturn began in discoveries in east and southeast asia have plunged
in the worst year for discoveries only about million boe in reserves were discovered down from over billion boe in and billion boe in
fewer discoveries will mean fewer and fewer new sources of supply coming online in the years importantly even the limited volume of oil that was discovered recently may not necessarily translate into production
most of the recent key discoveries rystad said in its report are still related the oil industry sets its sights on asiaeven as china doesn t suffer as much as some of its regional neighbors output has still declined quite a bit in recent years
the iea sees china producing an average of million barrels per day in down by since
much of china s output comes from mature oil fields and requires hefty levels of investment to keep output from falling
the market downturn that began in forced china s main oil companies to scale back spending and ultimately the companies shelved some production that was no longer from the region has been declining since and rystad energy predicts that the losses will continue for the rest of the decade
current discoveries waiting in the pipeline to be developed are not enough to offset the declining trend in the in a global context southeast and east asia amount to a major bullish force on the oil market not only because supply is falling but also because demand is soaring
by all accounts asia will represent a large slice of future oil demand growth going forward
just a few days ago bp published its annual energy outlook in which it predicted that china and india alone would make up half of total global energy demand growth over the next three decades
related what is the right price for oil in a balanced market that stands in sharp contrast to say north america where supply is growing significantly and demand is expected to be flat at best over the next decade or trends likely mean that the shipment of crude oil that just left the newly revamped louisiana offshore oil port loop and appears to be heading for china will be increasingly common in the years is retooling other ports such as the one at corpus christi tx to also handle very large crude carriers vlccs
china emerged as a top buyer of crude last year a relationship that should grow going forward
that is especially true since oil production in asia is nick cunningham of top reads from
