offshore rig builders face new reality
last week total announced that it was deploying the first offshore robots at a north sea platform to test them as maintenance tools
earlier shell inked a contract with an engineering firm to find ways of extending the life of its leman alpha offshore platform
borr drilling said this month that its acquisition of sector player paragon offshore should be completed by the end of these three stories have in common is their goal cost reduction
cost reduction has become a leitmotif in the oil industry after and there is one segment that is feeling the pinch particularly strongly offshore drillers and platform builders
as oil and gas producers tighten spending and look for smaller less projects rig builders and operators are finding themselves forced to undergo their own a recent story reuters nerijus adomaitis wrote about the deployment of the giant aasta hansteen platform built by kvaerner for statoil noting that it will likely be the last of its kind as its to smaller cheaper more flexible rigs and seeks to extend the lives of existing s bad news for kvaerner aker solutions and their sector players because is the biggest revenue source for the offshore industry
the news is not as bad as it would have been if was the only revenue source for the industry
just two months ago kvaerner landed a contract with statoil for the construction of the topside for the norwegian company s fpso installation at the giant johan castberg field
the money is not the same but this is how it s going to be from now a report released last thursday wood mackenzie analysts said the oil and gas industry is increasingly favoring brownfield projects and expansion on more subsea instead of tapping new fields
the reason for this shift in approach is still the same frugality and the search for quicker returns
the difference from previous cycles is that this time there is a very good chance that spending will not rebound to previous levels as renewable alternatives start breathing down the oil industry s neck
related permian bottleneck could impact global oil marketsso what s a platform builder to do
leaving aside platform life extension and the construction of other offshore facilities decommissioning is one market niche that will expand in the coming years in the north sea
the decommissioning report of oil and gas uk estimated that between that year and the decommissioning market will represent a us pound decommissioning maintenance and building smaller platforms there is always the renewables industry
kvaerner and local peer aker solutions are both already active in renewables wind power more specifically
a third sector player subsea is also increasing its activity in wind power makes sense for offshore field service and equipment providers
they have the expertise and the experience in making offshore installations and they just need to apply it to wind mills instead of platforms
the just might be harder than it seems but not too hard judging by the shift
offshore service providers will survive transforming along with the industry that has been their only source of income until irina slav for top reads from
