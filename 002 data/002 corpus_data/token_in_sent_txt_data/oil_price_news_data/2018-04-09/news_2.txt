alberta s oil sands producers have been desperate for new outlets to take their oil out of the country and the keystone xl saga is the perfect illustration of the industry s xl is still facing an uncertain future and with several other major oil pipeline projects already shelved there has been extra emphasis on the successful outcome of the trans mountain expansion
that is exactly why canada s federal government including prime minister justin trudeau has gone to bat for the despite federal approval trans mountain still faces a variety of obstacles that have bedeviled the project for some time
it appears that opposition from first nations environmental groups local communities affected by the route and the provincial government in british columbia have forced kinder morgan to throw in the towel at least for morgan said on sunday that it suspended most work on the billion trans mountain groups hailed the announcement

this pipeline will be ableg abpoli keepcanadaworkinghowever kinder morgan actually didn t sound all that optimistic despite heavy support from ottawa and we will be judicious in our use of shareholder funds
in keeping with that commitment we have determined that in the current environment we will not put kml shareholders at risk on the remaining project spend kean said in a statement
kinder morgan canada said the project faces unquantifiable risk noting the threats made by the bc government to kill the project
the company had already spent over c billion preparing the project but hadn t yet commenced construction
the beginning of construction would mean spending would jump to to million per month a level of spending that the company says is too risky given the the fact remains that a substantial portion of the project must be constructed through british columbia and since the change in government in june that government has been clear and public in its intention to use tool in the toolbox to stop the project kinder morgan canada s keane said in a statement

the iea has forecasted that canadian oil production already began to exceed takeaway capacity last year and the pipeline shortage could last for several more years even if trans mountain expansion moves forward
but if trans mountain is killed off that would be nearly bpd of capacity that won t come online
that raises questions about when and if the bottleneck will ever be addressed
that threatens to prevent new capacity from coming online in the years if we can not reach agreement by may it is difficult to conceive of any scenario in which we would proceed with the project kinder morgan canada said in a nick cunningham of top reads from
