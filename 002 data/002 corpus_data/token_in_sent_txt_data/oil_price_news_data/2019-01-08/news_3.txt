woodmac: demand for oil in transportation sector to peak in a decade
global transportation demand for crude oil is expected to peak in the late due to the rise of electric vehicles evs improved efficiency standards for internal combustion engine ice cars and consumer preferences wood mackenzie said in a recent major oil companies and analysts also believe that by the late crude oil demand for transportation fuels will stop growing
as a result major refiners are preparing for a petrochemical future of their crude oil refining processes to replace part of their gasoline diesel and other distillates production after many oil production and refining companies are emphasising chemicals particularly olefins and aromatics as a key target area for future crude oil demand growth wrote steve zinger senior vice president petrochemicals at oil firms including exxonmobil saudi aramco and sabic are developing technologies while many traditional oil refineries will consider retrofitting to maximize production of chemical feedstocks rather than transportation fuels the energy consultancy to recent estimates by the international energy agency iea petrochemicals are expected to account for more than a third of global oil demand growth to and nearly half the growth to adding nearly million bpd by then
petrochemicals will have a greater influence on the future of oil demand than cars trucks and aviation the iea s executive director fatih birol said in october
related has fracking activity peaked already according to a woodmac analysis from a few months ago the ev share of the global car fleet is still miniscule considering that the world s stock of cars is billion units
but battery costs and range are less and less the stumbling blocks in ev adoption
battery is one third of the cost of an ev today
yet costs have already declined by percent this decade and will fall further
battery pack prices will drop below us this year and then fall by around percent each year woodmac said in the critical threshold is us that s when evs will compete on commercial terms with ice vehicles
we think we ll get there by woodmac will displace around million bpd to million bpd of oil demand by percent of total oil demand the consultancy has estimated
