is this the answer to canadaâ€™s oil crisis?
while even the most likely new pipeline to ship more of alberta s crude oil to refining and export s line nearly a year away at the earliest the province hosting most of canada s oil production has been desperately seeking other ways to get more value for its natural is looking to boost the capacity to transport an additional bpd of its oil over the next three years
in the most drastic measure yet the province mandated an oil production cut of bpd for three months starting january to clear the current glut and lift canadian heavy oil is also looking to another solution to alleviate the crude oil a new oil refinery built in the province that would absorb part of the crude and unlock some space on congested pipelines shipping oil out of the however are not convinced that a new refinery would help much to clear the oil glut
first alberta s current refineries already produce more than enough gasoline and diesel to meet local demand
second any excess of fuel has to be moved out of the province too
shipping those products to markets faces similar issues like the current crude oil takeaway capacity bottlenecks
third those refined products would have to compete for a share on a flat or declining north american fuel market where refineries already produce more gasoline and other refined products than america consumes
related army joins race to expand oil exportsshortly after announcing the oil production cut alberta s premier rachel notley said that the government was issuing a request for expression of interest to determine business cases for investing in a new refinery in alberta or tied to alberta production
the alberta government will accept expressions of interest until february and will consider interest in new greenfield investments or an expansion of facilities at an existing brownfield s government didn t specify how it would support the project
yet even if it were to follow up the stage with issuing a request for proposals to construct a new refinery the potential new project would take years to complete and start up building a new refinery would create jobs for albertans
new refining capacity would also help lower the oil price differential over the long term protecting the province from a lack of capacity to export oil and making sure we get full value for the energy resources owned by all albertans the statement seeking industry interest has four operating refineries and a new one starting up any time now
the suncor refinery in edmonton the imperial oil refinery in edmonton the shell canada refinery in scotford and the husky asphalt refinery in lloydminster have a total capacity of bpd while the sturgeon refinery of the north west redwater partnership nwr has started up some units and is set to start commercial production this year
the refinery will have a capacity to process bpd increasing total alberta refinery capacity to bpd
related is iran exaggerating the demand for its oil those refineries already produce more fuels than alberta consumes and any new refinery would have to fight for market access and markets amid more challenging refining economics according to you still have to ship that product to market jason parent vice president of consulting at downstream consultancy kent group ltd told to kevin birn director of north american crude oil markets at ihs markit potential new refineries in alberta in five years time would not help the province s current takeaway capacity constraints with crude by the time you get this facility on you are looking four or five years down the line
if you can t get your egress solved by then you ve got a problem birn told bloomberg
while more refining capacity in alberta could alleviate the crude oil it still exists in four or five could create more fuel oversupply that would need access to markets anyway
what s certain is that a new refinery tomorrow won t ease alberta s crude oil excess tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
