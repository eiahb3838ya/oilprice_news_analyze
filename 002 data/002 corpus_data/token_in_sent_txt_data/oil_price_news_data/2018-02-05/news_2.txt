u.s. considers cutting venezuelan oil imports
washington may be nearing a decision on extending sanctions against venezuela to include imports of venezuelan crude and exports of refined products to the troubled south american s what secretary of state rex tillerson said during a visit to argentina adding that one of the aspects of considering sanctioning oil is what effect would it have on the venezuelan people
is it a step that might bring this to an end more rapidly current sanctions target separate individuals from the nicolas maduro government as well as a ban on banks and other institutions buying venezuelan debt
venezuela has traditionally been an important exporter of oil to the united states which made washington wary of playing the oil import ban has been struggling to rein in the decline of its crude oil production resulting from underinvestment mismanagement and most recently sanctions
last october crude oil production fell to the lowest level in nearly years as pdvsa finds itself unable to pay for services rendered by oilfield service providers who are now refusing to continue working with the quality of the crude venezuela still exports to the is falling which has made buyers less willing to buy it
the trump administration last mentioned an oil import ban as a possible scenario last july ahead of a constitutional assembly vote that was widely seen as aimed at cementing maduro and his government in power despite the economic crisis that has been ravaging the country since oil prices started falling in at the time venezuelan exports were still considerable at over bpd in the first week of july eia data showed
however by november this had fallen to bpd and further to bpd as of january this year
in other words the time may be ripe to play the oil import card without affecting refiners too irina slav for top reads from
