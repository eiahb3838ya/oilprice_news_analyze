the next trade war escalation will hit u.s. oil
the trump administration is considering another ramp up of the trade war with china a move that could begin to rattle the global wall street journal reports that the trump administration is considering ratcheting up the tariffs on billion of chinese imports from the proposed percent levy to as much as percent
hiking the tariff trump s advisers seem to think will force beijing to back down and offer major concessions
whether or not those tariffs move forward remains to be seen and the administration reportedly won t make a decision until later this tariffs are justified the trump administration says because the chinese yuan continues to depreciate undercutting competitiveness
once you go down the road of using tariffs to disrupt the chinese you have to say compared to derek scissors a china expert at the american enterprise institute and adviser to the administration on trade told the problem with that logic is that the tariffs are part of the reason why china s currency is under pressure
to be sure china s economy is showing other signs of trouble from slowing growth to a rise in corporate defaults
but the yuan which is fixed against the dollar recently ran into rocky waters at least in part driven by fears of the trade the rate tightening by the federal reserve is also putting pressure on stanley estimates gdp would lose a percentage point if the trump administration imposed a percent tariff on all imports from china and europe while china would lose percentage points

there s more of the losing out here than china has emerged as the largest buyer of crude but that would quickly change with a doesn t mean that crude exports would be shut in far from it
some analysts argue it wouldn t even make much of a difference in terms of total demand
exporters could simply reroute shipments elsewhere and because china would have to make up for lost imports it would be buying from elsewhere as well
so oil flows would be reshuffled rather than significantly interrupted
still exporters might have to offer discounts to other buyers if they lose the chinese broadly however the effect of tariffs on consumer demand could be significant
the initial billion has only been lightly felt in the but moving forward with tariffs on billion of chinese imports would mean higher prices for a long list of consumer goods acting as a drag on household income
ultimately that could begin to cut into gasoline consumption
more expensive consumer goods comes hot on the heels of the sharp increase in retail gasoline prices this year
according to the eia gasoline demand dipped by bpd in may
industrial activity would also slow down further cutting into demand

china s economy would likely slow substantially with knock on effects elsewhere
it is hard to put solid figures on the downside risk especially with so much still up in the while the likelihood that creeping us protectionism spins out into a broader trade war has unfortunately moved from tail risk to plausible scenario we believe that cooler heads will ultimately prevail scotiabank wrote in a note that the world economy will be spared the worst of mercantilism s potential casualties and that commodity prices will rebound through summer s unfortunately whether or not that prediction proves accurate largely depends on the in the white house which needless to say is rather nick cunningham of top reads from
