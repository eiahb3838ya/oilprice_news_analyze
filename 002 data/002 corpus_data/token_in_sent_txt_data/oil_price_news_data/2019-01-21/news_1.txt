why opec+ output cuts take so long to materialize
the oil production cuts that opec and its partners led by russia agreed at the end of last year are proving slower to materialize than most observers expected with russia breaking another production record in december and iran s and venezuela s declines in output slowing down
that s one of the main conclusions from the latest edition of the monthly oil market report by the international energy produced million barrels of crude daily last month and according to the iea it is unclear when it will cut and by how russia undertook to reduce its production by bpd beginning this month with the cuts to last until april when will meet to review the results of its latest energy minister alexander novak warned early recently it would be difficult for russian producers to cut quickly and by a lot
due to weather and geological conditions in the cold russian winter russia can not cut its oil production too quickly novak said last week adding that there were plans to reduce oil production by bpd to bpd in january as part of the new deal
novak also added that plans were to achieve the full target by the end of is certainly one of the most important factors to watch when it comes to cuts but it appears that this time it is not the only wild card in the deck
news from venezuela and iran is also not what most industry watchers might have reasonably expected and this will also weigh on prices as it enhances the uncertainty around whether opec will be able to live up to its promises
related the world s most geopolitically charged pipelinevenezuela s pdvsa sealed two deals recently with a and a french company to boost its oil production
the state oil company offered the newcomers more lucrative deals than usual as it struggles to at least curb the inexorable decline in output
the chinese are also helping a jv between pdvsa and cnpc reported doubled production for the seven months to december
the jv sinovensa accounts for about a tenth of venezuela s total oil output
as a result the iea said output decline slowed to bpd in the second half of the year from bpd earlier in then there was iran who exported million bpd of crude in december up from the previous month according to data cited by the iea
while it s true its production according to opec data fell during that month and by a quite substantial bpd the iea notes with us waivers allowing iran s major customers to buy higher volumes than was previously thought more oil will remain in the market in the early part of
this state of affairs may persist beyond the first quarter as well as many expect washington to extend the waivers to iran s biggest oil the meantime saudi arabia is cutting deeper than it had initially agreed to and khalid is unhappy with moscow s progress
russia has started slower than i d like but they ve started and i am sure as they did as in they ll catch up and be a positive contributor to the market told cnbc earlier this of how quickly russia will cut and what will happen with venezuela s and iran s production concern about a global slowdown is deepening which means pressure on demand
the cuts may work to mitigate the effect of this concern on prices but for how long is anyone s guess
