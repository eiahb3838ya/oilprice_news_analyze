saudi arabia: we’ll pump the world’s very last barrel of oil
saudi arabia isn t buying the peak oil demand narrative
opec s largest producer continues to expect global oil demand to keep rising at least by and sees itself as the oil producer best equipped to continue meeting that demand thanks to its very low production arabia will be the one to pump the last barrel of oil in the world but it doesn t see the last barrel of oil being pumped for decades and decades to come
i don t see peak oil demand happening in years or even by amin nasser president and chief executive officer of saudi oil giant saudi aramco told cnn business emerging markets editor john defterios on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos this there will continue to be growth in oil demand we are the lowest cost producer and the last barrel will come from the region nasser told several years nasser has been saying that peak oil demand is nowhere in sight that petrochemicals will drive oil demand growth through and that all the peak oil demand and stranded resources talk is threatening an orderly energy transition and energy has just announced that its huge oil reserves are slightly higher than previously to diversify its economy away from heavy dependence on crude oil but one of the goals of its vision diversification plan is to use less oil in domestic power generation to free up more barrels for exports
related iea chief evs are not the end of the oil eraas the world s top crude oil exporter saudi arabia will not be giving away easily its crown and the geopolitical clout that comes with saudis have the two key ingredients to continue pumping oil till kingdom reserves and low production addition various organizations including opec estimate that shale production in the world s current top oil united peak at some point in the late reviving demand for crude oil from opec and its biggest oil producer saudi arabia this month saudi arabia announced that an independent estimate of its oil reserves by degolyer and macnaughton d m showed that the kingdom s total proven oil reserves were billion barrels as of the end of up from around billion barrels previously bp statistical review of world energy put saudi arabia s oil reserves at billion barrels at or percent of global oil reserves second only to venezuela s billion and macnaughton said last week that it completed the first contemporary independent assessment of reserves in saudi arabia adding that at this point it would make no further comments on this extensive this certification underscores why every barrel we produce is the most profitable in the world and why we believe saudi aramco is the world s most valuable company and indeed the world s most important saudi energy minister khalid said in the statement released by the saudi press aramco s cost of production is just a barrel later said in a news conference as carried by arabia may need oil prices higher than a barrel to balance its budget because most of the income comes from oil
yet the kingdom has what is probably the world s lowest cost of pumping one barrel of oil
related energy transition will upend geopoliticswhile surging shale production has been boosting the global oil supply which saudi arabia and opec and russia are looking to drain again with a new round of production cuts current estimates point to shale peaking in the late to the international energy agency iea tight oil production will continue rising through and thereafter with our current estimate for recoverable resources production starts to fall in its latest world oil outlook opec sees supply peaking in the late mainly because of expected tight oil supply peak
in the medium term through demand for opec crude is seen waning to million bpd in because of supply growth
but after that with the shale peak expected in the late opec forecasts that demand for its crude will start rising again to reach nearly million bpd by the world need oil in
saudi aramco s answer to this question is an emphatic yes world will continue to need a lot more oil and a lot more exploration will be needed just to offset declining oil production at mature fields aramco s nasser said in houston last energy transition is much more complex than simply replacing oil with renewables and electric vehicles evs nasser said last march and added in other words i am not losing any sleep over peak oil demand
