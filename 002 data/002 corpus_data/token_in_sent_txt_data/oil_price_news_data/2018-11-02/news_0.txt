this major cover up could wreak havoc on global oil markets
the decision facing president donald trump is not an easy one a problem not of his own choosing and one that the politically charged president would rather not have to deal sanction or not sanction saudi arabia over the alleged killing last month of prominent saudi journalist jamal khashoggi that often criticized in his washington post columns the royal family and saudi prince mohammed bin salman will dictate relations more than any other development since the arab oil embargo that sought to punish washington and its western allies over its support of israel in the fallout and disapproval has taken on a life of its own in both diplomatic circles and among global media outlets after news initially broke that jamal khashoggi had been killed in the saudi consultant in istanbul in early october
not that politically charged killings are anything new unfortunately but the problem in this instance was the inconsistencies in the saudi narrative from the narrativesaudi officials initially rejected assertions that khashoggi had even been killed
on october trump said saudi arabia king salman denied any involvement and the president suggested that rogue killers could be responsible for the killing
the next day trump said criticism of saudi arabia was another case of guilty until proven innocent
and the following day he said he contacted turkish officials and requested audio and video related to the case if it exists
however amid all of the uncertainty and political posturing turkey pushed its investigation
the associated press on october quoted a turkish official as saying police who entered the consulate found certain evidence that khashoggi was killed there
the same day the wall street journal reported that turkish officials had shared with the and saudis details of an audio recording said to prove that khashoggi was beaten drugged and then killed minutes after entering the the secretary of state mike pompeo traveled to saudi arabia to discuss the case with the saudis who according to pompeo pledged to conduct a thorough transparent and timely investigation
by the and under even more pressure both at home and abroad trump said that he believed that khashoggi was dead
it certainly looks that way to me he told reporters and added that there would be very severe consequences if investigations into khashoggi disappearance conclude the saudis are responsible

he also described the killing as a trump for his part amid the best bilateral relations between washington and riyadh in decades still stood by his saudi allies all the while pledging to safe guard the countless number of american jobs that would be lost if the canceled arms sales with the saudis
trump also said that he wasn t satisfied with the saudi account over khashoggi s of worst in historyhowever the next day trump described the killings as one of the worst in history and said he leave any ramifications against the saudis up to congress
pompeo said the would take appropriate actions against people it could identify that took part in khashoggi s murder including revoking visas and economic the narrative kept changing as more dismal reports came from turkish investigators came out including a report that khashoggi had been strangled shortly after entering the consulate and that his body had been row continuesturkey is now demanding that the saudis disclose the location of khashoggi s body after the saudis admitted that the journalist had been murdered
this case can not be covered up and we are expecting close cooperation from saudi authorities on the investigation we are conducting transparently and meticulously turkey s justice minister abdulhamit gul told reporters on have numerous other developments over khashoggi s murder including not surprisingly squabbling among eu members some who want to stop arms sales to the saudis while others push for their continuance as well as canada statement that their arms sales to the kingdom would continue
noted diplomatic and corporate leaders also pulled out of the future investment initiative fii which began in the saudi capital on october the impact over the incident that will have the greatest impact both geopolitically and in global oil markets is how the will ultimately respond
trump for his part now has little choice but play along with congressional critics that are calling for a tougher line as well as possible economic reprisals
the saudis who have learned the fine art of public relations and media management since their ill orchestrated and poorly managed oil embargo against the west some four plus decades ago have maintained that politics and economics will remain separate in essence that even if sanctions are taken against them over the killings of khashoggi it would not impact their oil production
related energy earnings pull trinidad and tobago from recessionyet if economic sanctions hit and hit hard and if they are protracted the official saudi line will likely change and see riyadh and their closest arab allies push back
and the greatest weapon they still have is the oil weapon
though global oil markets are now shifting once again from concern about a supply crunch as new sanctions hit iran energy sector in a few days worries are now growing that amid soft demand from global economic woes will continue to exert downward pressure on prices and an ensuing oil supply overhang could develop
however just the prospect of the saudis withholding oil production as a backlash for possible sanctions would be enough to roil global oil markets who act and over react on geopolitical developments particularly coming from if saudi arabia did indeed withhold barrels from global oil markets in retaliation against sanctions from the and its allies global oil markets would be impacted even more playing into the hands of tehran who all along has maintained that the world could not do without iranian oil production at full decision facing president trump as more developments come forth over khashoggi s killing has no easy answer for neither him the the saudis or global oil tim daiss for top reads
