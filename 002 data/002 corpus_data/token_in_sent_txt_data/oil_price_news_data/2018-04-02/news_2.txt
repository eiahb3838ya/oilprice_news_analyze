the bakken is booming once again
the permian has been stealing headlines and analyst attention over the past year and rightly so as it s the only shale play that continued to grow even when all others suffered during the higher oil prices over the past few months have prompted drillers to grow production not only in the permian but also in the older and more developed plays such as the bakken in north dakota and bakken crude oil production has started to grow again and is expected to beat in the first half of its own production record of million bpd from december bakken was one of the first shale basins in which drillers started to pump oil via fracking
its advantage is that the geology is better known than that of the permian
its disadvantage compared to the permian is that its sweetest spots may have already been pumped out
another disadvantage is that the bakken has higher breakevens than the top areas in the permian making its production more susceptible to oil price the bakken oil production is currently rising although the growth is overshadowed by the permian number of active drilling rigs in north dakota is currently at data by the north dakota industrial commission shows
this is way below the active rigs in early april but double the rigs in april

we re still in the third inning of the bakken development hamm shale pioneer and tycoon mark papa thinks that the bakken may have little prime spots currently chairman and ceo at centennial resource development said in a presentation in november that even in a constructive oil price environment us oil growth will be more tepid than most people are the primary reason for his prediction is the lack of remaining tier geologic quality drilling locations in the bakken and eagle ford and a lack of new substantial resource plays to boost the bakken and eagle bakken and eagle ford production will grow but much less than expected papa expectations of growth in the bakken operators will not be rushing to it like they have been doing in the permian analysts say

i would say you have core players in the bakken that are running with it that it was their baby and that s going to drive it trisha curtis president and of energy analytics and advising firm petronerds told investor s business daily last activity is rebounding in the bakken it will be incredibly sensitive to price the most sensitive of the big three oil plays benjamin shattuck research director for wood mackenzie s lower unit told investor s business to the dallas fed energy survey from march the average breakeven price to profitably drill a new well in the bakken is according to executives from e p firms
the range of responses was the narrowest range of all narrower than even the midland in the permian which has the lowest average breakeven point at but the range of responses varies from to the current oil prices at wti at around the bakken has good chances to beat its production record this year if oil prices hold on to around the tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
