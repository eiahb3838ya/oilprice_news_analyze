oil prices poised to rise as cycle comes to an end
each month i publish reports on ten to fifteen publicly traded upstream oil gas companies
part of each report is my estimation of what the company would sell for in a negotiated transaction
i ve been doing this for almost twenty years and during that time there have been several oil price cycles
the one that started in includes one of the most severe declines in crude oil prices in the last century
it has lasted much longer than the average cycle which is about two years
click to enlarge i have been working in the oil gas industry for more than years so i have lived through several boom and bust periods for upstream companies
here are a few observations oil price cycles tend to overshoot on both the upside and the downside
the price of oil never stays at the right price for very long because a small can push the price quite low and a small can cause a big price spike
during the early months of this cycle crude oil prices dropped below once oil supply demand get out of balance there is no quick fix
this is an extremely capital intense business and it takes years to set up funding and mobilize the resources for major upstream since the arab oil embargo in there has not been a prolonged period of stable oil prices and i doubt there ever will be again
we are in the inning of this cycle and we are warming up for the next boom period of higher oil the end of a down cycle is marked by an increase in m a activity
i think we saw the first of several big mergers announced on march s take a look at where we are on the price of crude oil first
then i will look at the billion merger of concho resources cxo and rsp permian rspp
i will try to explain how concho arrived at the offer price and why the deal makes sense for both pricethe price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil was on a fairly steady uptrend from the end of june through january
the price of oil dropped more than in the first half of february and then began what turned into a classic wedge formation
wedge patterns usually signal that a significant breakout is coming up or down
with oil clearly tightening it was a good bet that the breakout would be to the upside
wti began a push higher on march testing the january high
related the ultimate renewable energy hybridin my opinion the international energy agency s monthly oil market report was the catalyst for the breakout
you can find a summary of the iea report here click to enlarge of humans live in the northern hemisphere and more of them drive cars trucks and suvs each for oil is seasonal and april is the beginning of a big increase in global demand
the summer driving season is becoming more and more the high season for oil demand
fewer homes burn oil for space heating each year and there are more suvs on the road each year
china and india are the primary sources of rising global demand for oil
refiners do most of their annual maintenance projects in february and early march so they can ramp up production of transportation fuels in the second quarter
summer blends of gasoline also require more crude the end of december refinery utilization was up to
in february the utilization rate dipped below but it is now ramping back up
in last week s eia report the refinery utilization rate was for the week ending march
by the refinery utilization rate must be over if summer demand for transportation fuels is to be of the major hydrocarbon liquids inventories are at historically low levels
the and all of the oecd countries whose economies depend heavily on these commodities should have at least days of supply
eia reported the following levels of liquid inventories in the as of march
all of them are lower than the previous crude oil days of gasoline days of jet fuel days of distillates days of propane days of supplyrefined products inventories have been low since hurricane harvey shut down more than percent of refining capacity for over two months
the has struggled to get back to days of supply for most of these critical refined products
the world s largest economy is heading into the peak period of demand for transportation fuels with very little year global demand for products made primarily from oil increased by million barrels per day from the first to the second quarter
a similar spike in demand is expected this year
in their march oil market report iea said that global demand for oil will exceed supply within sixty days
click to enlarge stocks of crude oil and refined products and specifically oecd stocks remain the indicator of oil market
in this oil market report we note that in january they increased for the first time since july
however the increase of million barrels was half the average level for january seen in the past five years
indeed the surplus of total oecd stocks against the average fell for the ninth successive month to million barrels with products showing a very small iea oil market report march numbers here is where i need to remind you that we live in a world that will soon be consuming over million barrels per day of oil based products
the surplus of million barrels is just twelve hours of goes on to say is clearly moving ahead with key indicators supply and demand becoming more closely aligned oecd stocks falling close to average levels the forward price curve in backwardation at prices that increasingly appear to be sustainable pointing in that direction
in our chart we assume for scenario purposes that opec production remains flat for the rest of and on this basis there will be very small stock builds in with deficits in the rest of the year
with supply from venezuela clearly vulnerable to an accelerated decline without any compensatory change from other producers it is possible that the latin american country could be the final element that tips the market decisively into related an oil price rally is likelysince the iea report was publish on march there have been more signs of oil market tightening petrobras brazil s no
oil producer announced that february liquids production was barrels per day down the fifth consecutive monthly government data shows that colombia oil production in february was down amid intensified pipeline sabotage with negative for according to media reports production at the kashagan field an offshore oil field in kazakhstan s zone of the caspian sea eni shell total exxon are among the partners has fallen from barrels per day to barrels per day just since march
the field discovered in that is located in the northern part of the caspian sea is considered the world largest discovery in the last on march ecopetrol warned of potentially drastic sanctions by colombia environment minister following an oil spill in santander province earlier this point here is that when the global oil market tightens as it clearly is unplanned supply disruptions can have a significant impact on the price of now knows that venezuela is going over the cliff but what if the supply growth from the shale plays is not quite as robust as eia keeps telling us
what if president trump rips up the previous administration s iranian nuke deal
what if there is a forest fire in canada that shuts in production
stuff happens and it often happens when we least expect oil price cycles tend to the mark
the right price for oil is probably around but if there is any unplanned disruption in the supply chain it will go a lot higher in a hurry because for the rest of the year demand for oil will exceed m a activity marks the end of oil price cycleson march concho resources cxo and rsp permian rspp announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which concho will acquire rsp in an transaction valued at approximately billion inclusive of rsp s net debt
this is the largest upstream merger since the oil price decline began in june
i believe it marks the official end of this oil price cycle and will only be the first of several more significant and rsp permian are running a total of drilling rigs in the permian basin arguably the most important oil gas resource play on this planet
in my opinion the permian basin in west texas and southeast new mexico is the most valuable real estate in the united states
click to enlarge increased m a activity marks the end of oil price cycles because the big fish take the opportunity and they have the capital to scoop up the little fish
rsp permian is not really a little fish but it is a great fit for march i published a profile on rsp permian with my estimated fair value of
based on concho s share price the day before the merger was announced they are buying it for approximately so i think the rsp shareholders got it at a fair price
plus this is a tax free exchange into another company that has to upside if oil prices stay over m sure that multiple reports will be published that say concho overpaid for rsp but we won t really know for several more years
most of rsp s leasehold fits in nicely with what concho had and it gives them another horizontal drilling locations in the permian basin
plus rsp is currently producing approximately barrels of crude oil barrels of ngls and mcf of natural gas per day boe per day which generate over million per quarter gross if the merger is successful the acquisition adds approximately net acres to concho s already vast permian basin portfolio net delaware basin acres and net midland basin acres
we estimate the deal value at per net undeveloped acre a significant premium to recent public deals in the area on average
it could generate higher valuations for other operators in the basin and help close the gap between recent private and public deal raymond james march energy industry briefso the question that i m getting from our subscribers is which upstream companies are the next most likely targets here is a list of the small and companies that i follow closely along with my fair value estimate for each of them
this does not mean any of them will be acquired and some of them may be buyers
i will say that the companies with large blocks of contiguous leasehold most of which is held by production are the most attractive takeover targets
i list them in alphabetical order without any indication as to which ones i believe have the best chance of being acquired
frankly no one really knows but i m sure that most of these companies are on the radar screens of with deep that oil price cycles tend to overshoot the mark by a wide margin
this one is definitely headed in that dan steffens for top reads from
