will china continue its canadian crude buying spree?
chinese refiners have been buying a lot of canadian crude oil in the last couple of months taking advantage of the massive discount of western canadian select to west texas intermediate
the purchases have given troubled canadian drillers hope for the future that even without the trans mountain expansion their crude could expand on asian purchased million barrels of heavy canadian crude oil for loading in september up by nearly percent compared to the million barrels it imported from canada in april bloomberg reported last month quoting data by and intelligence company month chinese refiners continued buying canadian crude with tanker loadings bound for china reaching million barrels since the start of september bloomberg data this is not a whole lot of oil
if it were a million barrels daily then we could probably speak of a seismic shift in the export markets of canadian crude a shift that would make it more competitive by introducing another buyer besides refiners
even at the current level though the chine refiners intake of canadian crude indicates a change might be coming
yet this change will only come if chinese refiners can offer canadian producers good prices that beat the prices that the west coast refiners are prepared to have yet to see how this plays out because the past two months were refinery maintenance season in the united states and a lot of refineries have yet to ramp up to full production
this means that they have yet to ramp up their purchases of heavy canadian crude that they need to make fuels
and this means the chinese buyers have yet to face the competition of the refiners
related oil production is set to soar past million bpdchances are they will face it with a smile because the huge discount of western canadian select to wti is not the only reason for this shift
the other reason has to do with supply
china s two other main sources of heavy and both going through a production decline albeit for different reasons
so chinese refiners simply don t have much of a choice when it comes to sourcing the heavy crude blends that they need
when one supplier can not deliver you turn to whoever potentially huge market is what motivated the expansion of the trans mountain pipeline that turned into a bone of contention between neighbors british columbia and alberta
however there is little chance the expansion will begin anytime soon what with all the opposition and legal challenges from environmentalists and first nations
alberta is not giving up the fight but it s not making a lot of progress if chinese refiners continue to buy canadian crude even without the cheaper pipeline channel it would significantly brighten the prospects of canada s oil industry
the problem is if does not mean will
one additional reason for the surge in chinese buying of canadian crude this fall was the peak of construction season hence an increased asphalt demand hence greater heavy crude demand
as construction season reaches its end this particular demand will decline with it
yet if the price of canadian heavy remains attractive even after refineries ramp up chinese companies may well continue to buy now that they ve got a taste of it
especially since venezuelan production is still declining
