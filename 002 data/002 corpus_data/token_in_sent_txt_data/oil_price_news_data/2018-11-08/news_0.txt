opec fears another downturn in oil
oil prices have fallen so far in the past month that opec is clearly growing concerned about a arabia and russia will explore the possibility of a production cut for a move intended to head off a renewed supply glut
surging shale production plus higher output from russia saudi arabia the uae iraq and libya has more than offset the declines from iran at least so far
inventories have climbed sharply in the and shale production in recent months has exceeded a production cut would be a dramatic turnaround for the oil cartel which until recently had to repeatedly reassure the oil market that supplies were adequate and that they were prepared to meet any hypothetical shortfall with fresh course correction is jarring
the message from opec looks like fasten the seat belts bob mcnally president of rapidan energy advisors llc told bloomberg
opec will essentially put pedal to the metal to boost production and then immediately slam the brakes pretty hard and talk about cutting saudi arabia has been worried about this scenario for several months at least
when oil prices were rising over the summer and again in september saudi officials pointed to upcoming seasonal demand weakness in the winter
there are more demand threats next year compared to supply threats an unnamed saudi source told reuters in september
still the markets were concerned about shortages brent jumped to the per barrel and there was widespread speculation about the extent of saudi spare month and a half on riyadh and moscow are mulling over a production cut
a lot has changed in such a short period of time
libya restored a huge amount of disrupted supply
saudi arabia ramped up production to million barrels per day up bpd since the opec meeting in june
perhaps most importantly the has been producing a lot more oil than previously thought
in august production jumped by more than bpd from june levels an unbelievably large oil production is set to soar past million bpdon wednesday the eia reported yet another large crude oil inventory increase with stocks jumping by million barrels in the first week of november up to million barrels
shockingly the eia said the produced an astounding for the week ending on november
the weekly figures tend to be a bit less reliable and are subject to revision later on
but the figure is still a sign that shale production is growing very the us energy information administration now predicts that it will increase to million barrels per day in the second quarter of
originally this was not expected to happen until late commerzbank said in a note
this will force opec to reverse its latest increase in oil production by roughly million barrels per day again if it does not want to risk a massive oversupply and a further slide in oil to top it off the trump administration s decision to grant waivers to eight countries importing iranian oil takes a lot of the edge off the market
this alone helps explain a lot of the motivation behind saudi arabia s renewed interest in production cuts for next year
if around of oil exports from iran is no longer going offline that almost completely removes the need for more saudi supply
with iran still online the rest of opec may now need to reduce is exactly what the iranians are saying
saudi arabia and russia have increased production and prices have come down a barrel hossein kazempour ardebili iran s representative to opec said in a bloomberg interview
they have the market and now need to eliminate of is shale the future for big oil to top it off the global economy is facing some major questions marks especially as we head into
any slowdown will hit crude oil demand
they will absolutely want to at some point next year try to arrange a reduction in production said ed morse head of commodities at citigroup according to bloomberg
everything points to a fairly weak balance the world economy is decelerating the china trade tensions are having a visible impact on it would be difficult to achieve consensus from the more than dozen opec member countries but then again saudi arabia and russia have demonstrated that they can do what they want on their own even if the rest of opec opposes bottom line is that even the mere rumor of a production cut offers some evidence that the oil market is a lot looser than it was a few weeks ago
the head of the iea warned that the oil market is not out of the woods yet pointing to the in venezuelan production
however sentiment has clearly shifted
the market has yet to prove that it can hold onto a rally so the mood is still very negative phil flynn analyst at price futures group told nick cunningham of top reads from
