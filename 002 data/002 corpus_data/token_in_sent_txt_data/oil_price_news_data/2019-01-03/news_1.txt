2019 could make or break opec
when agreed to begin cutting crude oil production again in december hardly anyone in the cartel thought the effect of the news on prices would be as lackluster as it turned out to be
it took some time for the fact to sink in that this time too many traders were worried about the future of oil demand and were reluctant to speculate with oil
now opec is facing another tough year perhaps even tougher than and it might just need to reduce production even more to make it well morgan said prior to the opec meeting early december that if opec didn t really cut by more than around million barrels per day and they did just for the first half not for the full year that we could gravitate toward our scenario which is brent for the investment bank s head of oil and gas for the told cnbc this we expect oil markets to remain volatile in part driven by flexible north american shale production that can ramp up and down quickly in response to changes in investment levels conocophillips ceo ryan lance told bloomberg also this american shale production is of course the challenge for opec s plans
two years ago it was easier nobody was sure exactly how flexible shale oil production can be so the opec cuts worked helped by a brighter global economic outlook
now things are different
shale production is growing despite the slump in prices and although this may change if prices fall further or stay at current levels for longer this is far from certain in the last week of december after prices have been on the decline for three months drillers continued adding rigs
related the new oil orderyet it wasn t just production that rose last year russia s hit a new record in at million bpd which made it the producer after the united states
saudi arabia also pumped at a record level of over million bpd in the months that followed the june decision to reverse the cuts to rein in prices
this is the context in which agreed the new cuts which were bpd lower than the ones agreed in
no wonder skepticism is analysts believe that once the cuts enter into effect which they did at the start of the new year the effect on prices will come to be felt
but jp morgan s scott darling may just turn out to be right yesterday news that saudi arabia had reduced its crude oil exports by half a million barrels daily pushed up prices only briefly before both brent and west texas intermediate faltered and slid down six months may be enough to reduce the combined output of opec and its partners by the agreed million bpd if production continues to grow at the current rate it would likely offset this cut completely
true the amount of crude that is added or leaves the global markets is not the only factor that counts the type of crude is also important and oil is overwhelmingly light crude while there is also global demand for heavier grades that the middle east and russia produce
yet grades are rarely the top concern of traders when they hear words like oversupply
volatility as conoco s ryan lance said is clearly here to stay and will likely intensify in the coming months
opec might just be forced to extend the cuts it agreed in december if a positive effect from this agreement fails to materialize soon
