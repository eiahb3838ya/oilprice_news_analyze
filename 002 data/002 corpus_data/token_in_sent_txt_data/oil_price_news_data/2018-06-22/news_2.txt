opec+ proposes 1-million-bpd production increase
update opec chairman kachikwu says that will add bpd real barrels the joint ministerial monitoring committee of opec russia and the other partners has proposed a production increase of million barrels daily russia s energy minister alexander novak told media in vienna after the june meeting of the number was made public about a month ago but there were doubts that some opec members would back such a large increase in production
most of these doubts have been dispelled now it reports that after a night of drama the ministerial committee agreed on the proposal with the notable exception of iran s bijan zanganeh who left the meeting early saying that opec would not reach a consensus decision on the increase at today s figure is theoretical only saudi energy minister khalid was quick to note
the actual increase will likely be closer to bpd he said as not all opec members have the spare capacity to raise production
the most obvious example here is struggling venezuela but iraq is also opposed to any production increase
mexico a but a signatory of the deal also can t boost its production at the moment
related why opec wo flood the oil marketthese two will probably make it harder for opec to reach a decision today but as history has proven they will also probably end up signing up for the increase which would leave iran as the only opponent and effectively the since all opec decisions must be so those opec members that are for the production boost can regroup and start pumping more despite iran s opposition
in other words with or without an official opec consensus the production increase many have been waiting for is all but original deal involved oil producers who agreed to take off million bpd from the market
as of may however thanks to production declines in venezuela and several african producers compliance to the deal reached percent setting the stage for a change of tack towards global oil market irina slav for top reads from
