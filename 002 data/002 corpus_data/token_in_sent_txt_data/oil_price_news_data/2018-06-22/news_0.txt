gulf of mexico production expected to hit record high
while the shale production in the permian has been grabbing most of the market and media attention over the past two years the gulf of mexico has been quietly staging a comeback
big oil firms the main operators in the gulf of mexico have been cutting costs and simplifying designs to make offshore projects viable in the oil price shell and bp continue with their deepwater developments offshore louisiana and texas and have brought down breakeven costs to a barrel or with the breakevens at some shale formations onshore
now operators are vying for new exploration acreage close to existing production platforms that would bring development and production costs down even further
while the market and media have focused on the record permian production the gulf of mexico s production is also expected to hit a record high this year
but there s one huge difference between onshore and offshore in terms of resource shale wells production peaks in several months while vast deepwater resources can pump oil for oil continues to bet on resources and projects that will last for decades but companies have drastically changed their approach to development
gone are the days in which the race was to have the biggest the most complex and most expensive bespoke project the industry has seen
it may have worked at oil prices at but at half that price of oil the focus is on leaner projects and more collaborative work to bring costs shale ceo to be the world s top oil producer by falltop executives at the largest operators in the gulf of mexico admit that project costs before were we knew there was incredible waste but was the trigger harry brekelmans shell projects and technology director tells we knew there was no way we could put forward a project in the same way in april this year shell announced the final investment decision for vito a deepwater development in the gulf of mexico with a breakeven price estimated at less than a barrel
after the oil prices started crashing shell began in to redesign the vito project reducing cost estimates by more than percent from the original concept the oil major said in late collaborated internally and externally to optimize the supply chain to drill standardized wells and to build designs more efficiently brekelmans said at the offshore technology conference in houston a week month shell started early production at the kaikias deepwater subsea development in the gulf of mexico a year ahead of schedule and at a price of less than per barrel of oil
shell s brekelmans said earlier this year that the supermajor was targeting its deepwater projects to break even at or preferably below that oil major bp has cut project costs for its mad dog project in the gulf by percent to us billion working with and contractors to simplify and standardize the platform s says that offshore crude oil extraction including deepwater is closing in on shale in terms of cost thanks to new production in the past a lot of the cost of development has been new technology jeff shellebarger president of chevron s north american division told bloomberg
with the types of reservoirs we re drilling today most of that learning curve is behind us
now we can keep those costs pretty according to wood mackenzie oil and gas production in deepwater gulf of mexico is expected to reach an record high this year at million boepd of which percent is the previous record from by nearly percent and representing growth year over
crude oil production in the federal gulf of mexico increased slightly in to reach million bpd the highest annual level on record the eia said in april adding that production is expected to continue growing this year and next accounting for percent of total crude oil production
according to the eia a total of deepwater gulf of mexico field starts are expected in and overtakes saudi arabia in recoverable oil reservesexploration investment however is still flat and operators are in a wait and see mode wood mackenzie said in march in a comment on the latest lackluster lease sale in the gulf
bidding was focused on the mississippi area with established infrastructure and lowest cost operators are keen to keep the utilization up on the infrastructure and every new barrel produced through these facilities further realizes value from the original investment william turner senior research analyst at wood mackenzie meanwhile some patient but dedicated operators are on the brink of cracking the code on developments
once the industry sees some proven developments in fields like anchor others will follow suit and we will begin to see the return of significant volumes being discovered and developed in the by tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
