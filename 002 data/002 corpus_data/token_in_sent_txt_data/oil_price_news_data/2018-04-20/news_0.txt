will u.s. shale offset soaring global oil demand?
oil has rallied sharply in recent days to see west texas intermediate wti trading at just under per barrel and brent breaking through the per barrel mark with crude trading at its highest price since
the surge in oil can be directly attributed to a wide variety of geopolitical risks which are sparking considerable fears that global oil supplies could be sharply constrained in coming months
this has triggered considerable speculation that per barrel is on its to some pundits the bearish factors which have weighed on oil prices for some time have been priced in by the the perception of geopolitical risk and how it is driving oil higher appears to be overbaked and there are a range of threats to the per barrel oil narrative
key is that oil production is expanding at a rapid clip
the eia recently estimated that domestic production had hit barrels daily its highest level since starting to provide this data in the early
the international energy agency iea believes that the will overtake russia to become the world s largest oil producer by big question is whether this along with a marked expansion in the volume of drilled but uncompleted wells ducs and rig count which in early april reached its highest point in three years is enough to suppress prices
the answer could surprise investors because fundamentals indicate that higher oil is here to stay for as long as saudi arabia and russia don t aggressively unwind the production caps established in november is contrary to the thoughts of some analysts including those at barclays who believe that oil will weaken once again to per barrel during the of
what many analysts who are betting on lower oil are discounting is the effect of stronger global economic growth on the demand for energy
world gross domestic product gdp has been forecast by the international monetary fund imf for to expand at percent which is basis points higher than the percent projected for markets are also surging with many expected to post significant growth in
when those factors coupled with the improved economic outlook led by trump s corporate tax reform are considered it is likely that the global gdp will expand at a greater than the percent projected
that will fuel even greater demand growth for the iea has revised its estimates many times
at its last revision in the iea estimated that demand growth would top million barrels daily for the year which is barrels higher than its earlier forecast
there is every sign that the global economic upswing which is underway will boost demand even imf expect oil to fall below only need to consider that in when global gdp expanded by percent which is lower than the percent forecast for global energy demand for the year grew by percent or double
opec has forecast demand growth for the year of over million barrels daily while the eia is predicting that it will be even higher at million barrels
the upper end of those later forecasts appears more realistic than the million barrels predicted by the you add in growing middle east tensions volatile security conditions in nigeria and libya trump s push to the nuclear deal with iran and venezuela s oil industry descending into freefall there is every risk of a significant supply outage being triggered by geopolitical risks
it is likely that with venezuela s production deteriorating at a greater clip than has been priced in by markets this along with trump pushing to reinstate sanctions against iran could wipe more than barrels daily off global could certainly push brent to the per barrel mark or higher which appears to be saudi arabia s desired it is questionable whether those unexpected supply constraints working with rising demand growth would be enough to push oil to primarily because the rapid growth in oil output could meet some of that is becoming clear is that a range of factors including geopolitical threats along with stronger than anticipated economic growth driving greater demand for oil means that the higher oil narrative has some way to playout
that combined with saudi arabia flagging that it intends to continue cooperating with russia on production caps will prevent global oil markets from tipping into oversupply as some analysts claim will occur in late mathew smith for top reads from
