renewables are booming in oil country
the rapid growth of the renewable energy sector has been have been the sources of energy worldwide and we re seeing solar power coming in first as the source companies in particular have been embracing this renewable revolution but it s not just silicon valley that s heading into this businesses like starbucks and target have been getting in on it as well who have each announced aggressive targets to run percent of its global operations with renewable the midst of an energy revolution like this one it s easy to miss the subtleties involved in making it there is one simple reason as to why renewables are in oil territory renewables are boomingboth solar and wind continue to decline in operating costs while increasing in energy efficiency
the combination is making it difficult for coal to recover and poses a challenge in what had been west texas for permian basin which straddles texas and new mexico continues to be one of the most prolific drilling locations in the operating costs as compared to wellhead prices the price producers actually receive for the volume coming out of the ground make for some profitable fields even at low oil the same location has also become the largest in the country for wind is even this deep in oil country texas produces more wind energy than the next three states is saudi arabia losing its asian oil market share currently the lone star state accounts for nearly a fourth of the nation s wind power capacity and current wind projects have the capacity to generate over megawatts mw of s enough to power more than million both solar and wind the assumption not long ago was that once government subsidies had been phased out a ceiling would form on additional renewable power this argument in favor of a return to dominance for traditional energy sources failed to consider one salient cheaper energy sourcesolar and wind have become far cheaper to produce than even their strongest adherents had expected
that means they have both reached and exceeded grid parity their generating costs being equal or lower than those of natural gas and even nuclear remains the cheapest way to produce the high costs of constructing nuclear power plants and the still long delays in approval and finishing the plants have propelled renewables into an ascendancy in the fuel oil hardly figures into the equation in the until the next massive wave switch in vehicle engines electric hybrid cng compressed natural gas and lng liquefied natural gas distillates gasoline and diesel will have the lion share of the transport fuel means that on the electricity production front this has become a competition between coal and natural gas on the one hand and renewables solar and wind with a marginal presence of biofuel and geothermal on the natural gas production in the would seem to have been given a boost by the trump administration s support for hydrocarbons
the problem has been a persistent surplus of production combined with a penchant by mother nature to produce mellower than expected temperatures which drives down air conditioning use and thus power can saudi arabia afford its megaprojects the latter is likely to change as we move into summer and hotter the bottom line remains the new energy powerhouse is heresolar and wind have become far more competitive and have in some cases west texas wind and the southwest solar for example emerged as the preferable of which has set the stage for a very different scenario following the decision to make the one of only three nations opposed to the paris climate then that number is misleading since nicaragua largely opposes the agreement because it did not go far enough in combatting climate leaves just the and syria of all here is the interesting the elimination of government support and new management at the environmental protection agency epa bent on resurrecting coal solar and wind continue to undercut the cost of increasing reliance on simply renewables are progressively becoming the energy currency of choice regardless of what exercise in political dominoes the administration had in consider and wind employees total nearly in the domestic workforce a figure likely to be doubled by coal jobs have dwindled to less than a quarter as the renewable energy sector and will decline even further by the end of the of the electoral machinations practiced in the white house the market itself is making its own there will remain a position for coal in the developing energy balance it s not going to return to its dominance of last king coal will have to give up his throne to a new ruler in the energy kent moorsmore top reads from
