crude-by-rail could save the permian boom
cbr has been a savior for north american producers seeking higher returns for heavily discounted crudes caused by a lack of pipeline capacity
and cbr once again is on the rise
north american shipments of petroleum and petroleum products are up over compared to
in may nearly barrels per day were shipped by rail from canada to the nearly five times that of june
but the story of cbr is really about how price differentials became so large in certain western canadian producers intense opposition regulatory changes legal limbo political tensions and foreign interference from well funded environmental lobbies have muddled new projects
in western canada new export capacity has been politically denied northern gateway cancelled energy east or is still in the process of getting the darn shovels in the ground trans mountain expansion keystone xl and enbridge line expansion producers the story is quite a bit different
while opposition has been present at standing rock for example midstreamers largely could not keep up with blistering pace of production set off by the shale the us energy information administration eia estimates that us crude production will more than double that of and sit around million barrels per day
often pipelines were needed where there was no previous or oil or natural gas infrastructure
in addition pipelines can t be built overnight years of planning permitting and construction are global crude prices now stabilized from the price crash in all is not well in western canada and west mexico
massive price differentials are preventing some producers from enjoying the current price recovery
a large western canadian texas intermediate differential is back sitting at a painful us per barrel august
and morgan stanley suggests that with increasing permian production and lack of take away capacity the differential of per barrel july could blowout to per barrel in

to start lease rates for dot cars have jumped from to per month
the size of the crude oil fleet sits at about cars compared to nearly in
and tariffs affecting new pipeline construction could also impact the rail companies that do not make the trump administration s steel tariff waiver list one can expect additional costs for tanker car construction to be passed onto customers
producers hit by large price differentials may have to pay even more for each new or tanker car they buy or make matters worse bnsf is now refusing to haul tanker cars the majority of which are legacy cars retrofitted with additional safety features
this would complicate things for the owners of roughly tanker cars because bnsf moves a lot of crude
in the last quarter of nearly half of all cbr was shipped by bnsf
if other rail operators do the same those could quickly be sent to america s empty places to collect graffiti and birds nests just like thousands of
although tanker car manufacturers have been building at a steady clip about since the impact of removing over from service will be more than noticeable
not every owner may be in a position to fork over additional dollars to buy especially after retrofitting their old or it to say american fuel and petrochemical manufacturers are concerned with bnsf s decision to refuse certain tank cars and are currently considering options to address these concerns with the however bnsf may very well indeed have the right to exclude use of equipment that it feels is unsafe or too risky to haul
we shall see how this pans factors can also impact cbr
major logistical issues arise during extended periods of extreme cold weather in canada and the northern for example rail operators deal with icy tracks and can t haul as many tanker cars
likewise trains must run at lower speeds and more locomotives are needed to move the same volume of product
this can lead to rail terminal congestion
cbr shippers also have to contend with grain shippers after fall harvest during the winter months
related who profits from iran s oil major exodus and then there are unique factors that arise based on the region
for example the permian is sucking up of all frac sand and ironically enough is impacting cbr capacity in the in western canada and the permian will be paying close attention to the outcome of trump s steel tariff waiver list both tanker car manufacturers and midstreamers bnsf s decision to ban tankers and other regional factors that can impede take away capacity
the eia estimates production soaring to million barrels per day in
canadian heavy crude could rise by half a million barrels per day in the same period
but even without pressure on the market for tanker cars suggesting cbr is a for new north american pipelines may be quite a
plains all american pipeline s steel tariff waiver application was rejected for the cactus ii pipeline which would run from the permian to corpus christi
future pipelines in the region may also be forced to pay for domestic steel piping or pay a tariff on imports if they do not get white house approval for tariff justin ziebart for top reads from
