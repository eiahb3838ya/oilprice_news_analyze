the $80 billion megaproject splurge in oil
the oil and gas industry has been in recovery mode for at least a year now and although the improvement in performance is clearly there the pace of the recovery has been somewhat uneven
projects are usually a good gauge of an industry s performance so as wood mackenzie analysts noted in a recent report a lineup of megaprojects scheduled for final investment decision over the next months will tell us how the recovery is actually now says wood mac analyst angus rodger author of the better project delivery upstream value opportunity report investors are watching oil and gas companies closely in anticipation of more good news after the launch of several megaprojects on time and within budget and of course the increased investor problem with the industry seems to be that when the going is good financial discipline tends to slacken off leading to project delays and cost overruns
in fact before the last downturn the biggest project cost overruns combined came in at us billion which makes an average of percent over budget for each of these
investors are right to watch the industry closely lest it return to its old are certainly improving and project delivery has become more efficient rodger says with the average lead time from final investment decision to project launch down to less than three years in from more than four back in and the average payback period down to about six years from more than in factors driving this improvement are six as identified by rodger and these six factors would ensure the their lack would next string of megaprojects that include lng development in mozambique the arctic papua new guinea and canada and oil projects in nigeria brazil the gulf of mexico senegal and the north sea as well as the caspian and uganda
related is deepwater drilling more profitable than shale first among these factors is spare capacity but not just spare production capacity but capacity across the supply chain
the abundance of spare capacity allows oil and gas companies to do better at a lower comes an emerging trend in the industry and this trend is for increased collaboration between the upstream industry and oilfield services providers
for now rodger says this trend is clearly evident in northern europe but it because it improves performance and ultimately bottom unsurprisingly is corporate discipline
the last downturn taught oil and gas companies to be stricter in their project screening and activities so now they are wary of projects that would almost certainly go into cost overruns
related shale profits remain elusivethe fourth factor rodger identifies on the report is simply better project management
the downturn contributed here as well
now there are fewer projects to choose from so companies can allow themselves to really make the best of fifth factor is related to the fourth better planning
with fewer projects and more attention given to each companies are securing everything that can be secured in a project in advance including contracts that are now more often awarded to existing partners instead of tendered oil and gas companies have as a result of the downturn and the financial constraints it forced on them turned to smaller and projects
this shift has improved the chances of success for these projects
now the only danger is from the industry turning its back on all these as oil prices climb higher and giving in to the temptation of growth without the means to maintain irina slav for top reads from
