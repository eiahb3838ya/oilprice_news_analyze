venezuelan oil exports plunge on ‘harsher’ sanctions
venezuela s oil production could be disrupted to a greater degree than most analysts first thought as the government seeks essentially shut in the country s oil the trump administration first announced sanctions on venezuela s oil sector a little over a week ago it sounded as if they would simply bar companies from buying oil
that would still mean that venezuela could ship the oil elsewhere albeit at a painful the treasury issued some more details on february sketching out a harsher sanctions regime
the sanctions on venezuela will actually resemble the measures targeting iran in that it will bar companies from using the financial system to do business with pdvsa
as such the reach of the sanctions will extend well beyond the shores of the united reported that even prior to last friday s clarification from the treasury european buyers were already slashing purchases because of concerns over payments
reuters reported that two of the world s largest oil traders vitol and trafigura said that they would comply with all a result pdvsa and maduro s government could have a much harder time finding destinations for venezuelan oil than first thought
the wall street journal reported oil storage is filling up in venezuela because of a lack of wood mac venezuela s oil output to fall below million bpdmoreover not only are the effects of the sanctions more but also more immediate than first thought
at first the seemed to exempt shipments that were underway outlining a sort of phased approach that would allow a handful of american refiners to gradually unwind their oil purchase from venezuela
the phased approach which was supposed to be extended into april would help to minimize any immediate disruptions secretary of treasury steven mnuchin said in late that now does not appear to be what is unfolding
pdvsa has demanded upfront payment likely because it fears not being paid at all or having the revenues steered to the opposition
indeed the effort to steer pdvsa and its revenues into the hands of the opposition leader juan gauidó appears to be a decisive turning tankers linked to chevron lukoil and respsol are delayed redirected or sitting offshore because of lack of payment
the wsj says that several of those tankers had recently sent oil to corpus christi texas but are now anchored off the coast of maracaibo sitting idle
this is an absolute disaster luis hernández a venezuelan oil union leader told the wsj
there s almost no way to move the unable to sell any oil maduro s regime could quickly run out of cash
the result could be a humanitarian catastrophe a merciless and destructive objective that the trump administration seems to have in mind
the government is essentially betting that by driving the country into the ground the military and the people will turn on maduro
it could yet turn out that way but it could also deepen the misery and exact an unspeakable toll on the venezuelan population the very people the trump administration says it is trying to the meantime oil exports are likely heading into a freefall
the wsj says that labor problems including mass defections of workers are accelerating declines
pdvsa could soon run out of refined with knowledge of the situation told the wsj that venezuela s oil production has likely already fallen well below million barrels per day down more than percent at least from december opec s oil princes are fighting for survivalwood mackenzie estimates that production probably stands a little bit higher at about but that it could soon fall to s hard to imagine how maduro can hang on if oil exports fall precipitously from here
but even if he does manage to stay in power the may escalate the situation
last month national security adviser john bolton had troops to colombia written on his legal pad
president trump himself said that a military intervention is an the oil market the crisis presents a series of problems
if maduro hangs on and the continues to heap more pressure on his government venezuelan oil production and exports will continue to fall
alternatively the is hoping for a quick regime change after which it would lift sanctions which it believes will lead to a reversal in output next round of iran sanctions is nearing with sanctions waivers expiring in may
as such the window of opportunity for the trump administration is open only a crack necessitating a quick political change barclays wrote in a note
by the third quarter the loss of venezuelan output iran sanctions and the looming regulations from the international maritime organization will put an increasing premium on medium and heavy would push up oil prices significantly
but the government has blown past the point of no return leaving it with no other options except to escalate
that means that venezuela is set to lose a lot more oil than analysts thought only two weeks nick cunningham of top reads from
