oil prices slip on large crude inventory build
after yesterday the american petroleum institute served a not so pleasant surprise to oil bulls by reporting a increase in crude oil inventories in the united states the energy information administration confirmed the bad news estimating a increase in oil inventories for the week to april processed million bpd of crude producing million barrels per day of gasoline and million barrels of distillate
this compares to million bpd of gasoline and million bpd of distillate a week inventories increased by million barrels last week after an increase a week earlier
distillate stockpiles were down by million barrels compared with a decline a week traded at us a barrel at the time of writing with brent crude at us
wti was slightly up from yesterday s close while brent was down a third of a percentage markets anticipate that president trump will decide to pull out of the iran nuclear deal which would lead to a spike in prices although how high a spike it will be is anyone s guess the decision has been expected for a few weeks trump might just surprise everyone by deciding to stay in the deal despite alleged evidence that iran lied about its nuclear program which was revealed publicly by israel s pm benjamin netanyahu
if this happens prices will definitely correct production will also have a negative impact on price developments when the eia releases its full weekly petroleum report later in the day
last week the daily average stood at million barrels making the the producer globally behind only russia with million bpd
yet it is possible that the will overtake russia relatively soon since the start of daily production has grown by more than a million irina slav for top reads from
