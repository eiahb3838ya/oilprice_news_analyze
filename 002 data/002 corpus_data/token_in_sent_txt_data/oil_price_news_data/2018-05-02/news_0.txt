texas sees unparalleled economic boom from oil prices
is like the new dallas fed economist michael plante told reuters last month commenting on the effect of the oil prices on the texas production in the only shale play whose output didn t decline during the now booming and is fueling the economic growth in west texas cities of midland and odessa
employment is near highs unemployment is at record lows home sales building permits and hotel revenues are surging
wages are up and so are residents are aware of the fact that the boom won t last forever but right now the economy is booming as is oil production in west eia estimates that the permian production hit million bpd in april and is set to rise to million bpd in highest increase among the main shale to the latest dallas fed energy survey executives from exploration and production firms put the average breakeven prices to profitably drill a new well at a barrel for midland in the lowest among all oil basins
for existing wells the survey found that midland s average oil price to cover operating expenses was a barrel with responses ranging from just over to as much per barrel oil
midland s average breakeven for existing wells is again the lowest in the united states
related is the golden era for renewables around the corner the cities of midland and odessa in the permian are now booming in lockstep with the oil production in the early as in october last year midland ranked fifth in the cities in the ranking by wallethub which compared cities of varying population sizes based on two key dimensions sociodemographics and jobs economy
midland ranked fourth in terms of midsize cities with the highest bureau of labor statistics said in march in its county employment and wages summary that midland texas had the largest percentage increase in employment between september and september above the national job growth rate of percent
in midland the biggest jump in employment was in natural resources and mining which gained jobs in the year through september recent data as of february shows that midland employment increased by percent in february from a year ago and unemployment rate dropped to percent from percent in february
taxable spending car purchases hotel and motel receipts sales of existing homes and permits for new homes all surged this year compared to record low unemployment however is a headache for business only in oil and struggle to find enough local staff for construction projects and restaurants for example midland mayor jerry morales told unemployment rate in odessa texas dropped to percent in february from percent in february

but this is not to suggest the industry is in the midst of a slow recovery as it tries to crawl its way back to the salad days of the previous expansion it does suggest that efficiencies have improved so greatly that those levels of activity are not presently needed to produce more petroleum in the permian basin than has ever been produced before said ingham

companies such as noble energy and encana corporation seek to reduce their exposure to midland texas crude possible growth slowdown ahead midland and odessa s economies are for now feeling the permian the recovery from the downturn is swift and magnificent
and the recovery phase is nearing its end will be accomplished when the regional economic index reaches and exceeds its prior peak and moves into previously uncharted record territory ingham said in tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
