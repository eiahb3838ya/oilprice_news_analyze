china’s growing oil demand has created a geopolitical dilemma
china has become the world s largest oil importer and despite establishing the largely successful oil futures beijing will have to grapple with an overlooked geopolitical and economic consequence as it seeks to quench its thirst for oil and china relies more on both foreign crude oil imports and imported gas in the form of lng and piped gas from neighboring countries the outflow of or in this case will see the country contend with the dilemma that the faced a massive transfer of capital to foreign oil yet for the at the time of its foreign oil import dependence the transfer of funds was often to middle eastern oil producers including saudi arabia who in the and could arguably have been called a or at least an ally of convenience
the needed saudi oil as american oil production continued to decline while oil consumption spiked to unprecedented levels
for their part the saudis needed and still do the navy s to keep open vital shipping lanes including the world s most important maritime chokepoint the strait of hormuz to allow the export of massive cargoes of crude to foreign s insatiable oil thirstchina surpassed the in annual gross crude oil imports in by importing million barrels per day bpd compared with million bpd of crude oil imports
china had become the world largest net importer imports less exports of total petroleum and other liquid fuels in
new refinery capacity and strategic inventory stockpiling combined with declining domestic production were the major factors contributing to its recent increase in an average percent of china crude oil imports came from opec producing members
this declined from a peak of percent in while russia and brazil increased their market share of chinese imports more than any other country from nine to percent and from two to five percent respectively

opec countries and some countries including russia agreed to reduce crude oil production through the end of which allowed other countries to capture chinese market share in course in the past decade overreliance on saudi and opec oil has been offset in large part due to the wonders of the shale oil and gas boom that has seen saudi oil imports to the states reduced recently to lows not seen since the question now is will china find itself in the same foreign oil dependence quandary as the did from the early until the past decade
all signs indicate that the answer to this question is a resounding sheer size of china s economy its prolonged run of economic growth its massive population and its own oil and gas production problems create a scenario that will not only make beijing more reliant on oil from unstable or geopolitically volatile regions including iran nigeria saudi arabia and other opec producers but also from russia particularly pipeline oil and gas imports from that needs oil gasthese dynamics also point to the advantage that oil exports offer for not only china but the entire region
security of supply must be implemented into beijing s oil import mix strategy even if it is a tough pill to swallow for the country as it exchanges trade war barbs with only do shale oil and lng production offer enhanced security of supply as well as a sophisticated regulatory system and developed pipeline infrastructure there are also price incentives that are competitive over its oil and gas exporting starters the price spread between west texas intermediate wti crude oil and brent crude and other global benchmarks presents an incentive for china and others to procure more light sweet crude for its refineries
even if some of those refiners are not configured to process light grades it can be used as a blend with other crude types yielding higher profitable finished products like jet fuel gasoline kerosene and far as lng goes the fact that exported american lng is indexed to henry hub pricing is an also attractive selling point for supplies of the fuel
despite a recent pivot from longer tem lng contracts to shorter contracts and pure spot trading the fact remains that the bulk of lng volumes sold in the pacific region which accounts for of all global lng demand is still predominately tied to an pricing november china imported a record amount of crude oil from the some bpd admittedly a small market share in light of the million bpd of crude which the middle east imported that crude discount to brent will continue to drive more american oil particularly since that price spread is based on more barrels being pumped in the amid higher global oil prices which is projected to soon overtake russia as the world s top oil producer at million bpd
russia and opec members output for their part will likely hold steady or dip further if the production cut is extended past

oil production rose to a record million bpd in february the energy information administration eia said on price spreadon friday the price spread neared widening further to encourage producers to export crude to customers overseas
in march the spread stood at only per barrel
some of the price divergence not only comes from more output but geopolitical worries mostly from tensions in syria yemen and the ongoing jockeying for position in the region between riyadh and tehran even causing the saudis to consider a pivot in bilateral relations also putting upward pressure on brent and other benchmark meidan head analyst for asian energy policies and geopolitics at research consultancy energy aspects told cnbc late last year i think the certainly is poised to capture a lot of that growth
there is a huge amount of interest in crude to asia broadly but to china specifically
all of this comes full circle as beijing sends massive amounts of wealth to fill the coffers of foreign oil producers in essence helping in time to offset the trade imbalances with the and others and in effect helping these producers wrest by geopolitical and economic leverage away from tim daiss for top reads from
