is the oil supply glut set to return?
is the oil market tightening too much or is a glut on the verge of making a comeback there were a series of mixed messages from both opec and the iea in recent days offering a muddy outlook for the oil market
first was the tass interview with saudi oil minister khalid
his main message was that saudi arabia has enough spare capacity to cover for any shortfall related to iran although he noted that any further unexpected outages from say venezuela libya or nigeria would test the cartel s appears to be doing its part for now
mustafa sanalla the head of libya s national oil said that libya is aiming to increase production to million barrels per day by the end of which would mark the highest level since the arab spring and civil war began in remains confident that the market is
but separately he said that opec is in produce as much as you can meanwhile a technical committee working within opec suggested that it would prepare options for which could include a production cut in order to prevent a supply glut from
announced plans to increase production by million barrels per day in june but the deterioration of the global economy in recent weeks may require changing course the committee will big oil ever win back investors trust despite his confidence in the tass interview sounded a bit more concerned about too much supply when he spoke to saudi media admitting that he was worried about rising inventories
we have entered the stage of worrying about this increase said
indeed the has seen a sharp increase in inventories lately
crude stocks are up more than million barrels since the same time the international energy agency is concerned about not having enough supply on hand
the head of the agency urged opec to increase production in december when the group meets
global oil markets are going through a very sensitive period global economic growth as well iea executive director fatih birol said in a bloomberg interview in london thursday
if the oil producers care about the health of the growth of the global economy which i believe they do they should take the steps to further comfort the birol said that without more supply the global economy will enter a red birol conceded to s point that the oil market might be right now however the next few months might be difficult if the producers don t increase production or give the signal for it he russia s oil output won t go much highermeanwhile the head of the iea s oil division neil atkinson warned on twitter that supply outages are still a have already done a lot to ensure the market is well supplied but further likely falls in supply from venezuela and iran and ongoing uncertainty about libya mean that more will be needed if we are to avoid damage to the global economy
https oil market seems to be at a confusing juncture with supply outages and limited spare capacity threatening to send prices up which in turn would endanger the global economy
the flip side is that the market seems at least for now
rising inventories and a slowdown in demand might even amount to leading indicators of a returning supply the saudi oil minister s shift in tone was strategic coming in response to the recent fall in oil prices
hinting at a supply glut and possible opec action in response could jolt oil prices back up
after all iran sanctions are about to take effect which means supply is set to tighten in the next few weeks
thus the words of saudi representatives can be interpreted as a signal that the country regards a price level of approx
per barrel as comfortable and would target this price level commerzbank said in a note
this makes the oil price a political issue once again and as such can hardly be explained by fundamental developments alone
more pronounced price reactions to the daily news and increased volatility are therefore whether or not the oil market is out of balance either because of too much supply or because of too little is a matter of perspective
to some degree that is always the case but with so many mixed signals floating around the market the outlook seems especially perplexing right nick cunningham of top reads from
