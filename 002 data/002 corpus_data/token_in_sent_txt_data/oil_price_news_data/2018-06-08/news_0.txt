geopolitical tensions reach boiling point ahead of opec meeting
the upcoming opec meeting on june is shaping up to be a contentious one after news broke that the government asked saudi arabia to increase oil production before washington pulled out of the iran nuclear last week news surfaced that the government asked saudi arabia to boost output to relieve pressure on prices
but reuters followed up with a report on june adding more context to that story
according to reuters a high level trump administration official called saudi arabia a day before trump was set to announce the withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal asking for more oil supply to cover for disruptions from last time the government pressured opec into adding supply it was also over iran
the obama administration wanted the cartel to offset disrupted iranian production after an international coalition put stringent sanctions on iran in
roughly million barrels per day were knocked the trump administration s request might irk opec members with iran obviously the most aggrieved the apparent willingness of saudi arabia to comply with washington s request has ignited furor from within the it s crazy and astonishing to see instruction coming from washington to saudi to act and replace a shortfall of iran s export due to their illegal sanction on iran and venezuela iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili said in comments to reuters
he said that opec would not simply comply with washington s requests
no one in opec will act against two of its founder members he said referring to iran and venezuela
the tried it last time against iran but oil prices got to a opec will not accept such a humiliation
how arrogant and ignorant one could be to underestimate the history of years cooperation among competitors he wrote to opec members asking them to denounce sanctions a request similar to the one iran made recently
i kindly request solidarity and support from our fellow members venezuelan oil minister manuel quevedo wrote
the group should discuss the constraining effects of unilateral sanctions imposed by the united states of america which represent an extraordinary aggression financially and economically for our national oil industry s operations and the stability of the the comments suggest that a good portion of the cartel is lining up against any move to increase production
it could set the stage for a heated meeting in vienna in two weeks time
it might be one of the worst opec meetings since eugen weinberg of commerzbank told will saudi arabia listen to
demands for more oil he was referring to the infamous meeting that fell apart over sharp differences in opinion with saudi arabia wanting to increase production to ease oil prices following the conflagration in parts of north africa and the middle east during the arab spring
but the saudis were shot down by much of the rest of the group which opposed lifting output
former saudi oil minister ali said it was one of the worst meetings we have ever although not exactly the same the differences back then echo those of today
saudi arabia wary of hurting global economic growth and also cautious about not incentivizing too much supply wants to add some barrels back onto the about every opec member outside of the gulf is unable to increase production anyway so it is of little surprise that they are opposed to higher production
venezuela s output is falling fast
angola is also losing production
libya and nigeria seemed to have hit a temporary ceiling with security issues always looming as a supply risk
also they don t have official limits on their output as part of the opec deal so there is little upside for them in supporting production increases from other obviously is facing production outages from sanctions so it likely can t increase output even if it wanted to
officials from iraq and algeria made negative comments over the past week about the possibility of higher the camp mexico s production is falling anyway so it has little to no ability to respond to change in the only beneficiaries of higher production would be saudi arabia and russia and to a lesser extent some of the gulf states like kuwait and the oil kingdom in crisis saudi royal family rift turns violentbut saudi arabia and russia probably can t simply allot themselves more production allowances without risking a revolt from the rest of the group
so they will likely need to allocate more production to everyone but even the act of deciding on a formula will also be highly contentious
still it will be somewhat of a formality for most members since they can t increase production there are a few possibilities from the upcoming meeting
first saudi arabia and russia convince the group to agree to an increase in output and while everyone nominally is allowed to increase output a bit the two top producers make up the lion s share of the increase
that will require sacrifice from much of the group who won t be able to increase production and will have to stomach lower oil possibility is a breakdown in negotiations and saudi arabia and russia go their own way increasing output
or talks could breakdown and there is no change in output although with the upside risk to prices this seems the outcome odds are that the upcoming meeting is the most combative we have seen in a nick cunningham of top reads from
