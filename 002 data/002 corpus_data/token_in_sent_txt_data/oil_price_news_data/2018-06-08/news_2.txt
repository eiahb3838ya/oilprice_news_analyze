pullback in oil prices provides an opportunity
the amazing compliance from opec members and russia to production guidelines has drained the surplus from global supplies and brought oil prices up to trade in the s here in the and the s everywhere else
but the recent announcement from the saudis and russia promising a production increase of up to million barrels per day to limits that have been in place since december of has the oil markets taking a breath from their upwards march
for now the signals of more supply are weighing on the oil price with the meeting still almost two weeks fascinating dynamic between the three most important players here the us russia and the saudis is going to tell the real story of what the final outcome from the opec meeting will be and where oil prices are going to go from s analyze the motivations of all three and make a plan in the trump has tweeted his unhappiness with higher oil prices and there have been indications that he s gotten some concessions from opec to increase production and keep gas prices at a manageable level through the midterm the other side of the globe it s clear that russia has benefited enormously from higher oil prices but their loyalty to opec and the global supply chain is historically weak if there is a commitment for another barrels a day to be added to the production pot russia is going to lobby for a lot of that allocation for we have the saudis who at the very least need to look like they are helping president trump towards stable gas prices
after all the saudis were virulently opposed to the iranian nuclear deal and the president did deliver on his promise to abandon it and reinstate sanctions
however and this is a big caveat the saudis still must make their ipo of saudi aramco hugely successful if young prince muhammad bin salman is to survive and for that they ll need an even higher price for oil optimally over a what do i think will happen
the tightrope that the saudis need to walk is the key here delivering the impression of keeping oil prices lower yet still obtaining at least compliance on the original production deal through
by doing that they are assured that global stockpiles will still continue to drain if more slowly than they have for the past several months
bin salman and have shown a brilliant ability to walk these tightropes in the past year and a half and i expect them to successfully navigate it this one should expect oil prices to remain moderated up to the meeting date of june and with that oil stocks to remain moderately priced as well
it is possible the many will perceive the pressures of russia and the to be too much for the saudis predict the meeting will be a disaster and therefore sending oil stocks significantly lower immediately prior to see this as an bottlenecks in the permian shale play will finally cap oil increases there and with continued compliance assured by crafty saudi moves the oil price will again resume its steady creep higher in spite of president trump s angry us there remains the same strategy that we ve been following only now it should become more aggressive to accumulate cash by jettisoning permian shale producers and centering back into those more mature efs and bakken s that are less than hedged into the coming year
