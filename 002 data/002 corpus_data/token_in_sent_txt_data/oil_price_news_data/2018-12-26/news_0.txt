whatâ€™s in store for opec in 2019?
opec has come through some turbulent times in the last few years as oil prices fell to decade lows
it has implemented production cuts has rallied russia to climb onboard the production cut train has weathered the rise of us shale to highs has extended those production cuts has lifted production to quell a nervous market sanctions and then has managed to pull a rabbit out of a hat by agreeing to yet another production opec is not finished we approach the new year the opec is facing another set of challenges
here are some of the challenges they will face in manuel quevedo opec s leadership is crucial to its success
it operates under a rotating presidency and for that honor is bestowed upon none other than venezuela s manuel quevedo has zero oil industry experience taking over venezuela s pdvsa and oil minister of the nation which is pretty much the same thing
instead quevedo s experience is with the military serving as national guard major general prior to his position as czar in a country that is falling apart at the seams
quevedo was appointed in late to right the wrong ship that is was given extra s call it a special create annul or modify deals involving pdvsa its subsidiaries
his reign dispensed with nearly pdvsa executives in a massive sweep that some have labeled a mere power grab despite maduro s insistence to the has been so far unable to right the ship with venezuela s oil production and oil revenues falling at unprecedented rates even when oil prices rallied
quevedo has instead instilled fear into pdvsa workers and has implemented some policies that some argue have brought pdvsa closer further brink of maduro loyalist through and through quevedo will now take over not only pdvsa and venezuela s oil industry but will assume the rotating presidency of the most influential oil industry body in the world
but his lack of experience is only part of the trouble
opec has been the target of tweets by us president donald to that president trump s vehement opposition to subject of us opec may find itself even more of a target
the worst thing for opec would be for venezuela s tenuous relationship with washington to mar opec s already tenuous relationship with ubs expect brent next yearquevedo is also strongly backing el alleged has supposedly been invited by opec to speak about the rise of el petro sometime in another hurdle opec faces in is the proposed us legislation that would allow legal claims against opec for manipulating oil prices called the no oil producing and exporting cartels act nopec in opec advised its members to stop referring to oil prices specifically instead urging them to use phrases such as balanced market and the like
opec s preemptive strike speaks to the plausibility that this legislation could be passed as president donald trump s strained relationship with opec plays out on twitter and in the legislative walked out of opec just one month ago potentially distancing itself from this legislation that if passed would open up a whole can of legal issues for the cartel as it would end laws revoking the sovereign immunity that until now has protected opec members from legal actions regarding price libya managed to secure an exemption from the opec production cuts that will go into effect on january allegedly due to its unstable oil production that ebbs and flows as infighting continues to batter its oil industry like a plague
but this exemption and its chronic outages of its largest oilfield sharara poses a challenge to opec who is struggling to balance production with demand
as libya s production increases and decreases opec has difficulty responding immediately to offset the ebbs and flows and no single country has been least not to our increase or decrease production to offset libya s production
the unknowns with libya create an unknown for all of et al the signees of the deal to cut production expose opec to a greater risk
opec needs heavyweight russia on board with the production cuts
russia has agreed to cut production along with several other lesser producers
but it has also said that it will be a gradual production cut beginning in january but not reaching full cut volumes until march
here russia holds some sway exacerbated by its cozy relationship with venezuela and major general quevedo who has been the recipient of substantial loans courtesy of russia s generosity
opec has recruited russia out of necessity and being in bed with russia exposes opec to greater risks
should russia renege on the deal with opec the production cut agreement would be largely toothless
related canada s lng dream just turned into a nightmarespeculators oil prices still respond to opec chatter leaked information statements to the press and monthly production figures that either show opec s success in hitting professed production targets
but the latter half of saw the beginning of a partial immunity to such news and as the oil market continues its recently acquired anxiety disorder is unlikely to look much different
what opec could previously achieve with a mere promise to curb production or increase production will now be met with increasing don t tell will be the new norm for the oil market as traders work against opec albeit shale the united states shale industry has been a thorn in opec s side since the cartel s initial pump oil until we crush them policy rolled out prior to its first round of production cuts in
the rise of us shale will continue to be so throughout as production increases continue unabated
unlike opec members us shale producers are only inhibited by price and even that has proven to be a nondeterrent to increasing production
for every barrel that opec doesn t produce oil producers in the united states will happily export in its stead
the united states entry as top dog when it comes to oil production at million bpd toward the end of has taken much wind out of opec s sails making it more difficult for opec to manipulate the market
this will continue throughout will have an uphill battle in but its influence as a cartel should not be dismissed entirely
the oil market in will be largely affected by not by opec as other major players rise to sway the market as julianne geiger for top reads from
