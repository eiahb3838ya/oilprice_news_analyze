europe becomes victim of russia’s newest oil strategy
higher shipments of russian crude oil to china may saddle european importers with a fatter bill an industry consultancy warned at the end of last year noting the latest stage of russia s eastern pivot the launch of the expanded east ocean pipeline that would lift urals crude supply to china twofold to million tons annually
fge said in a note quoted by bloomberg that russia will start moving more urals eastward right after the launch of the pipeline extension at a rate of bpd
the overall increase of russian crude shipments to china according to the consultancy could be around bpd
this means less oil for europe which is russia s oil client
this only highlights the significance of moscow s asian pivot amid lingering european sanctions following the annexation of crimea and russia s involvement in separatist conflicts in the ukraine
in russia exported an average million barrels daily to european countries compared with less than a million bpd to china according to figures from the energy information administration eia
in percentage figures europe accounted for percent of russia s crude oil exports while the share of china was just percent
yet this is changing fast as this chart from the eia shows click to enlarge the rise in chinese exports has been quite steep since as of november last year russia shipped million barrels of oil daily to china
all the latest signs point to further growth
however exactly how much this would hurt european buyers is unclear
related renewable energy on the rise in electricity generationthe urals is currently trading at a discount of about to brent crude but wti s discount to the international benchmark is a barrel
in other words russia s diverting of crude oil from europe to china could be an opportunity for exporters as long as they can keep their transport costs low enough
europe will probably be grateful for the diversification
over the long term things are even more uncertain
clearly russia has prioritized its relationship with china in addition to the espo expansion gazprom is on track to complete the power of siberia gas pipeline by
the mammoth of a pipeline will pump trillion cu ft of gas to china annually
the country is already the consumer of natural gas in the world behind the and russia and is expected to show the strongest demand growth over the coming it to second place by as the economy shifts away from coal
this soaring demand has already created shortages in parts of the country
a recent report by eurasia daily suggested the power of siberia will be essential in avoiding future gas shortages
would that take gas away from europe
it s unlikely given gazprom s market share in europe and besides there s enough gas for everyone
what might happen is china overtaking europe as russia s biggest gas export market at some point in the future especially if relations continue to be strained
