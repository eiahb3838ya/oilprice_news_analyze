argentina is on the cusp of a shale boom
the end of the peronist hold on argentine politics and rise of president mauricio macri has heralded in a new age for what was long regarded as one of the most economically unstable nations in latin former buenos aires mayor and businessman won the presidency in ousting his mercurial populist peronist predecessor cristina fern√°ndez de kirchner
since coming to power macri has worked to restructure a shattered economy ruined by decades of market warping tariffs and subsidies protectionism heavy handed regulation rampant inflation and unsustainable fiscal president has been able to achieve what no one thought possible halving inflation from what independent sources claimed had reached as high as a percent to near a more manageable percent
this helped stimulate economic growth by stabilizing the financial system and allowing the to borrow again
this along with macri dismantling stringent currency exchange and capital controls has reinvigorated the interest of foreign investors in the latin american helped power the biggest stock market boom in the world with the argentine bourse rising by an incredible percent in value during
that trend should continue as macri focuses on rebuilding argentina s energy industry and seeks to capitalize on the nation s enormous unconventional oil and gas of macri s most significant achievements was ending the complex system of domestic oil tariffs and subsidies introduced by the kirchner administration
these distorted local prices led to considerable underinvestment in the energy industry and saw argentina become a net energy importer despite its tremendous unconventional oil and gas rewards are substantial considering that argentina s technically recoverable shale oil reserves come to billion barrels which is of the country s technically recoverable crude
the vaca muerta formation is rated by the eia as having the unconventional oil and gas reserves globally
this resource s potential becomes real as oil majors such as royal dutch shell nyse and exxonmobil are rushing to scoop up the best acreage
a top exxonmobil executive believes once the prolific vaca muerta shale reaches peak production argentina and the will be responsible for around a third of global natural gas production
related clean oil that only costs s largest energy company ypf nyse ypf has committed to investing billion over the next five years as it moves to exploit the potential of the vaca muerta and attempts to emulate the shale oil and gas boom domestically
that won t be enough however because ypf on its own lacks the expertise capital and workforce to access argentina s vast reserves making foreign investment particularly important if argentina is to realize its full energy attract that investment macri has reduced labor costs and implemented favorable price subsidies for natural gas obtained from unconventional sources
prices for natural gas obtained from unconventional production have a guaranteed price floor of per million british thermal units mmbtu for with them winding down by annually to per mmbtu by
that s more than double the current spot price and in a market where natural gas prices have been depressed for years it s attracting significant interest from international energy the end of exxonmobil nyse xom announced that it planned to invest million in the vaca muerta seeking a unconventional production concession in the los toldos i sur block
the integrated energy major stated earlier that it intends to invest over billion in unconventional projects in the region over the next early royal dutch shell also sealed a deal with ypf to invest million in the vaca muerta and previously announced plans to invest that amount annually in the formation up until
one of the pioneers of investing in argentina s unconventional oil and gas industry chevron nyse cvx has committed to investing million in partnership with ypf during significant investments from some of the biggest names in the industry bodes well for argentina to unlock the massive potential that its unconventional oil and gas formations it won t all been plain sailing
related is history repeating itself in oil markets poor infrastructure in the regions where most of argentina s oil and gas resources are located along with costly logistics will also weigh on whether argentina can tap into its vast energy resources
then there s potential conflict with the mapuche indians an indigenous group spanning argentina and chile that has recently become more aggressive about reclaiming tribal oil prices and the latest slump in crude will weigh on investment decisions by energy companies for some time to come
during argentina s rig count plummeted to a low of active rigs in april its lowest number since as the prolonged oil slump saw energy companies curb expenditure causing production to fall to its lowest level in the latest data shows that the rig count for january climbed to and will move higher as investment in argentina s energy patch grows
that will cause production to rise
energy industry consultancy wood mackenzie forecast that production from the vaca muerta alone will grow to barrels daily or more than percent higher than and double line argentina is on the cusp of emerging from decades of economic instability and is in the process of shedding its status as a pariah state among investors to become one of the hottest destinations for foreign energy investors as the policies of macri gain greater matthew smith for top reads from
