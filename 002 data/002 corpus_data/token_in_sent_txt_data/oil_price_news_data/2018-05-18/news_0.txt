is $70 oil enough for shale drillers?
wti crude prices have recently surged to their highest level in three and a half above a barrel
in theory that s higher than the average breakeven costs of all key shale plays
even wti is higher than the average breakeven prices as per the latest quarterly dallas fed energy survey from shale producers are not necessarily raking in huge profits although was their best start to a year in three are constrained by pipeline bottlenecks in the permian higher costs for drilling services some bad hedging bets capping part of company sales at below market prices the huge discount of wti midland crude to wti and brent due to said bottlenecks amid soaring production and investment in more drilling
shale producers face takeaway bottlenecks in the permian which is widening the wti midland crude discount to wti crude
so the prices at which producers sell their oil is not the same as the one we see on the oil price even as falling inventories and geopolitical risks put upward pressure on benchmark crude spot prices tightening constraints on crude oil transport are increasingly driving a wedge between the brent global crude benchmark and crude priced in the permian basin the dallas fed said in its may energy indicators the discount between brent crude and wti barrels priced in midland increased from an average of in the first half of to an average of in the second half
congested takeaway capacity from the permian has further widened the discount in
that spread averaged in largest monthly spread between the two since september the eia also flagged the rapidly widening spread in its latest energy outlook from may
related oil exports continue to break records as production grows beyond the capacity of existing pipeline infrastructure producers must use more expensive forms of transportation including rail and trucks
as a result wti midland price spreads widened to the largest discount to brent since
the wti midland differential to brent settled at on may which represents a widening of since april the eia addition companies have increased investment in drilling more in the permian and even in the bakken so their positive cash positions have not boomed in lockstep with the rallying wti oil companies are just not generating enough cash to fund all of their investment in new wells james williams energy economist at wtrg economics told marketwatch s myra but the cash flows in over time after you spend the money on drilling the well williams of the top oil firms focused on shale drilling were still spending in more cash than they were making according to an analysis by the wall street journal based on factset data
of those companies just five generated more cash than they spent in according to the wsj even if prices are now higher than the average breakevens across the major basins cost inflation is back with a vengeance and shale companies expect a cost jump this year while there is also a shortage of fracking crews and truck drivers in parts of the some shale producers have been booking losses from hedging after they hedged part of their production at and a barrel wti which caps part of their gains when prices rally well above that level
hedging contracts capped at or below are now a drag on company sales instead of the lifeline they were during the oil price these companies aren t exposed to the higher prices because many of them hedged their oil production at per barrel matt badiali senior research analyst at banyan hill told oil prices surely help producers but they still have work to do to turn the higher prices assuming they are sustainable into higher tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
