softer u.s. gasoline demand weighs on oil prices
the latest oil price decline has been blamed on several things including anxiety about the state of the global economy the sanction waivers washington granted iran s biggest crude oil buyers and of course oil production in the shale patch
but while all these were indeed factors pressuring prices one other factor has been a strong headwind but has stayed out of the spotlight gasoline john kemp brought into the spotlight this week citing a report from the energy information administration that found gasoline consumption in the world s largest user of crude oil remained flat on the year over the first ten months of
that s right gasoline consumption did not move between january and october last year despite an economy firing on all cylinders and a three season plus relatively low prices for much of the average daily consumption of the fuel kemp reports hovered around million barrels
this was bpd lower than the average for
what s more the eia expects gasoline consumption to have declined by bpd over the data suggests is attributable less to any economic growth patterns and more to a consistent decline in traffic growth kemp notes adding that there are two chief factors at play when it comes to growth in traffic the economy and oil prices
while the former the reuters analyst goes on has been positive for traffic growth this has not been the case with oil prices for much of the last years and that has discouraged traffic growth over the long term
related seeks to cripple venezuela s vehicle for embezzlement yet in the past slow traffic growth was not accompanying by a booming shale oil industry
in its latest energy outlook the eia estimated crude oil production to have expanded by million bpd in from the previous year to million bpd
towards the end of the year production ramped up to more than million bpd
most of this production is light crude the kind of crude that is refined into this month reuters reported excess supply of gasoline in the united states coupled with slow demand has pressured refiners margins noting refining margins for the fuel in the sank to us a barrel last week
the drop followed the fourth weekly increase in gasoline inventories in the country all of them quite hefty leading to an high of gasoline supplies at million barrels as of january
over the four weeks to january the energy information administration reported that gasoline inventory builds reached a combined million that s quite a build in gasoline inventories and provides useful context for price movements
these are unlikely to become a lot more lively this year despite opec s cuts and this time it won t be gasoline consumption driving them
it will be the global economy and former according to an earlier report by kemp would determine oil demand growth the extent of the slowdown depends on whether global growth starts to accelerate again settles into an extended soft patch or falls into an outright recession
the difference between each of these three scenarios amounts to several hundred thousand barrels per day bpd of consumption growth dwarfing all other influences on oil prices in the latter relations are going nowhere it seems
just when reports on the topic began to turn more optimistic the indicted chinese electronics conglomerate huawei on charges of industrial espionage violations of the iranian sanctions money laundering and bank fraud
naturally this did not sit well with beijing which called the charges unfair and politically refiners will in all likelihood be forced to continue overproducing gasoline as they increase their middle distillates production in response to growing this demand remain growing of the overhang in gasoline will stay and continue to keep a lid on prices
this is good news for drivers but whether it will be good enough for a pickup in traffic remains to be irina slav for top reads from
