the major risk that oil markets are underestimating
the campaign for regime change in venezuela could drive up oil oil markets barely budged last week when the trump administration first recognized juan gauidó as president of venezuela and prices hardly moved even after reporting showed that the effort to topple nicolas maduro was a lot more coordinated than it may have seemed at first glance
oil prices also largely shrugged when american sanctions on pdvsa were announced earlier this by tuesday oil traders finally woke up to the fact that the campaign to topple maduro by essentially issuing an embargo on venezuelan oil exports could lead to major disruptions in the market
wti and brent both rose as sanctions simply bar american entities from doing business with pdvsa the measures could wreak havoc on venezuelan oil exports
refiners import around bpd of venezuelan oil
american sanctions also dictate that any revenues from oil sales would be put into an escrow to be managed by the government of juan gauidó
maduro would obviously not want to fund his opposition so oil exports to the will essentially cease going shipments can be rerouted to other buyers around the world but pdvsa will have to endure a heavy discount
even then there are only so many refiners capable of processing venezuela s heavy oil

to date pdvsa has been importing diluent from the that will no longer be allowed so it is unclear how venezuela will manage this disruption
if venezuela fails to find a substitute oil production will have to be scaled back commerzbank wrote in a top of that venezuela s shipments to the were the only ones that earned the country hard currency
the bulk of its shipments elsewhere mainly to china and russia are sent as repayment for past loans
in other words pdvsa does not take in cash for its oil shipments to those countries
presumably additional shipments to china russia or india in lieu of the lost market in the gulf coast could be sold for cash but maduro s government is without leverage which means the discounts will be is also a power struggle underway to take control of pdvsa
maduro still has control but the jockeying for control of both the operations and the bank accounts may throw up unexpected disruptions
the company is already in serious out over the some of the analysis around the crisis in venezuela has been described as bearish for oil prices since a new government could end the mismanagement of pdvsa and revive oil production in relatively short order
but that is magical thinking
even in the event of a peaceful transition of government we would not expect rapid growth in the output of venezuelan crude in the near term it is likely to take years to stabilize output let alone reverse declines standard chartered analysts led by paul horsnell wrote in a note
for refiners the disruption could be significant
as standard chartered points out the importance of venezuelan oil comes down to the quality and proximity of the heavy crude rather than the volume
venezuelan oil has some of the lowest degree of potential substitutability by other crude oils the investment bank offers one of the few alternatives but is constrained by a lack of pipelines
canada itself has had to incur production because of a shortage of pipeline space
in any event canadian oil largely flows to the midwest and as such can not really replace missing barrels on the gulf coast

treasury secretary steven mnuchin did not appeared worried about the potential outages in venezuela noting that many of our friends in the middle east will be happy to make up the his confidence could be misplaced
the burned some bridges last year with its friends in the middle east by demanding that they increase oil production in the wake of sanctions on iran only to issue a bunch of waivers leading to a crash in oil prices
riyadh probably won t be as trusting this time saudi oil minister khalid said this week that saudi arabia would lower its oil production to million barrels per day in february and keep it at that level for the duration of the deal
so far there are no signs that the saudis have a desire to help out washington result could be significant upward pressure on oil prices
the expected decline in venezuelan oil production and the problems in libya will make it easier for opec albeit inadvertently to rebalance the oil market by cutting production commerzbank nick cunningham of top reads from
