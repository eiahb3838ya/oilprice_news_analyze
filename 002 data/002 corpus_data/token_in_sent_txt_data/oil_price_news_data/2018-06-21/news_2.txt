nafta rift could be a boon for canadian oil
looming trade wars have made frequent headlines since the election of president donald trump
his view on the position in global trade is that for too long the country has been the piggy bank of the this has put some strain on relations with trading partners
trump s belligerent language and willingness to make use of the disproportionate influence in global economics through its financial and monetary system has upset markets and partners
one area of attention is nafta
although partners canada and mexico have been startled by the change of attitude of the towards the trade agreement the negotiations could also provide an china is the largest trading partner of the when measured in value the total economic activity between nafta s members is far greater
trade between canada and the reached a total of billion in with a small surplus of billion for the
regardless of these numbers an unprecedented clash occurred between the partners during and after the summit of and june concerning the planned tariffs on canadian by president trump s strong language canada mexico and the have been renegotiating nafta
in the case of canada these talks are an opportunity to change certain aspects of the agreement concerning the crucial hydrocarbons sector
more specifically the preferential access of the to the energy resources of its northern neighbour which is a major impediment for canadian policy and energy security
canadian export faces strategic restrictions as the overwhelming amount of oil is produced in landlocked alberta
the absence of sufficient infrastructure to either the east or west coast and existing pipelines to the south mean that the majority of produced oil is sent to the related opec meeting could end without decisionaccording to the proportionality clause article canada has to reserve a fixed ratio of its hydrocarbons production for export to customers regardless of domestic needs or federal policy
this effectively gives american companies considerable control over canada s resources
under the deal percent of all oil produced and imported and percent of gas needs to be exported to the means that even under exceptional circumstances such as the boycott of by arab countries canadian oil earmarked for export could not be diverted for domestic purposes
due to a lack of transportation options between east and west and the proportionality clause most of the oil in eastern canada is imported
in around barrels a day came from several sources costing around billion per year
related the permian faces shut ins due to oil pipeline shortagethe currently is the destination for percent of canada s oil exports
this gives washington and american producers a major strategic advantage as producers do not have many options
the price of west canadian select usually trades for to dollars a barrel less than the new york traded west texas intermediary due to quality differences and transportation costs
earlier this year that had risen to a barrel but the difference has somewhat decrease need for additional markets has increased due to two reasons
first the shale revolution has dramatically increased the production of oil in the which hit million bpd in april
next to that canadian oil production is expected to rise with an additional million bpd from currently to million bpd in
a combination of decreasing demand rising production and increased domestic output requires additional destination politicians and other stakeholders have been lobbying to revitalize the energy east pipeline that would transport oil from alberta to the eastern shores of canada
it would greatly reduce the dependency on the international markets and increase the share of domestic consumption
obviously the latter has consequences for the preferential access of companies to canadian oil as the share of export to the south would the west as early as houston based kinder morgan started with the planning and construction of a second part of the trans mountain pipeline to triple capacity from alberta to the shores of british columbia for transpacific export
however the decentralized political system british colombia s strong disapproval of the construction of the pipeline and the uncertain regulatory environment led to the withdrawal of the company and the temporary nationalization of the the government of justin trudeau has received a lot of criticism for bailing out the company and its unfinished multibillion dollar project the pipeline could significantly improve canada s position on the negotiating table
by providing producers alternative options and markets at least in part negative developments for the canadian energy sector can be mitigated by supplementing supply and demand of different regions
furthermore extra capacity is a bargaining chip in the hand of canada s negotiators the as the proportionality clause is a serious impediment for the oil vanand meliksetian for top reads from
