where do oil markets go after the opec deal?
lately oil markets have been finely balanced
both the bulls and bears can make a compelling argument for their respective cases
russia has vowed not to flood the oil markets while the compliance rates remain high
inventories have fallen
prices touched post highs at a barrel brent and a barrel wti
bears peddle the clichéd yet not at all insignificant story of iea in its recent report said that oil production could reach mbpd this year
rigs are being added across the country taking the total number of oil rigs to its highest level since april
much of the current situation is thanks to the vienna deal that saved oil prices after they tanked below might ask what will become of the markets after the deal expires
in other words how long can the producers continue to cap output
with a rising production and the possibility that one day and that day might come very soon the oil producers will open their taps anew
on top of that the lack of any drastic upbeat demand figures makes a bearish case for oil more than can be given to the technological improvements and resilience of shale producers that kept pumping oil even when prices were low
but the vienna accord spearheaded and held together by saudi arabia and russia still managed to raise oil prices
both opec and russia have their interests in maintaining a healthy oil price
for every one dollar oil prices fall russia loses billion in revenue
opec s leader saudi arabia needs higher oil prices to ensure the successful ipo of aramco
for these reasons the deal was extended last year until the end of
there are chances it might be extended further but how much one can make an educated guess that the current production cuts can certainly hold until aramco s ipo which is a huge bet on the country s future
once the ipo is done we might expect weakness in the saudi resolve to continue the deal
russian executives are also losing year in november many energy industry executives expressed their concern regarding rising shale production
it remains to be seen for how long they can allow others to free ride on their efforts
the iea reported that the will be a net exporter of oil and gas by
revising its estimates it said that production will touch mbpd this year earlier estimates suggested this wouldn t happen until analysts expect oil prices to rise this yearother opec members are also gearing up to produce again
after signs of tightening oil markets countries like kuwait uae and iraq have expressed their ambitions to increase production once the deal expires
kuwait s oil minister said that the country will raise its production from mbpd to mbpd by end of march
iraq aims to edge up production to mbpd from mbpd by year s end and iran says it might add bpd after the deal expires
we can be certain that russians will increase production as members meet in june for a review meeting
inventory levels are still above the moving average showing that they have work to do but some members may be tempted for an early
mamdouh salameh international oil economist and world bank consultant on oil energy is positive about oil prices
he says oil market fundamentals are positive enough to sustain an oil price ranging from in
by this i mean that the global economy is projected to grow by percent in and compared with percent in according to the imf
the global demand for oil is projected to add million barrels a day mbd this year over dr
salameh was very upbeat when discussing the strength of the commitment between russia and saudi arabia saying that opec and russia have suffered a great ordeal with the steep decline of oil prices since
that is why they never want to suffer that experience to rely on a single deal that limits production from certain members is not a good idea
not to mention the fact that the production cuts continue to face challenges in the shape of rising production offsetting the effects
there is only one way to get out of this vicious circle of supply and price imf says that the world economy will witness growth this year
eurozone economy is also picking up
demand is also expected from india and china
electrification of transport and policy changes supporting climate change are other factors to consider
the transportation sector is a major consumer of oil
china with the biggest car fleet in the world plans to ban conventional cars by
france india and other countries are recent talks about forming an opec super group a marriage between opec and russia has uplifted the sentiments again
however it remains to be seen whether russia will go along with this plan
even if it does the fact remains that such deals can not be a permanent solution for stabilizing oil threat from the is real and production cuts are not a long term solution to stabilize oil osama rizvi for top reads from
