saldanha bay in south africa is home to one of the world largest crude storage facilities with a current capacity of million barrels although more is coming online later in the year
an article published last september said that various trading houses were selling crude from the storage hub after the market had flipped into backwardation when prices are higher than those further into the future disincentivizing crude storage be it onshore or offshore aka floating storage that time crude leaving the storage terminal was as elusive as the loch ness monster

after exports averaged bbls a month through the first ten months of november export loadings jumped tenfold to million bbls
this was swiftly followed by strength in december this time of million bbls
just as quickly as exports popped their head up they disappeared again
we have seen no further export loadings out of saldanha bay since leaving our chart to look reminiscent of the aforementioned nessy

although it has more than halved since year we still see around million barrels of crude waiting offshore in the matt smithmore top reads from
