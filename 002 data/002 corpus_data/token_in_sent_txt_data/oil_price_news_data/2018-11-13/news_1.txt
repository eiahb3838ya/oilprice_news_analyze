could brazil's oil sector trigger an economic miracle?
brazil s new president elect jair bolsonaro dubbed in some circles as the trump of the tropics has huge plans in store for brazilian crude
his energy team is planning a massive push for the sale of brazil s enormous crude deposits to foreign investors
this is a move that would potentially open up a staggering quantity of oil bigger than all of mexico s proven reserves to big oil and other private s new strategies and political recruits represent a major shift in political ideology for the veteran politician
before running for president bolsonaro was largely in favor of state control and as a retired military officer himself the president elect continues to be close to extremely nationalist military leaders
now the political figure has changed his tune winning the brazilian presidency on a platform of and a promise to brazil s economic doors to foreign all goes according to plan bolsonaro s energy team would be taking bids as early as as part of an initiative to raise some of the billions of dollars needed to pull brazil out of crushing debt and to address the massive and budget deficit
it is estimated that brazilian crude sales could potentially raise up to billion reais billion usd if next year s sale is approved by senate this week
the bill was introduced months ago but had previously been stalled in congress because of the contentious and volatile presidential be clear this would by no means be the first sale of brazilian crude open to foreign interests it s actually the country bid round and sixth subsalt auction but it is in many ways the first of its kind
unlike previous auctions of brazilian crude which offered exploration rights to high risk areas with no guarantee of commercial reserves the sale to take place in would be for an area that has already been home to major discoveries by brazil s state oil company petroleo brasileiro sa petrobras
in fact the area is located within brazil s massive reserves offshore in the atlantic ocean

this surplus is what will be offered to oil majors in the coming year if bolsonaro s plan is met with success and could amount to as much as billion barrels a truly staggering bill that would authorize the sale currently waiting to be voted upon by the brazilian senate would also remove the obligation placed on petrobras to develop the entire offshore region on its own
this measure is a holdover from the leftist workers party that led brazil for years until during which time they maintained that brazilian oil was a strategic resource that should be kept out of foreign investors hands and under domestic fact after many years of pushing back against privatization brazil now has more enterprises soes than any other nation in the americas even prompting forbes to label it the china of latin america as brazil s debt edges closer to a whopping percent of its gdp and the people have shown their desire for a new direction by electing a president it looks like the winds of change and big sales are about to sweep through the south american nation
selling off soes to private investors is the strategy the undesirable alternative being extreme cuts on entitlement spending
