canada is by far the largest supplier of heavy crude to refiners and mexico is also a large exporter to its neighbor in the the political situation is venezuela continues to deteriorate after the president of the national assembly which the maduro government does not recognize declared himself interim president and the last elections illegal
president trump was quick to recognize the opposition leader juan guaido as the legitimate president of this month reports emerged that washington was once again considering a blanket oil import ban on venezuelan crude following maduro s inauguration
at the time experts weighed in skeptically saying this could lead to a pretty sharp increase in gasoline prices which would make the measure unpopular
so far however there is no official word of oil the meantime venezuela is being rocked by protests and guaido has called for more people to take to the streets to topple maduro
the call came on the heels of an ultimatum from the european union for caracas to set a date for new elections
at the same time maduro has publicly demonstrated he has the support of the army with a round of military exercises amidst the protests
