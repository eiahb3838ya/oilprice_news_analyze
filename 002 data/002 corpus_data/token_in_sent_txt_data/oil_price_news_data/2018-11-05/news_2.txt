washington issues waivers, warns against trading oil with iran
almost six months after washington announced its withdrawal from the jcpoa deal the formally sanctions on iran as of today
in a press conference secretary of state mike pompeo announced that the following countries have received temporary waivers allowing them to continue to import iranian crude koreataiwanturkeygreecejapanchinaindiaitalyseveral other european nations that asked to be exempted did not get a waiver
secretary of state mike pompeo has also implicitly warned india and china that there would be consequences if the two countries continue to buy iranian oil after the sanctions against tehran went into effect watch the iranians
that is who really understands the actions we are taking pompeo told fox news in an interview on sunday
in response to a question about whether washington can make sure china and india will eventually stop importing iranian oil pompeo said chris wallace watch what we do
watch as we already taken more crude oil off the market than any time in previous history
watch the efforts that president trump policies have achieved
we done all of this too chris while making sure that american consumers do although this is far from anything specific the comments come a couple of days after russia s energy minister alexander novak told the financial times that russia will continue to buy iranian crude and help tehran sell it abroad
because of this timing some saw in pompeo s words a thinly veiled warning to russia as well
related why trump decided to back down on iran we believe we should look for mechanisms that would allow us to continue developing with our partners with iran novak told the russia buys iranian crude under an swap deal inked in and then resells it to other countries
when asked by the ft if there were plans to expand the volume of oil traded novak said moscow will first assess the effects of the sanctions before making a decision on s comments are certainly in tune with the general sentiment in washington but they might not reflect the reality of the decline in iranian exports
the latest data suggests the drop in exports between may and september has not been that great
of course since september things might have thing has changed for certain in late october all iranian tankers turned off their geolocation devices the afp reported citing meaning a lot of oil could be headed abroad but this won t become immediately evident
if this becomes evident it would certainly undermine the upbeat mood and probably lead to an even more hawkish stance by irina slav for top reads from
