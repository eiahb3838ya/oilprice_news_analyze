new breakthrough will change how oil reserves are measured
a massachusetts institute of technology team of researchers has taken the first images of kerogen s internal structure with a level of detail more than times greater than has been previously achieved
the images should allow more accurate predictions of how much oil or gas can be recovered from any given fossil fuels that provide much of the world s energy originate in a type of rock known as kerogen and the potential for recovering these fuels depends crucially on the size and connectedness of the rocks internal pore spaces

click image for the largest new images should allow more accurate predictions of how much oil or gas can be recovered from any given formation
but this wouldn t change the capability for recovering these fuels but it could for example lead to better estimates of the recoverable reserves of natural gas which is seen as an important transition fuel as the world tries to curb the use of coal and findings have been published in the proceedings of the national academy of science in a paper by mit senior research scientist roland pellenq mit professor ulm and others at mit cnrs and universit√© amu in france and shell technology center in team which published results two years ago on an investigation of kerogen pore structure based on computer simulations used a relatively new method called electron tomography to produce the new images which have a resolution of less than nanometer or billionth of a meter
previous attempts to study kerogen structure had never imaged the material below nanometers resolution pellenq fuels as their name suggests form when organic matter such as dead plants gets buried and mixed with silt
as these materials get buried deeper over millions of years the mix gets cooked into a mineral matrix interspersed with a mix of molecules
over time with more heat and pressure the nature of that complex structure goldman oil prices set for rebound in process a slow pyrolysis involves cooking oxygen and hydrogen and at the end you get a piece of charcoal pellenq explains
but in between you get this whole gradation of molecules many of them useful fuels lubricants and chemical new results show for the first time a dramatic difference in the nanostructure of kerogen depending on its age
relatively immature kerogen whose actual age depends of the combination of temperatures and pressures it has been subjected to tends to have much larger pores but almost no connections among those pores making it much harder to extract the fuel
mature kerogen by contrast tends to have much tinier pores but these are in a network that allow the gas or oil to flow easily making much more of it recoverable pellenq study also reveals that the typical pore sizes in these formations are so small that normal hydrodynamic equations used to calculate the way fluids move through porous materials won t work
at this scale the material is in such close contact with the pore walls that interactions with the wall dominate its behavior
the research team thus had to develop new ways of calculating the flow there s no fluid dynamics equation that works in these subnanoscale pores he said
no continuum physics works at that to get these detailed images of the structure the team used electron tomography in which a small sample of the material is rotated within the microscope as a beam of electrons probes the structure to provide at one angle after another
these are then combined to produce a full reconstruction of the pore structure
while scientists had been using the technique for a few years they hadn t applied it to kerogen structures until now
the imaging was carried out at the cinam lab of cnrs and amu in france in the group of daniel ferry as part of a collaboration with multiscale materials science for energy and environment the joint lab located at oil puts shale to the test with this new nanoscale tomography we can see where the hydrocarbon molecules are actually sitting inside the rock pellenq said
once they obtained the images the researchers were able to use them together with molecular models of the structure to improve the fidelity of their simulations and calculations of flow rates and mechanical properties
this could shed light on how production rates decline in oil and gas wells and perhaps on how to slow that far the team has studied samples from three different kerogen locations and found a strong correlation between the maturity of the formation and its pore size distribution and pore void connectivity
the researchers now hope to expand the study to many more sites and to derive a robust formula for predicting pore structure based on a given site s is highly interesting work
of all the oil and gas discovered so far less than half has been recovered and marketed
those reservoirs are found infrastructure installed and connected to markets
secondary and tertiary recovery are already very big businesses one has to wonder if the big private petroleum firms may or may not be at this point or beyond
these firms hire the best petroleum engineers in the world and petroleum engineers are all very bright folks the research is offering out in the open real basic information and importantly new energy and fuelmore top reads from
