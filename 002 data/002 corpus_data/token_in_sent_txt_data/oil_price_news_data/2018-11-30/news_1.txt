the saudi dilemma: to cut or not to cut
to cut and push up prices or not to cut and preserve market share this is the question that saudi arabia is facing ahead of this year s december opec meeting
it seems like just yesterday when opec met in and decided to cut production by million barrels daily including from russia to reverse the free fall of oil prices
at the time it worked because everyone was desperate
now many opec members are both desperate while not yet recovered from the blow
saudi arabia is not an recent report from capital economics said saudi arabia has its problems but it could withstand lower oil prices without feeling too much of a pinch
even if brent prices fall further to a barrel immediate balance of payments strains are unlikely to emerge the report said with its authors adding the kingdom would be able to finance its trade deficit from its foreign exchange reserves for at least a this suggestion is not universally accepted
reuters john kemp this week offered a different perspective in his regular column on oil noting saudi arabia s foreign exchange reserves currently stand at us billion down from nearly us billion in when the oil prices slumped under the weight of shale oil
at the same time saudi arabia is in a major push to diversify its revenue streams and has committed a lot of money to kemp wrote the kingdom probably needs to keep several hundred billion dollars worth of reserve assets on hand to maintain confidence in its fixed peg to the dollar and prevent a run on the it s a classic rock and a hard place situation for the saudis
on the one hand they could continue pumping at the current record rate or close to it pressuring prices further which is what they did in
that strategy hurt shale substantially but the attempted assault did not go quite as planned
now it will once again hurt shale but again it won t beat the resilience of the us shale patch
that much should have become clear in the past three saudi oil output hits record high in novemberon the other hand saudi arabia could start cutting but it will need to convince all other opec members to join the cuts and more importantly russia
reuters earlier today reported quoting unnamed sources that russia had accepted the need to cut production and prices immediately jumped once again highlighting how important the arabia cooperation has become for oil markets if it even needs now it seems like a cut is the more likely outcome
in spite of reservations expressed by nigeria and libya if saudi arabia managed to convince everyone to cut amid the major tensions with iran ahead of the sanctions then it could probably convince them again if only on the grounds that if they don t start cutting all will agrees
saudi arabia can not afford another slump in oil prices he warns
it needs to keep revenues high to help its economy climb out of recession and finance ambitious social and economic transformation yet the kingdom is preparing
kpler reported this week loadings of saudi crude since the start of november had reached new highs of million bpd which was bpd more than the average daily loadings rate for october and much higher than the last high of million bpd booked for june
the bulk of the increase comes from china with shipments in that direction up by more than half a million barrels daily in november from october
production is also at record highs like russia s was ahead of the first cuts in
perhaps we are seeing a lesson learned there or perhaps the kingdom is out of options besides irina slav for top reads from
