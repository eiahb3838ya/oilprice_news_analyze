do trumpâ€™s tweets point to another oil crisis?
president trump spent part of his july holiday shouting at opec on twitter demanding lower gasoline opec monopoly must remember that gas prices are up they are doing little to help
if anything they are driving prices higher as the united states defends many of their members for very little s
this must be a two way street
reduce pricing now the tweets are coming more frequently these days an indication of the political peril that trump feels because of rising gasoline prices
the logic is odd though
trump wants lower oil prices while at the same time his administration is trying to zero out million barrels per day of iranian oil it does not occur to the president that it is trump himself who is driving prices up through his iran policy commerzbank wrote in a note
if the succeeds in blocking iran from exporting its oil opec would struggle to offset the missing barrels
perhaps one of the president s advisors should explain this to him commerzbank s advisers are clearly failing at their task but iranian officials tried to lend a helping hand by explaining the situation
you impose sanctions on major producers founders of opec and yet you are asking them to reduce the prices
since when did you start ordering opec iran s opec governor hossein kazempour ardebili said in a statement
your tweets have driven the prices up by at least
pls stop it otherwise it will go even higher related the new oil cartel threatening opecmeanwhile the congress has revived legislation that would remove the immunity that sovereign nations have from being sued from antitrust violations
the nopec act would make opec subject to antitrust law allowing the to go after opec for manipulating the oil market
the legislation has floated around washington for years typically going nowhere because past presidents have consistently opposed the legislation still probably won t go anywhere but opec could be forgiven for being confused by the mixed signals coming from washington which can essentially be boiled down to stop your behavior but intervene in the markets to manipulate prices to our benefit and nobody is allowed to buy oil from iran and why are oil prices so high
do something about it leaving aside the inherently contradictory objectives from washington it isn t clear that opec could stop the oil price rally even if it wanted to
the group is starting to lose control of the oil market now that the supply outages are piling trump wants saudi arabia to add million barrels per day of fresh supply but the kingdom would struggle to ramp up by that much
saudi arabia s record high output level stands at about
using its entire spare capacity would mean producing at around but most analysts believe that would take more than a year to achieve and some analysts question whether it s even possible at all
related do crude producers really want higher oil prices producing at that level would require more drilling and expanding existing fields it isn t as simple as just opening the in the past few years opec s spare capacity has dwindled both in absolute terms and as a share of the oil market reducing its influence
excluding new members gabon and equatorial guinea opec s effective spare capacity has declined by bpd over the past five years even as global demand has climbed by according to energy leaves very little firepower to call upon
the potential outage in iran alone could swamp the group s spare capacity
the is hoping to take of iranian exports offline which is about as much as the theoretical spare capacity that saudi arabia has left
the spare capacities in opec countries are just sufficient to offset this amount but will not be enough if supply is additionally reduced by outages elsewhere such as in libya and canada at present and by falling oil production in venezuela
prices will rise as a result commerzbank nick cunningham of top reads from
