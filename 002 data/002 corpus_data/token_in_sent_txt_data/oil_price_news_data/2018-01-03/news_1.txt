can norway survive without big oil?
supermajors are shunning arctic oil exploration in norway or at least that s the overwhelming feeling after the last licensing round conducted by the norwegian petroleum directorate in early companies applied for blocks or parts of blocks of which almost all were in the barents sea
the only supermajor in the crowd was shell
what happened more than half of norway s untapped oil and gas reserves are located in the barents sea
that s beyond the arctic area that contains an estimated billion barrels of crude and trillion cu ft of natural gas in total
norway s share is more than billion barrels of undiscovered likely would have sounded irresistible five years ago with big oil always on the hunt for projects armed with the means to afford investing in them
no more
now to and including the likes of exxon total bp chevron and quicker and higher returns on slimmer arctic is a harsh place to drill
the climate may be changing but not enough to make the place
also environmentalists will never get off drillers cases so that s some additional pressure especially now
in november environmental organizations took the norwegian government to court over the awarding of oil drilling licenses in the arctic and argued on the first day of hearings that the licenses should be withdrawn as they violate norway s constitution and the country s pledge to fulfill the terms of the paris climate agreement
the court is expected to rule on the case later this there s more
last year saw a record number of exploration wells drilled in norway s section of the barents sea but only one of them yielded a commercially viable discovery
that s one out of wells drilled
it s also not large enough to deserve its own development statoil will develop the discovery as part of its johan castberg project which is due to start pumping oil in
related higher oil prices slow china s crude stockpilingeven that s not all in the bad news department that would explain why big oil is less than eager to tap norway s arctic oil and gas wealth
the most anticipated well to be drilled in the barents sea was one in an area that norway calls korpfjell
it s believed to hold massive oil and gas reserves but the only thing statoil found there was a amount of natural gas
all this is enough to put off any supermajor looking for fast profits in the norway tough times may be coming if statoil lundin aker bp rosneft wintershall and with the string of private energy independents still interested in the to make a meaningful discovery in the near future
the country s oil production is currently half of what it was in
it will continue to decline although gas production is growing unless more discoveries are will be difficult to make discoveries without big oil s deep pockets but statoil isn t giving up
it s planning another intense drilling campaign for this year because its pipeline is pretty empty johan castberg is the only significant arctic project in this irina slav for top reads from
