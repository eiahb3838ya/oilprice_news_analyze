whatâ€™s behind the canadian rig count crash
the rig count has been on the rise for months despite some recent hiccups but canada s rig count recently plunged amid low oil s rig count fell from to for the week ending on december a massive drop off
that took the rig count to a low
obviously the losses were concentrated in alberta where most of the rigs tend to be
alberta s rig count sank from to in the last week of
but saskatchewan also saw its rig count from in to just three at the close of the year
the losses can likely be chalked up to the meltdown in prices for canadian oil
western canada select wcs a benchmark that tracks heavy oil in canada often trades at a significant discount to oil prices in the united states
but the discount became unusually large in november and december for a variety of reasons
the outage at the keystone pipeline led to a rapid buildup in oil inventories in canada and storage hit a record high in canada s oil industry has been unable to build new pipelines to get the landlocked oil from alberta to market
alberta oil producers are essentially hostage to their buyers in the and with oil production now bumping up against a ceiling in terms of pipeline capacity the glut is starting to weigh on wcs december enbridge announced that it will ration the space on its mainline oil pipeline system for january as canada s pipelines are essentially at full capacity
enbridge said that it will apportion lines and which move heavy crude by percent
the term apportionment is a euphemism for oil producers are unable to get all of their product onto the pipeline and are hit with restrictions
that means the oil has to be diverted into storage

the problem is that there s little prospect of a solution in the
railroads although they are taking incrementally more cargoes can not handle the excess supply all on their own especially with new supply coming online
and there are no serious pipeline capacity additions expected for about two years at the earliest
the three main morgan s trans mountain expansion transcanada s keystone xl and enbridge s line face legal questions and uncertain completion top of that canada s oil sands producers are adding new supply
at today s prices it makes little sense to greenlight new upstream projects particularly in expensive oil sands
but there are still some projects that are finishing up that were given the years ago when oil prices were substantially higher
suncor energy is set to bring its fort hills project online which will add nearly bpd of new supply within all means that the pressure on wcs probably won t go away
the price meltdown from two months ago is probably now showing up in the rig count
the typically sees the rig count fluctuate in response to changes in the oil price by several months and the rig count in canada will only now start to reflect the price plunge from months ago
the rail industry might handle more oil cargoes which could help push up wcs a bit but the discount might persist for some could add new refining capacity to process all of that oil right at home an option that is often raised when wcs prices tank
ihs markit recently studied several scenarios for canada s oil industry including upgrading existing refineries to process heavy oil into a lighter synthetic form of oil as well as building entirely new refineries
ihs markit concluded that there is an opportunity to convert existing refineries but that the abundance of light oil supply in north america could challenge the economics
new refining capacity is a risk
in any event refined products and lighter oil would still need to be exported via pipeline
related shale can t offset oil discoveriesin short canada s oil industry faces more obstacles than say the shale drillers in the united states
the rig count is closely tracked around the world for clues into what happens next in the oil increase is assumed to mean that more shale supply will be forthcoming while a decrease is a sign of market tightness and potentially higher prices
the publication of this weekly data has global s rig count on the other hand could continue to struggle even as shale drillers spring into action in response to higher prices
canadian producers won t benefit as much from the upswing in the global market due to their local and regional problems mostly related to the lack of pipeline nick cunningham of top reads from
