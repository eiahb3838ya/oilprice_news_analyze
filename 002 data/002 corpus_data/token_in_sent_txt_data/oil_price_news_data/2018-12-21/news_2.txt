saudis tread on thin ice as prices slide
energy planners in saudi arabia must be scratching their heads in wonder even possibly despair
the kingdom had picked itself up after threats of near economic collapse in amid a then oversupply scenario in global oil markets with prices that dropped to lows but now things are looking grim once the kingdom decision in late to open the oil production spigots and ramp up production in the midst of an oil supply glut mostly due to increased shale oil production prices tumbled
they had reached over per barrel in but by january had dipped below the psychologically important and economically damaging per barrel price results for the saudis was cataclysmic with problems ranging from historically high budget deficits reaching a high of billion in to being forced to put in place its first ever and politically unpopular austerity measures as well as issuing its first international bond sale to raise october with saudi state coffers low and the government bleeding red ink mohamed al tuwaijri the saudi deputy economic minister said in a rare appearance on national television if we saudi arabia didn t take any reform measures and if the global economy stays the same then we re doomed for bankruptcy in three to four years
the formation of late the saudis had had enough and were forced to turn to producers to stop the pain including oil production heavyweight and longtime adversary russia forming what is now known as
the new group of oil producing partners was able to trim oil production enough to restore oecd oil inventory levels back to five year averages around the third quarter of and not only put a floor under prices in essence restoring a semblance of market equilibrium but their actions drove prices to four year highs this october so high that it created concerns of demand destruction

his softer tone with longtime regional foe israel his close relationship with the trump administration and his plans to revamp the saudi economy including less dependency on oil revenue seemed too good to be true but at the end of the day it fell global oil price plungeglobal oil markets became saturated again oil prices have quickly dropped around percent since reaching october highs along with slowing global economic growth in large part due to ongoing trade tensions between washington and beijing are setting in
on top of this laundry list of oil market worries the world s top three oil producers the russia and saudi arabia have been pumping oil at record saudi prestigehowever the biggest detriment in the saudi plan to revamp both its global image and its economy has been saudi implication in the controversial death of dissident journalist jamal khashoggi in early october in the saudi consulate in turkey
now amid still fresh wounds to saudi prestige as well as doubt over bin salman s ability to rule the kingdom foreign investment in saudi arabia is drying up possibly taking the kingdom precipitously close to the dismal days of and when it looked like saudi arabia could come apart at the seams

global oil benchmark brent crude is now trading in the range while oil benchmark west texas intermediate wti crude is hovering in the range a price point unthinkable just two months remains to be seen if the new oil production deal to trim output by million starting in january and lasting for six months with a review period in april will help oil market jitters and be enough to dry up oversupply
however given that the will continue to ramp up production to an energy information administration estimated million or higher next year and with the likelihood that no trade deal will be reached between washington and beijing by their march deadline oil markets will likely remain nervous with prices through the first quarter remaining in the mid to mid range or possibly lower at which point déjà vu will set in for saudi arabia all too reminiscent of a few years ago when the kingdom barely survived economically
