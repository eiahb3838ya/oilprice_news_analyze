russia continues to be the key partner of opec and its largest producer saudi arabia in managing the oil market
for a second production cut deal in a row moscow joined the cartel s cuts taking the lion s share of the cuts intended for the members of the a second production cut in row russia will be gradually reducing output and could reach its share of cuts by the end of the first quarter its energy minister alexander novak said this s oil production will be cut from the october baseline which was a new record high of million bpd
between may and october this year russia had reversed its entire cut that was pledged as part of the initial deal and added even more on top of that as moscow saudi arabia the uae and kuwait pumped more oil to offset what was expected to be a steep drop in iranian oil supply due to the production cuts may have postponed plans of some russian oil companies to boost output but the reductions and in a few months have shown russia s capability to play the role of a key global swing producer second only to saudi arabia according to analysts at s p global russia s rapid production growth from may through october demonstrated its ability to be a key swing producer at a level below that of saudi arabia but as high as any other country in the world s p global platts analytics paul sheldon several of the nations will largely rely on natural mexico for will be purposefully cutting bpd between january and june more than half of s total reduction the new production cut deal is currently for a period with an option to review in april and it s not certain how long these cuts will actually last russia s production could continue to surprise on the upside after the cuts expire platts analytics says contrary to the gloomy scenarios proposed by the international energy agency iea and russia s own energy s oil production could peak as early as in due to high taxes and costs provided there are no benefits for exploration or tax incentives introduced novak said in september this year

betting on any decline in russian production has been a losing proposition since related major lng shortage increasingly likelyrussia s huge reserves growing technological capabilities of domestic companies and an eventual removal of the western sanctions could also help russian oil production at some point down the road sheldon says
according to platts analytics russia s oil production will be in the million million bpd range between and stimulate production and development of oil fields russia is also overhauling its complex taxation system for the oil some of the most burdensome oil taxes in the world
moscow will test in a new tax for several types of oil fields including such in the key western siberian region which is expected to ease the tax burden and at the same time encourage field tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
