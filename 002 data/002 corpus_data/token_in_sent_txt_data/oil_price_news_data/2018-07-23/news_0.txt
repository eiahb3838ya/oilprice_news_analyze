anti-opec bill could be a game-changer for oil markets
in its effort to wrest more control over global oil markets away from foreign producers congress has been pushing a bill that would let the sue opec for oil price fixing
the bill called no oil producing and exporting cartels act or nopec was first introduced in two republican senators and two democrats introduced legislation last week that s aimed at allowing the government to bring lawsuits against opec members for antitrust violations which would be an amendment to the sherman act of sherman act changed american business culture
it was the first legislation enacted by congress to curb concentrations of power that interfere with trade and reduce economic competition
one of the act s main provisions outlaws all combinations that restrain trade between states or with foreign prohibition applies not only to formal cartels but also to any agreement to fix prices limit industrial output share markets or exclude competition
the second part of the act and key provision that most americans are familiar with makes illegal all attempts to monopolize any part of trade or commerce in the country
some companies to be charged under the act include the breakup of at t in the with the creation of regional phone companies or and microsoft which was found in violation of the act in but successfully appealed a breakup of the company in it s long past time to put an end to illegal price fixing by opec chuck grassley one of the republican senators to push the legislation said in a statement last week
we are committed to reducing our reliance on foreign oil especially when it s artificially and illegally priced
our bill shows the opec members we will not tolerate their flagrant antitrust related is the oil world in panic mode however the nopec idea is nothing new and dates back to at least
both president george bush and president barack obama threatened to use their veto power to halt it from becoming law
in a similar bill passed in the house of representatives in a vote and in the senate by only to fail afterward in the face of white house opposition
this time around however there is a good chance that trump would sign such a bill into rhetorictrump has been critical of opec for years and during the presidential election that war of words escalated to the front pages of international newspapers
trump said at the time that the should block all oil imports from saudi arabia
trump also vowed to secure american energy independence from our foes and the oil cartels while also creating complete american energy response just days after trump was elected saudi arabia oil minister and aramco chairman khalid fired back
he said in a financial times interview that at his heart trump will see the benefits of saudi oil imports and i think the oil industry will also be advising him accordingly that blocking trade in any product is not the is sort of the for capitalism and free markets added
the continues to be a very important part of a global industry that is interconnected that is dealing with a fungible commodity which is crude oil
so having equalization through free trade is very healthy for the saudi oil minister added that the saudis were waiting for trump s presidency as his presidential campaign had amounted to feet announcements that may that time trump and saudi arabia have turned the relations between the two countries back on firming footing
saudi arabia was instrumental in persuading trump to reimpose sanctions against iran while riyadh for its part has seemingly kowtowed to trump s tweets calling for opec and the saudis to commit to higher oil production to offset high oil and gas prices a point of contention for the administration as congressional election in november the opec monopoly must remember that gas prices are up they are doing little to help
if anything they are driving prices higher as the united states defends many of their members for very little s
this must be a street
reduce pricing now trump tweeted in one of several warnings to opec
related iraq orders internet blackout to quell protestshowever despite the current revamping of the playbook on checking iranian geological influence in the middle east and its nuclear development ambitions trump only months in office is increasingly showing an unprecedented ability to offend long standing allies while appeasing long term rivals including russia and north market dynamicsthe danger for relations however if a nopec bill was passed by both houses and signed into law by the president would be cataclysmic
it would indicate more american geopolitical and even economic hegemony and destabilize global oil markets and the structure of middle eastern geopolitics
though many balk as opec and the saudis regain control of global oil markets a forced of that system would be counterproductive and likely see more agreement over oil mark control as well as geopolitical deals being only would the saudis balk at what they deemed as a frontal an attack on the economic lifeblood of the country but of the ruling royal family but they would have a hard time understanding it
it should be remembered that opec and now opec with its partners are masters at colluding and controlling supply and even geopolitics in an effort to control prices something not allowed under the best course for lawmakers and trump would be to let the market determine prices demand and even geopolitical developments and to not unduly interfere in the tim daiss for top reads from
