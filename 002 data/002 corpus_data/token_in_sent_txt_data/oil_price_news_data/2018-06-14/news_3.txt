petrochemicals: the future for big oil
plastics and petrochemicals are the future of big oil there is hardly any question about that if by future we mean the distant future
there is still no consensus and there won t be any time soon about when exactly peak oil demand will descend upon the oil industry but most forecasters seem to give the industry another few decades of drawing the bulk of their income from selling fuels
after that it will be plastics and oil is already preparing and it s not alone
the world s biggest oil company in terms of reserves saudi aramco has been very active in seeking refining and petrochemicals projects to invest in as part of its efforts to secure demand for its crude and maximize its value as latest news is a deal between aramco and a california startup that will allow the saudi company to use the startup s oxidative coupling of methane technology in its petrochemicals operations
this technology may sound impressive but it is in fact an alternative to the traditional way of converting gas into ethylene the main raw material for plastics
this alternative according to the california company siluria can increase the portion of crude oil converted into chemical feedstocks to percent per barrel from the current percent while the rest is made into and siluria announced their deal in a joint statement without going into financial details
however the signal is loud and clear aramco is doubling down on its refining and plastics bet made amid the latest oil price crisis

it s the only way but a threat awaits oil companies who take that path the fight against plastics
