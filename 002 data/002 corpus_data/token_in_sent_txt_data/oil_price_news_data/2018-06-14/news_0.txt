the bullish and bearish case for oil
oil prices are in a holding pattern as we await the outcome of the meeting in a few days and while the result of that meeting will almost completely control the direction of oil prices in the there is a bit of disagreement among analysts over the bigger picture in regards to the trajectory of oil prices going let s take a look at two different outlooks one bearish and the other bearish caseoil prices have fallen back from per barrel the direct result of the market recalibrating to the likelihood of higher production in the second half of the year
indeed the single largest factor that could push prices down going forward would be a sizable increase in opec and russia are not the only factors at play
a few other factors could help keep a lid on oil prices over the next year or first thing that comes to mind is soaring shale supply
the has added somewhere around bpd since the start of the year a staggering sum
infrastructure constraints in the permian are real but so far they have not slowed down output
the eia sees the adding another bpd in june from a month earlier
in the could average but it won t stop there
the eia sees production skyrocketing by to an average of next bottom line is that the international energy agency expects oil demand to grow by this year but supply mostly shale will grow by
next year the story is the same demand grows by another and supply will grow by
these numbers suggest that the and a handful of other countries will more than meet global numbers by themselves are sobering
once you add in another of potential production the market starts to look through next year
while geopolitical tensions and lingering risks of large supply disruptions remain an upside risk through we think that prices will be corrected downwards towards end of the year and remain capped in jp morgan wrote in a note
related saudi arabia deal to gradually ease cuts is inevitable there are also some risks to demand not least of which is the recent run up in prices the iea revised down its demand figure in may by bpd because of higher prices
the possibility of an economic slowdown possibly from emerging markets could weigh on demand growth
the past few months has seen currency upheaval in argentina turkey and brazil among other places
argentina just sought an imf bailout and brazil was temporarily crippled by nationwide strikes spurred on by high fuel federal reserve is hiking interest rates which is putting pressure on indebted countries making debt harder to pay off particularly as their currencies weaken relative to the dollar
this is by no means a foregone conclusion but an economic downturn could cut into demand
bank of america merrill lynch said that it is conceivable that oil drops to per barrel in because of emerging market bullish casethe case for higher oil prices is a bit more obvious
global inventories are already back to their average
has kept more than of supply off of the market for the better part of the outlook for higher oil prices comes down to the severe production outages in several places with venezuela front and center
the south american nation has already lost bpd this year and the declines are accelerating
operations at pdvsa s refineries and storage facilities in the caribbean have been disrupted by conocophillips and the facilities in venezuela are buckling under decrepit are being shut down and production already in decline will have to be curtailed because there isn t enough storage and in any event the ports can t handle the export volumes that pdvsa has promised its customers
that could lead to a declaration of force majeure
ultimately venezuela s production which averaged in may is rapidly heading down to the psychologically important threshold of
who knows if it will stop supply disruptions loom elsewhere
iran could lose to because of sanctions although that scenario is subject to a great deal of bloomberg reports that two of libya s largest oil ports stopped loading oil this week because of clashes between rival groups
years ago instability and civil war knocked off much of libya s output
that has since been restored to around essentially double the levels from a year ago
but the latest clashes are a reminder that libya s output can not be is also seeing lower exports because a key pipeline has been shuttered
reuters estimates that nigeria s oil exports could plunge from just under in june to just in july
force majeure on bonny light remains in place
related iran warns north korea about the united will likely increase output but higher production might not even offset these outages
a modest increase from saudi arabia and russia might be swamped by major disruptions especially if they occur all at only thing preventing oil from going to per barrel or higher is the prospect of a wave of shale
indeed the forecasts are impressive but what if shale can t live up to the hype
for at least the next year or so pipeline bottlenecks in the permian could restrain production growth
the permian pipelines are essentially filled to the brim and discounts for midland crude are painfully large
it is unclear how this will play out but if shale undershoots the oil market could find itself short on becomes a serious problem when opec uses up a lot of its spare capacity
raising output now could keep the market but it comes at the expense of spare capacity which could drop to dangerously low levels over the next now it s getting interesting hedge fund manager pierre andurand told the wall street journal earlier this month
we are in the middle of a multiyear bull run he said
we could see oil this in by nick cunningham of top reads from
