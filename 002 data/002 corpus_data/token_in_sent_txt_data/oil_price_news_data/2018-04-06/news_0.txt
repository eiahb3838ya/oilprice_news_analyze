permian bottleneck could impact global oil markets
the permian basin is driving shale growth with expectations that the basin will add enormous volumes this year keeping the oil market
but the permian s pipeline network is already filling up forcing steep discounts for oil and threatening to derail the aggressive growth projections for the eia predicts the permian will hit million barrels per day of output in april an increase of bpd from march and up a shocking bpd from a year ago
shale e ps and the oil majors are pouring in billions of dollars into the region and two out of every three rigs the industry is adding is going into the the shale basin is getting crowded which not only means skyrocketing prices for land and a search for opportunities along the periphery but also rapidly shrinking availability on the permian s pipeline network
as these fringe areas begin to get exploited we are seeing more and more crude that needs to find a pipeline to cushing or the gulf coast john zanner energy analyst for rbn energy told market analysts knew that new pipeline capacity would be necessary in order to move all of the oil out of the permian
but few expected the region to run out of pipeline space so at the end of there was just of line space available out of western texas
this small surplus is likely to turn into a deficit in the second half of the iea wrote in its march oil market report
the pipeline gap could widen further until in turn reducing the price of wti midland relative to related oil prices poised to rise as cycle comes to an end other bottlenecks such as shortages of sand and labour as well as mounting demands for investor returns could also slow growth but most likely beyond
for now us producers continue to ramp up activity the iea wrote in its march oil market iea was spot on except that the bottleneck the agency predicted is already starting to materialize
even late last month when the iea warned about pipeline issues the thinking was that bottlenecks would start to form in according to genscape and reported on by reuters pipeline utilization in the permian has jumped to percent over the past month
genscape says the permian has of pipeline rail and local refining capacity combined
that s a problem given that the eia sees production jumping to in essentially means the pipelines are already close to being completely full and the prices for oil from the permian are starting to reflect that problem
canadian oil producers have been suffering from painful discounts for their oil because of a lack of pipeline capacity but now the permian is running into a similar problem
on wednesday midland light sweet crude traded at a discount relative to what the spreads are telling you is that these pipelines are full going to the gulf coast kendrick rhea at energy consultancy east daley capital told reuters
the earliest possible relief will come from the permian express pipeline which could add bpd of capacity by the end of this is a serious problem for permian drillers who could be forced to slow growth or even shut down some operations if things get worse
that could have a significant impact on are we sleepwalking into the next oil crisis but there are broader ramifications for the global oil market
the assumption that the oil market would be not only this year but for years to come is largely predicated on aggressive growth from shale generally but also the permian in particular
if permian growth comes to a standstill this year that will completely upend conventional wisdom about adequate two opposing forces in the americas dominate our medium term forecast
in the early years us supply far outweighs collapsing venezuelan capacity keeping the world adequately supplied the iea wrote in its oil report
the agency expects the to add over the next five iea warned about a supply problem in the
but if the permian does not add the enormous volumes that everybody thinks it will the supply problems could arrive sooner than expected
to be sure a series of pipeline projects could resolve the bottleneck but several of them are not expected to come online until nick cunningham of top reads from
