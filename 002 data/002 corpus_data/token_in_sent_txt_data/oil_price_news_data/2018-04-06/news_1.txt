has the world started to kick its oil addiction?
until a decade ago most of the world was a captive customer of would pay any price for gasoline and oil demand was soaring regardless of the surging oil recently many countries around the world have started to show more sensitivity to oil demand grows as their economies grow but oil demand is also more susceptible to oil price swings with the oil correlation behaving more like an everyday product according to data by clearview energy partners and research by bloomberg gadfly columnist liam it s at least a decade or more too early to call the end of the world s oil addiction the research and data suggest that in a growing number of large economies oil demand now correlates negatively with oil prices
in other words consumption drops when prices rise and vice common economic concept applicable to almost every other product on the oil this has not always been the energy and denning analyzed data for three periods ending in and the first period until countries comprising of oil demand including the united states india china and russia showed a positive correlation between oil demand and their gross domestic product gdp and between demand and oil prices
in the decade before the financial crisis in oil demand soared almost everywhere in the world despite the fact that oil prices were also rallying
this was the period of chinese industrialization and construction boom which gobbled up oil at any price
in most of the world the picture was the demand rose together with rising economies and with rising oil prices suggesting that those countries were captive customers of oil
related oil prices bristle as rig count climbsthe second period in the research coincides with the financial crisis and the recession that followed
during the years through oil demand decoupled from american economic growth and started to react to the resurgence of oil prices that began in
in that period the shifted away from being a captive customer of oil to look more like germany or japan where the link between gdp and oil consumption has weakened
while this was a profound shift in how oil demand correlated with gdp and oil prices many of the emerging the biggest oil demand drivers india and still looked like captive customers of oil
their oil demand was soaring even in periods of oil price spikes the research and data in the third ten years through oil demand in china and india looked like more responsive to the prevailing oil prices
in those countries and other developing economies oil demand growth is still closely connected with the gdp growth
but oil demand has started to show some negative correlation with oil prices suggesting that consumption is more susceptible to the price of oil than it was in the previous decades
true the period until includes the oil price crash during which the negative correlation was heightened by the fact that demand grew faster because of the low oil prices
related bahrain says giant discovery holds billion barrels of oilnevertheless india and china have now moved into the group of economies that show positive correlation between oil demand and economic growth and a negative correlation between demand and oil prices
the united states is also in this group with a weak positive correlation between demand and gdp and with a negative price correlation the research s not clear whether the global economies will continue to show a negative correlation between oil demand and oil prices from this point onwards but the research suggests that in the united states and even in china and india oil demand is now more sensitive to oil prices than it was a decade or two ago and that oil producers may be wrong to think that they still hold captive customers who would buy their product at any tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
