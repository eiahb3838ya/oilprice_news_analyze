trump takes aim at maduro, threatens oil embargo
a week after venezuelan president nicolas maduro was sworn in for a second term in office the option of a complete oil embargo against venezuela has been put back on the table according to two unnamed sources who spoke to sources also said president trump was mulling over a declaration that recognizes the president of the venezuelan national assembly opposition politician juan guaido as the legitimate president of the officials from the administration did not directly confirm the information cnn quoted the spokesman of the national security council garrett marquis as saying the united states is currently considering all diplomatic political and economic tools in its arsenal in response to the usurpation of power by the illegitimate maduro the last time more sanctions against venezuela s government were discussed actively in washington a source from the administration said a full oil embargo was not among the options the fact is that the greatest sanction on venezuelan oil and oil production is called nicolas maduro and pdvsa s inefficiencies the official said speaking to reuters
at the end of the day nicolas maduro has taken care of really running pdvsa to the ground and essentially more and more making it a interestingly enough however despite the steady decline in venezuela s oil production daily exports of crude to united states refineries have remained relatively stable
according to the latest data from the energy information administration between may and october venezuelan crude exports to the hovered around half a million barrels daily
while this is substantially lower than the export rate from the late it s not as low as it was a decade earlier between and
and refiners might need more

it worked so well now some analysts are worrying there may be a shortage of heavy crude on the way as saudi arabia is also cutting production and when it cuts these analysts said it cuts mostly its heavy crude most refineries on the gulf coast where more than half of the world s crude is processed need heavy crude and there are but a few competitive sources they can tap if the supply of heavy crude becomes too tight for comfort which may well happen if trump goes ahead with an export idea of an oil embargo cnn notes has been previously rejected by the president because it would lead to a jump in prices at the pump of as much as percent
this is not something trump seems to be fine with as evidenced by his reactions to rising prices in the spring and early summer of last year and his urging opec to stop cutting production and let prices go lower
based on this chances are the president will stop short of imposing a full oil embargo on venezuela especially amid a tightening heavy crude irina slav for top reads from
