eia: opec production to fall by 1 million bpd this year
the energy information administration expects opec s combined crude oil production this year to be million barrels per day lower than in when the cartel produced an average million bpd the authority said in its latest energy however won t be enough to push prices higher if the eia turns out correct about the trend in production led by the united states which the eia sees rising by million bpd this year from last
in opec s production is likely to remain flat on with all the growth in global supply coming from the united states brazil canada and russia the eia also said
this is the authority s first steo that covers opec members the eia sees iraq as one major driver of production growth but it also assumes sanctions against iran will remain in place until the end of which coupled with expectations that venezuela s oil production will continue to fall means production growth in iraq will not be enough to offset the negative supply effect of developments in iran and arabia opec s de facto leader and also biggest producer interestingly would not be contribute to growth in production according to the eia
the agency said this year saudi arabia will produce an average of less than the million bpd average rate of production it booked for and nigeria on the other hand will pump more oil this year the eia also said in its projections for opec
angola started up production at two new fields last year kaombo which it will this year expand it with a second phase of development and vandumbu which began production ahead of schedule in late nigeria the offshore egina field operated by total began production at the start of this year
at peak production egina will have the capacity to pump bpd which is equal to about percent of nigeria s current rate of production
