how much further can venezuela’s oil production fall?
ambivalent is the word that best describes the condition venezuelan president nicolás maduro has found himself in
from a formal point of view his january reinauguration went along smoothly and oil production the backbone of venezuelan economy has managed to bounce back somewhat from the trough it has found itself this autumn
yet if you look closely navigating through might turn out to be even more difficult for the bolivarian leader than surviving the arduous year of international pressure is mounting including caribbean countries that thusfar have been either supportive or neutral towards the venezuelan political leadership all the while pdvsa still struggles to become a normal national oil first let s talk a bit about venezuela s success stories
after the steady declines in oil output witnessed in the first half of plummeting from mbpd in january to mbpd production has stabilized somewhat around mark
pdvsa attributes this to the improved functioning of the three upgraders operating in the country used for creating synthetic export grades out of the bitumenous api crudes that the orinoco belt yields
the crude upgraders are inevitably linked to foreign oil majors petromonagas is developed with rosneft petropiar with chevron petrocedeno with total and equinor as the fourth upgrader fully owned by pdvsa has been out of operation
