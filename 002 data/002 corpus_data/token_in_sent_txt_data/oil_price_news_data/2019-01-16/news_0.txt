u.s. oil outlook slammed by lower prices
the recent slide in oil prices may finally start impacting oil production plunge in oil prices in november and december spread gloom around the industry
comments from anonymous oil executives in a survey from the federal reserve bank of dallas from earlier this month clearly depicted the creeping pessimism from oil country
i expect the dramatic unexpected and significant drop in oil prices will significantly decrease revenue for the first half of
i intend to mitigate this by stopping all drilling and deferring any new projects one oil executive told the dallas worried about lack of financing for drilling
it feels like the capital markets equity and debt are backing up fairly hard which will have a noted impact on capital spending if sustained
coupled with the fall in oil prices in the past six weeks this could cause plans to get pared back the executive the downturn in oil prices and even the gloomier outlook from oil executives themselves hadn t really fed through to oil production forecasts
the projections for shale still included heady growth figures despite the plunge in is until as a result of the slide in oil prices over the past three months operators have already started to guide down activity for compared to their initial plans to ramp up activity rystad energy wrote in a new commentary
consequentially we have lowered our expectations for oil production growth by about bpd for and implying less need for takeaway rystad says slower production growth might put a lot less urgency on the closely watched midstream bottlenecks
this raises the question as to which if any of the pipelines projects in the permian slated for development will move forward if there is less oil to fill them rystad stated

at times in midland wti traded at a discount approaching per barrel relative to wti in houston
but midland prices have converged towards wti with a discount of only around per barrel more recently
much of that has to do with some of the pipeline capacity additions in recent production growth going forward could scramble the case for new pipelines
given our current production outlook we see marginal need for the pipelines that have not been approved yet before rystad concluded
this equates to about million bpd capacity over six the oil consultancy singled out phillips s proposed gray oak pipeline expansion as one example
rystad said that there s a likelihood that sufficient commitments won t be reached meaning there won t be demand for the proposed expansion because upstream production will added million barrels per day of new supply in the largest annual increase in history
but growth will slow to a this year and in according to the eia s latest energy outlook
curiously however the eia s estimate that output will average in is unchanged since its november estimate even though it has revised down its price forecast significantly
forthcoming revisions in the months ahead wouldn t be eia did suggest however that oil production won t return to the explosive growth rates of
the agency attributes a more modest growth rate this year and next to pipeline constraints
the agency notes that lower oil prices could curtail drilling but it says that once new pipelines come online later this year production growth will rebound into
it s not clear what to make of this in light of the recent price meltdown

the oil rig count fell by last week according to baker hughes and is at a roughly low at the eia weekly production data which offers a preliminary look into oil output has been roughly unchanged at since november
these numbers are a little rough and are at times out of synch with the more accurate monthly surveys that come out on a lag but they offer a near glimpse into production
