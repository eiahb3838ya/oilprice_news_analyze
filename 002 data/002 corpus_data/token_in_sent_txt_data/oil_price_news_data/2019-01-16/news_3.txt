offshore spending to overtake shale in 2019
rystad energy forecasts offshore spending will outgrow spending on onshore shale activities this year
service companies exposed to the offshore subsea market and the maintenance modifications and operations mmo sector are set to benefit from this trend current oil price levels spending on land rigs fracking and other services for the shale industry is likely to stay essentially flat in
the offshore service market too will feel the effects of the recent oil price slide but this sector is nevertheless projected to grow by a robust this year according to rystad energy many would expect offshore spending to be cut as drastically as shale but offshore budgets were at a low last year after four years of intense cost focus and from that level you don t need much additional activity or inflation to drive up the market rystad energy head of oilfield services research audun martinsen said

the number of fracked wells per day dropped from an average of around wells per day to wells per day and frack service pricing continued to fall in the fourth quarter of
for the full year of we expect more or less the same number of wells completed at around wells and we do not anticipate seeing utilization returning to the levels as seen in early martinsen energy expects the uptick in offshore spending to be driven by exploration and greenfield projects
in addition operational expenditure opex budgets will likely swell thanks to cost inflation more fields coming on stream and a buildup of work that needs to be completed

as long as oil prices are below a barrel for brent it could be interesting to take a second look at service contractors exposed to the offshore sector to see what they have to offer as compared to service companies exposed to shale martinsen breaking down capex and opex budgets across resource types and allocating the spending to the associated service segments rystad energy estimates revenue growth based on known backlog latest contract awards and regional it seems that the names that will be able to deliver the best revenue growth are the service companies exposed to the offshore subsea market and mmo
