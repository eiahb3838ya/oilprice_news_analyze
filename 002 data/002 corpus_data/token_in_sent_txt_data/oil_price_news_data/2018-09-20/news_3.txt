strong rise in spending keeps offshore ahead of shale
a recent surge in final investment decisions fids on offshore oil and gas projects has set the scene for a healthy increase in offshore investments next year thus preventing the shale industry from overtaking offshore for the first time according to rystad energy s latest analysis
this is due to a percent rise in the number of offshore projects that were sanctioned in with fids followed by similar growth this year with close to offshore projects to be sanctioned
with that we will finally see offshore investment levels rise again in after four straight years of our offshore activity index is pointing to annual growth rates of about percent towards thereby returning to the high activity levels seen in
coupled with annual service price inflation of percent offshore oilfield service purchases are projected to grow by percent per year towards says audun martinsen head of oilfield research at rystad the same time the rise in offshore spending will coincide with a sequence of factors that will slow growth levels in the shale sector
logistical challenges takeaway capacity bottlenecks and growing oversupply in the proppant and fracking market are all contributing to pull shale s growth trajectory downward says well fracturing activity surpassed wells per day in april but since then it has flattened out at just north of wells per day
although demand for frack sand in the us is expected to grow at percent cagr from to this is expected to be eclipsed by an even greater jump in supply which is forecast to increase by percent in and percent in
this oversupply will have a negative impact on sand mines are being built out in the permian eagle ford haynesville and dj basins
northern white sand prices have been declining rapidly and we have observed permian sand minegate prices falling below ton martinsen energy sees the net effect of these factors being that investment levels in shale will grow at a slower pace than previously expected and end up at about billion in
for about shale wells are forecast to be drilled and completed in north america which will likely translate to about percent growth in investments in the sector
related nuclear power could be key in reaching climate goals shale has thus lost some momentum at a time when investors have again found an appetite for the offshore domain stimulated by a steep reduction in offshore costs and breakeven levels which in turn have been driven by favorable unit prices martinsen energy data shows that global offshore capital investment fell by percent in and is projected to fall by another percent this year reaching only about billion less than half the billion invested at the peak in
offshore purchases are however projected to rise at an accelerating rate over the next three years
