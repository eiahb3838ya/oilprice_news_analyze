iran: we won’t let opec boost production
it s about that time again
wti hits per barrel and the is protect the countries of the middle east they would not be safe for very long without us and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices
we will remember
the opec monopoly must get prices down now opec does have a meeting in the coming days in algiers to assess the state of the oil market and decide on next steps
but one of the largest challenges for opec is balancing the oil market in the wake of lost barrels from iran a key factor driving up prices and also a fact that seems to be lost on the american are no clear solutions for that leave the oil market satisfied while also maintaining group obvious course of action is to allow for higher production levels
but there is no way to do this while also getting all parties on board
iran s oil minister said that any change to tehran s allotment would be blocked
i will definitely veto any decision that threatens our national interest bijan zanganeh said in an interview with reporters from s p global platts and bloomberg news
anyone who says they will compensate for the shortfall in the market is speaking against iran
this is a political statement not because any opec agreement requires unanimous consent iran could block any changes to the formal oil production cut still holds a little bit of leverage because the specifics of the june agreement which called for increased production on the order of million barrels per day were not hammered out
in all likelihood saudi arabia and russia would realistically take on a greater share of output mostly because they are the only ones that have the ability to choose to produce substantially formalizing those increases is politically tricky
after all iran is taking tangible losses because of sanctions
those missing barrels have to be made up elsewhere
saudi arabia russia and a few gulf states are the only countries that can increase output on a large scale
but even if riyadh can physically replace the gap left over by iran iran would never vote in favor of such a scenario
no consensus on this issue is likely commerzbank wrote in a a de facto increase in saudi production in lieu of supply losses from iran is the only realistic outcome
the end result could be no formal agreement on specific allotments that take into account falling production from iran and venezuela
but the shift in market share may happen anyway whether or not approves it

they are sacrificing opec they are destroying opec and slowly slowly without directly saying so they want to gather some names together to create a forum to replace opec and manage the market zanganeh also said that saudi officials should fess up to their real motivations
if they want to produce excessively we can not stop them zanganeh said
there is no forcible instrument in opec
but they should do it in the name of opec
they should come out and say has phoned and told me to increase output
and i have no other way but to do so
not only are saudi arabia and russia taking on a greater role in the current moment to ensure market stability but they are also looking to institutionalize the arrangement for the

saudi arabia has added about bpd since may while russia has added about bpd
but covering the accelerating losses from iran won t be an easy task
iran could lose as much as by the end of the year according to s p global platts analytics
venezuela could lose another arabia is the only country with the ability to increase production on the scale of what we are talking about here but any ramp up in production necessarily cuts into spare capacity which is already at relatively low levels
the oil market will welcome more barrels from saudi arabia but oil traders will nonetheless grow jittery as spare capacity from earlier this week that riyadh was content letting oil prices rise above per barrel are perhaps a sign that saudi officials are acknowledging the challenge of keeping a lid on prices at a time when iran is seeing significant disruptions
as a result it won t be surprising if saudi arabia increases output in the months ahead but that the effort fails to prevent oil from moving higher
