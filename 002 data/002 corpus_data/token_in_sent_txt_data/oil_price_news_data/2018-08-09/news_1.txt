a major setback looms for colorado shale
an initiative to expand the setback distance required for oil and gas drilling in colorado just received a boost potentially making the november ballot
the stricter drilling requirements could have significant implications for colorado shale drilling and the industry is decrying the measure as a ban on new would require oil and gas wells to be a minimum of feet away from occupied structures which means houses and vulnerable areas which includes parks public spaces and fresh water among other areas
that distance is much greater than the current distance of just feet for occupied structures and feet for high occupancy buildings such as hospitals and other words shale drillers would have to place their wells at a much greater distance from local campaign to impose stricter drilling requirements on the oil and gas industry gained urgency last year after an explosion from a flow line attached to a vertical well run by anadarko petroleum and drilled by a previous owner killed two people and injured two others
earlier this year anadarko settled with the victims and survivors on undisclosed flow line was thought to be abandoned but it was uncapped and the well was only feet from the victims house
following the disaster anadarko temporarily suspended operations at vertical wells across northern colorado out of an abundance of caution some of which were subsequently brought back online after inspections
related oil is a very real possibilitythe incident is not directly related to the drilling of new wells within close proximity to houses and buildings but it sparked ire against the oil and gas industry
an explosion in a residential area stemming from a gas line has led to growing opposition to a drilling presence right up against homes and businesses
and because drilling activity has increased so dramatically in recent years public resistance has also increased in corresponding industry is obviously opposed to the setback measure but organizers in favor of greater setback requirements apparently secured enough signatures to put the measure up for a statewide referendum in november
the november election in colorado is likely an inflection point for the state s oil and gas industry according to a july research note from height securities llc
in addition to the ballot measure control of the state legislature and the governor s mansion could potentially be in the hands of the democrats although what that means for the industry is still unclear
the leading candidate for governor congressman jared polis has softened his opposition to oil and gas after previously supporting bans on the ballot measure requiring greater setbacks could have a dramatic effect
in weld county colorado where much of the drilling in colorado s dj basin takes place the greater setback distances would put roughly percent of the surface land off limits to drilling according to the colorado oil gas conservation commission a state regulator
overall roughly percent of the state s total land mass would be off limits
by forcing drillers to move away from buildings and neighborhoods many fewer locations would be available to industry paints the setback requirements in apocalyptic terms
that is effectively a ban on the industry dan haley president of the colorado oil gas association told bloomberg in a july interview
you d basically have no new wells drilled in colorado
related the shale boom that will never happenthe share prices of companies that are active in colorado s dj basin are lagging behind some of their industry peers
goldman sachs notes that the stocks of companies like extraction oil gas src energy pdc energy noble energy and anadarko petroleum all with a sizable drilling presence in the dj basin are underperforming a broader etf of shale companies by to percent
in fact extraction oil gas and pdc energy appear to be the most exposed to this referendum based on our assumed value for their undrilled dj basin resources as a percent of total company value goldman sachs wrote in a is not a certainty that the measure will qualify for the november ballot
previous initiatives aimed at increasing setback provisions came up short
in several proposed initiatives were withdrawn after the industry and local and state governments reached a compromise to setup the oil gas task force
in an initiative to grant local communities authorities to institute greater setback distances did not qualify for the ballot after not receiving enough signatures ahead of the after last year s explosion the issue is resonating a lot more with state residents
moreover the setback provisions will not be the only thing on the ballot
the midterm elections promise to turn out a lot of voters with the enthusiasm more clearly evident on the left of the political nick cunningham of top reads from
