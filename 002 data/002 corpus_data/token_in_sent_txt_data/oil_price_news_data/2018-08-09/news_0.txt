canadian oil crisis continues as prices plunge
canadian oil producers are once again suffering from a steep discount for their oil causing the largest spread between canadian oil and wti in canada select wcs recently fell below per barrel dropping to as low as per barrel on tuesday
that put it roughly per barrel below wti the largest discount since sharp decline in wcs prices is a reflection of a shortage of pipeline capacity
much of the talk about pipeline bottlenecks these days focuses on the permian basin and the unfolding slowdown in shale drilling which could curtail oil production growth
but canada s oil industry was contending with an inability to build new pipeline infrastructure long before texas shale the problem has grown more acute over the last months
even as pipeline takeaway capacity hasn t budged canadian oil production continues to rise
output could jump by around barrels per day bpd in followed by another increase in according to the international energy agency

until enbridge s line replacement is completed targeted for late midstream capacity won t expand
enbridge recently received a crucial permit from the state of minnesota through which the pipeline will traverse even though state regulators questioned the need for the pipeline
environmental groups and native american tribes affected by the pipeline have vowed to mount a resistance to the replacement and construction of the line echoing the protests of the dakota access pipeline from two years ago
related shockwave in shipping could send brent soaring they bringing highly toxic highly poisonous tar sands oil directly through major watersheds and the last standing reserve of wild rice that the ojibwe have to harvest bill paulson a member of the ojibwe tribe told cnn last month
our culture is the wild rice and gathering and being out in the woods
if there a threat to that then there a direct threat to the it is unclear how this will play out but the opposition could delay the project beyond the expected start date
that means that the discount for wcs will stick because there is little if any empty space on alberta s pipelines not only will the wcs discount linger but the benchmark could suffer from higher volatility
the western canadian oil patch is operating on the edge of available takeaway capacity which makes discounts especially sensitive to shifts in supply
syncrude ramping up from its outage demand
midwest refinery maintenance or marginal transport capacity
rail capacity spread too thin rory johnston a commodity economist at scotiabank told theory alberta could build more refining capacity to process canadian oil rather than scrambling to find pipeline space or selling at a steep discount but refineries are expensive and they would not resolve the problem of takeaway capacity
the majority of hydrocarbons produced in western canada need to be exported building additional refineries domestically to get around crude oil pipeline bottlenecks would simply shift it to a product pipeline capacity challenge johnston said
one way or another those barrels still need to get to end consumers either by pipeline rail barge or related oil prices hit low as trade war heats upshipping oil by rail to the gulf coast can cost as much as per barrel or more according to scotiabank double the rate for shipping by pipeline
but with the wcs discount as large as it is the economics could still work out
however rail companies have been hesitant to invest in new rail capacity for shipping oil especially if the business opportunity of doing so only lasts for another two or three years
still shipments have climbed significantly this year hitting a record high barrels per day in may the latest month for which data is available
however even if rail economics look attractive the lack of sufficient capacity means that rail won t be able to entirely bridge the midstream capacity stubbornly stuck without a solution the canadian government has moved to essentially nationalize the trans mountain expansion project buying it from kinder morgan after the company moved to scrap the expansion on that front as well ottawa continues to receive bad news following its desperate bid to take over the project
the canadian press reported on august that expanding the project will cost billion more than previously thought and will take a year longer than expected putting the start date off until late nick cunningham of top reads from
