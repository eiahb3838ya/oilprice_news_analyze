the revival of mexico’s oil industry
over the past decade mexico s crude oil production has been falling due to a natural decline at mature fields and a lack of significant to compensate
over the past years mexico has opened its energy sector to private investment ending a monopoly of its state oil firm year pemex s crude oil production dropped again
opec and the international energy agency iea expect mexico s production to continue to fall this last year was also a year of two very significant oil discoveries in mexico a huge offshore discovery by private companies a first in years and a large onshore discovery by its landmark energy reform from mexico now hopes to attract a growing number of international companies to explore its offshore waters in a bid to offset declining production and fill state coffers with potential january mexico will hold an auction for deepwater oil blocks for which major international companies have been to participate including chevron exxonmobil bp shell statoil total eni hess inpex pemex repsol and china offshore oil these deepwater blocks will have to compete for the oil majors attention with other promising offshore areas in the americas such as brazil and guyana
related is this the world s most critical pipeline in addition there is some uneasiness about a political risk in mexico as incumbent president enrique pena nieto the architect of the energy reform is completing his last term in office this year
the for the july presidential election is a leftist populist candidate andres manuel lopez obrador who has pledged to hold a referendum on the energy reform and review the oil contracts with international firms
although it s far from certain that obrador would entirely undo his predecessor s reforms there s industry concern that the mexican market could present some difficulties for foreign investors or that an obrador presidency could create uncertainties in the regulatory investment opportunities are crucial for mexico to lift its crude oil production
pemex exploración y producción the upstream unit of pemex has seen its crude oil production drop each year since with the average production down from million bpd in to million bpd in
in production was less than million bpd in each month with the last above production figure in june
production in november and december was even less than million to opec s latest monthly oil market report oil supply from mexico is expected to have dropped by bpd annually in the largest supply decline last year followed by china
mexico s production decline will not be so steep this year according to opec with the country forecast to lose just bpd of oil production in iea also expects mexico alongside china to see its production drop this year but strong growth from the and increases in brazil and canada are expected to lead to a total production increase of million bpd in it s not all doom and gloom in mexico s oil sector
last summer the energy reform started to pay off when a consortium including foreign companies struck oil in a discovery off the mexican coast with initial estimates suggesting that holds in excess of billion barrels of in november pemex announced the largest onshore discovery in the last quality light crude oil and estimated volumes similar to the discovery
related what could push oil to globally the volume of oil discoveries hit an low last year but mexico made the top three countries in terms of largest volumes discovered in together with senegal and guyana rystad energy has estimated
since an average of million barrels of oil equivalent boe resources have been discovered yearly in mexico aatisha mahajan exploration analyst at rystad energy wrote in an october article
however discoveries in mature areas have taken an average of six to nine years to start up while recent discoveries are not substantial enough to reverse the declining trend in mexico s production that has been down since with annual declines of nearly percent between and energy has estimated that mexico s offshore still has around billion boe of undiscovered resources and further successful exploration has the potential to upturn the production trend by according to do this mexico needs policies and contract terms attractive enough to compete for big oil s tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
