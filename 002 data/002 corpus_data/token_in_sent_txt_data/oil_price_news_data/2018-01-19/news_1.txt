oil traders have never been this bullish
net long bets on wti and brent hit over billion barrels last week
speculators are apparently falling over themselves to pour money into these two futures
and prices are reacting as they usually do when large amounts of money are betting on these two contracts or pulling out of them
is this good news for producers though according to some authors such as bloomberg gadfly s liam denning it s pretty good news for shale drillers who are hedging their production at higher prices and it should be good news for opec and russia as well
opec has a habit of complaining about speculators clout on the oil market but now denning argues the cartel should be grateful to the money managers for supporting should be grateful not just because brent is now hovering around us a barrel but also because contracts are now more expensive than ones and opec sells most of its crude on the spot as oilprice wrote earlier this week there are those who don t believe the current level of oil prices is something that opec is happy about
prices analysts argue have soared too high for opec s comfort and now the cartel may be looking for ways to talk the price down as citi s ed morse told bloomberg
in other words opec has no reason to be grateful to speculators about their number of long positions
on the contrary it has a reason to be angry at them
related the least compliant country in the opec dealbut some observers of events on the oil market note why would opec or rather saudi arabia want to talk prices down ahead of aramco s ipo
it doesn t make sense to actively try and push prices down when riyadh is going all in on a massive economic reform program that will be funded with the proceeds from the will doubtless continue to fly back and forth until at least june when opec and russia will meet to discuss the progress of the cut deal and the next steps
it s unlikely we ll see either of the above views prevail over the other before then but there is something else that could happen sooner rather than later that would affect prices and either help opec in its perceived attempts to rein in the rally or disappoint it in its quest for prices depending on the something is a selloff
reuters john kemp earlier this week warned that bullish bets on the six leading oil and oil product futures and options had hit billion barrels in the week to january
kemp noted that this is higher than any other on record exceeding by a wide margin anything seen even during the spike in oil prices during late and the first half of this level of bullish bets is unsustainable over any longer stretch of time that much is clear
either or a scare that prices are about to start falling soon for whatever reason will trigger a selloff
the most likely reason for the scare would be rising production
prices already reacted negatively to eia s latest weekly report that revealed oil production had grown to million barrels
a selloff could be around the irina slav for top reads from
