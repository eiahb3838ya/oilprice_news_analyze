the no.1 challenge to the oil rally
the oil price rally could get derailed by explosive growth from shale in and substantial gains in canada and brazil will also add to the supply international energy agency iea acknowledged in its latest oil market report that the recent rally in oil prices came on the heels of significant tightening but that the supply picture still looks rally in brent prices to was driven in part by some unexpected interruption and geopolitical tension including the possible unraveling of the iran nuclear deal the closure of the forties pipeline a few weeks back disruption in libya and the steep decline in venezuela s oil also continue to decline for the time being and even picked up pace at the end of last year
the iea said that oecd commercial stocks declined by million barrels in november a pace that was twice as fast as the average
and in december preliminary data suggests the declines were even fact inventories declined in three consecutive quarters in
on average inventories fell at a rate of bpd which the iea said was exceptional
s uch a threesome has happened rarely in modern history examples include prices doubled prices increased by nearly and prices increased by this time around the stock draw pushed up brent prices by almost per barrel
the oil market is clearly tightening the iea the biggest oil collapse in historyin this sense it is not as if the surge in positioning from hedge funds and other money managers is unjustified the underlying fundamentals point to a real tightening underway in the physical market for crude soaring supplies from the and other countries threaten to stall the rally
the iea raised its forecast for oil production growth this year from bpd to million barrels per day
that comes on the heels of sharp upward revisions from the eia and opec not to mention a slew of investment banks
everyone is in agreement on one thing shale is set for serious growth much more than analysts predicted just one month the big supply story is unfolding fast in the americas
explosive growth in the us and substantial gains in canada and brazil will far outweigh potentially steep declines in venezuela and mexico the iea it is possible that very soon us crude production could overtake that of saudi arabia and also rival russia russia produces more than
the eia predicted earlier this month that the would top by the end of it isn t just the adding new barrels to the market
brazil and canada are two other countries expected to post strong gains although unlike shale both countries have projects set to come online that were planned years after factoring in some declines in output from mexico and china the iea sees production rising by in a figure that represents a return to the heady days of when growth averaged the iea wrote
related are hedge funds pushing oil prices too high for oil bulls that should be a pretty threatening figure because demand is only expected to grow by this year
the iea acknowledges that its demand estimate could be conservative but it takes into account the fact that some demand destruction could occur from higher prices
opec pegged demand growth at a healthier but even that figure is swamped by the of new result could be a return to increases in inventories testing the current rally in prices
the iea sees a modest surplus in the first half of the year followed by a modest deficit in the second half
as such forecasts for for brent seem reasonable but that we should expect a volatile for now oil prices are struggling to hold onto their gains brent has hit the per barrel threshold but has fallen back at that resistance nick cunningham of top reads from
