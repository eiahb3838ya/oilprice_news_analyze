u.s. sanctions could add $50 to oil prices
the oil industry might not be able to produce enough oil to meet global demand in a few years be sure much of the oil world is focused on the supply fears in the
the outages in several opec nations plus the tightening noose on iran from the government could lead to a supply shortfall towards the end of this year a hole so big that saudi arabia could struggle to fill it even if it burned through much of its spare over the there are also questions about the global oil industry s ability to supply enough oil to the isn t the same peak oil theory as yesteryear but there certainly seem to be echoes of that argument bubbling up the surface once again
while the world isn t running out of oil there could be a shortage of cheap oil by the early part of the next decade
the majors have cut spending on exploration and development so drastically that there will be a dearth of new projects coming online in the next few the new on profitability at the expense of growth a mantra pressed upon oil companies by restive shareholders could keep supply iea has repeatedly warned over the past few years that shale growth would likely plateau in the which means that the world would be right back to where it started dependent on nations in the middle east
there are some shale boosters that see nothing but sunny days ahead for shale but a lot of other market watchers see shale flattening out in the next decade before entering into an extended period of decline
after that as the iea has argued the middle east will once again be the supplier of last resort
related how bad is iran s oil situation the problem is that the supply crunch might be so severe that saudi arabia won t be able to come to the something like shale is not going to really create a major dent in total global supply requirements up until saudi aramco s ceo amin nasser said in an interview with the financial times
everybody needs to do his will contribute but how much we will contribute he said a recognition that saudi arabia won t be able to do it
shale growth over the past decade has been so explosive that it helped crash oil prices in
but the supply surge masks chronic underinvestment sanford bernstein analysts wrote in a note last week
the investment manager said the newfound focus on profitability which has led a long list of oil and gas companies to deprioritize growth could create the conditions for a major supply investors who had egged on management teams to reign in capex and return cash will lament the underinvestment in the industry the analysts wrote
any shortfall in supply will result in a in prices potentially much larger than the a barrel spike witnessed in related russian oil production soars to million bpdof course for many this is a problem for another day
the oil market is arguably facing a supply crisis right now
until recently the oil market assumed a loss of about from iran because of sanctions
but statements from the government about zero tolerance towards iran could mean that those losses will end up being much higher
just by shifting the supply outages from to would translate into an oil price increase of about to per barrel according to bank of america merrill we estimate that every million shift in supply and demand balances would push the oil price by on average
so based on those assumptions we estimate zero iran exports could push oil up by if saudi caps out
we expect in this game of chicken someone will blink before that in other words if saudi arabia is unable to plug the deficit the would likely have to back down on its zero tolerance policy towards iran
the oil market is too tight and the supply gap would be too large
cutting iran exports by that much in an increasingly tight oil market would send prices skyrocketing something that the trump administration probably won t be able to stomach
if trump proceeded a price spike of that magnitude would lead to a meltdown in nick cunningham of top reads from
