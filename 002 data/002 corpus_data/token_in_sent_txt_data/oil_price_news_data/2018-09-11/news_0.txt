can oil demand really peak within 5 years?
oil demand could peak as soon as five years from the point at which the world reaches peak oil demand has become something of a cottage industry
the estimates range but tend to fall somewhere around or later
however two new predictions just out this week put peak oil demand as soon as the perhaps around much faster than almost anybody is predicting not least oil companies and their new report from the carbon tracker initiative says that a combination of technology policy and necessity will translate into a peaking of oil demand in the
by necessity carbon tracker refers to the need to transition to cleaner energy on environmental grounds and the drive to avoid the geopolitical pitfalls of energy dependence
moreover the emerging market leapfrog ultimately means that oil demand destruction could happen sooner than many people the motor of change now lies in the emerging markets which is where all the growth in energy demand lies the carbon tracker report argues
they have less fossil fuel legacy infrastructure rising energy dependency and are anxious to seize the opportunities of the renewables age
we believe it highly likely therefore that emerging markets will increasingly source their energy demand growth from renewable sources not from fossil the adoption of renewables at such a blistering rate will only be possible because costs continue to fall
carbon tracker argues that the rate of adoption for solar pv wind batteries and electric vehicles will follow an referring to a period of slow growth that suddenly morphs into a steep growth curve after it passes a certain rapid adoption of clean technologies will force a peak in fossil fuel demand
it s not a scenario it s just obvious said kingsmill bond new energy strategist and author of the carbon tracker report according to the wall street journal
related pipeline problems in the permian are overblowncarbon tracker argues that there are three types of risk stemming from the coming peak systemic risk to the financial system country risk to major oil producers and company risk to entities to fossil fuels
the total estimated value of fossil fuel infrastructure stands at about trillion the group this week a report from norwegian company dnv gl comes to a similar conclusion as carbon tracker that is peak oil demand will arrive in the next or so
the transition is undeniable said dnv ceo remi eriksen according to the the one hand predicting the peak may not seem important so long as the trajectory in a rough sense is understood oil consumption will eventually give way to efficiency and electrification
but the timing of the peak is actually pretty important because even though complete decarbonization is far off into the future the peak occurs early on in the transition
carbon tracker argues that looking at past technology transitions peak demand tends to occur when the upstart technologies capture only to percent of the importantly the period around the peak is when the incumbents start to suffer from the disruption
incumbents are typically impacted during the peaking phase because it is then that demand for their products peaks carbon tracker argued
the important measurement is not total demand but the change in demand
related is a new crisis brewing in the saudi royal family in other words while some skeptics argue that the world will need fossil fuels for decades to come that misses the importance of hitting the peak
the real pain for the fossil fuel industry comes much sooner
once the peak is hit the troubles start to accelerate
demand starts to fall so fossil fuel companies face lower prices for their products lower valuations and ultimately stranded assets
we should then expect a major reallocation of capital bankruptcy of companies that are unprepared and sector restructuring as those who prepared for the shift take over the assets of those that did not carbon tracker are not going to wait for the complete phase out of fossil fuels before they start to redeploy capital and shun fossil fuel investments that shift occurs much sooner arguably around the coal industry is a perfect example of this dynamic
coal miners have gone bankrupt share prices are in the toilet and yet coal still accounts for around a third of electricity
the disruption happened long before the phase out of coal the will still be burning coal for years it happened when demand really started to same sort of disruption could start to hit oil and gas companies as soon as the nick cunningham of top reads from
