new fuel efficiency rules could boost oil consumption
last month the trump administration announced that it would replace fuel efficiency standards enacted by the obama administration in order to make cars safer and more new proposal unveiled by the environmental protection agency and the department of transportation would freeze corporate average fuel economy cafe rules from through
under the obama plan the targets were set to rise each trump administration estimated that the new rules could prevent fatalities each year and reduce the cost of a vehicle by more than
they also claimed that the new rules would have a minimal relative impact on carbon dioxide emissions probably true but they acknowledged that the change would result in percent higher oil administration downplayed the impact of increasing oil consumption by an estimated million barrels per day stating in the proposal the is currently producing enough oil to satisfy nearly all of its energy needs and is projected to continue to do so or become a net energy exporter
this has added new stable supply to the global oil market and reduced the urgency of the to conserve i strongly disagree with this argument
while it is certainly true that oil production has soared and our net imports of petroleum and petroleum products have fallen sharply they still amount to million import around million bpd of crude oil and products with about percent of that originating from opec countries
but we also now export a significant amount of petroleum products as well as around million bpd of crude oil which is why our net imports are much lower than our crude oil imports isn t certain that the will become a net exporter of petroleum and petroleum products but in any case that s not a reason to forego conservation
there are economic reasons national security reasons and environmental reasons for conserving in discretionary oil consumption will either reduce oil imports or increase net exports
either scenario will result in an improved overall trade deficit for the for individual consumers reducing discretionary oil consumption will keep a little more money in the family budget
related hurricane danger lifts oil pricesit is also unlikely that the will be a net exporter
thus reductions to consumption will improve energy security and they will better insulate consumers against oil price are also the environmental issues to consider
oil is one of the major contributors to rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere
reducing oil consumption is a step we can take toward reining in these the production and transport of oil poses a risk of leaks and spills
as a society we agree to accept these risks when we consume oil but lowering our oil consumption would reduce the it goes without saying that oil is a finite resource
in many applications there are no economical substitutes
conserving oil will increase the lifetime of the resource and allow us more time to develop economic do what you can to conserve oil despite what the president robert rapiermore top reads from
