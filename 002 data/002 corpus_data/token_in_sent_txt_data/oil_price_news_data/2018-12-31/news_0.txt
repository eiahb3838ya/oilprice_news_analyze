the new oil order
in the decades preceding the arrival of shale oil the oil market had only one stabilizing force namely opec
the reason the oil market was structured as such was due to the nature of conventional oil production most oil production prior to shale oil fell in one of two categories major offshore projects that took to years to build north sea gulf of mexico etc
or mature conventional onshore fields conventional fields russian siberian fields etc
both of these conventional oil supply sources were either or only slowly reactive to changes in the oil price major offshore oil projects tended to come online regardless of the oil price environment while conventional onshore oil production with shallow decline rates percent meant that even a slowdown in drilling would not impact total production in any meaningful way for an extended period of aforementioned state of affairs meant that it was up to opec to adjust production to balance the market in case of abrupt supply or demand changes opec had and still has the flexibility to withdraw millions of barrels from the market within a month or two if such a need arose opec withdrawing barrels from the market following the financial crisis in is a case in point arrival of shale oil in size to the scene in has upended the balancing act by introducing a oil supply balancing mechanism that in the long run will prove supportive to the oil market and especially so to oil production trends following the oil crash in are instrumental in demonstrating the points discussed in the introduction
following the oil crash of late crude production lower declined by one million barrels eia data between december and december click to enlarge shale oil which represented percent of crude production on december barrels declined by barrels representing a percent decline during that same time frame
shale oil production declined by percent in the first year to barrels december and then declined by an additional percent in the following year to december
related venezuela a real threat to guyana oil boomthe decline in shale oil stands in contrast to oil production in the gulf of mexico which increased by percent from to barrels during the same period due to the nature of the offshore production click to enlarge the same applies to production with production remaining flat between dec and dec at around barrels click to enlarge please note the production swoon in may to was mainly due to unplanned outages in canada due to forest fires and is not related to oil prices
