canadian rig count slumps at year-end
canada s drilling rig count fell by rigs in the last week of december from a week earlier with the annual decline at rigs per the latest weekly rig count report by baker hughes
as canadian drillers gear up for winter season the rig count usually drops before the end of the year this year the figures add a more grim shade to the landscape of the canadian oil industry which this year suffered a major slump of the local benchmark western canadian select to west texas intermediate at one time dipping to a discount of over us to the last two weeks of the month and the year according to the data the number of active drilling rigs deployed in canada fell by a combined to just highlighting the effect of low local oil prices but also the obligatory production cuts enforced by the albertan government to arrest the slide in prices and clear excessive crude oil production cut will begin at a rate of bpd to be reduced to bpd once the excess supply is cleared which is expected to happen within three months
afterwards the cuts will be in place until the end of next everyone in the local oil industry is thrilled with the production cut
suncor was against it when the idea was first floated proposed by the chief executive of peer cenovus
most large companies in the field who also have processing capacity are better placed to weather the effects of the lower prices as they refine their own crude oil
premier notley has also floated the idea of building a new refinery in alberta that would absorb more of the oil that is produced in the province instead of shipping it to refiners at to canadian media reports from earlier this month albertan energy companies were interested in expanding the province s processing capacity
alberta has four refineries at present with a combined refining capacity of bpd
there are also two other specialized facilities that can refine bpd of new refinery would indeed serve to stabilize prices of canadian crude but there is one problem a refinery can not be built in a month even in a year
what s more some experts argue that canada s oil province already has too much refining capacity and the only solution to its price problem are more irina slav for top reads from
