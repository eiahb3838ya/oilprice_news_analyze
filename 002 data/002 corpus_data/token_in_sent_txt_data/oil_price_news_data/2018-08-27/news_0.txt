the permian could soon have too much pipeline capacity a glut that will present problems for midstream could be forgiven for doing a double take on that sentence
there has been a lot of attention paid to the pipeline woes in west texas but because of the unfolding shortage not a surplus
the flood of supply over the past few years suddenly ran up against a wall of fixed takeaway capacity in
the result has been maxed out pipes painful discounts for crude in midland and concerns about a production slowdown sweeping over the there is a rush to build more pipelines to load up all of that crude coming out of the ground
but with several projects in the works and set to come online essentially at the same time late and early the permian could see a massive increase in pipeline capacity hitting the market in fashion at the same permian has around million barrels per day of takeaway and local refining capacity plus some bpd of local refining capacity
the permian is producing just around which means the pipelines are nearly full or already at capacity
production is expected to continue to rise over the next year although pipeline constraints could curtail output by around to bpd barclays said a few weeks ago
still the eia sees the region adding around bpd in which will be difficult for the midstream sector to over the next two years a series of new pipelines will come online with dates scheduled close together

that discount should worsen over the next year until new pipelines come when the wave of takeaway capacity does hit the market the discount should narrow considerably
for that reason most analysts still see robust production growth in the permian and although shale drillers have seen their stock prices beaten down this year relative to their peers many market watchers are still bullish on their fortunes beyond next flip side of this dynamic is that a rush of new midstream capacity could be negative for midstream companies
a glut of pipeline space as s p global platts frames it could spell trouble for existing pipelines should shippers prefer to move barrels on newer projects which could jeopardize cash flows to infrastructure already in place if operators have to swallow lower rates and a decline in spot in fact securities analysts gave the to plains all american pipeline lp and magellan midstream partners for moving to sell the bridgetex pipeline for billion because it could lose out to newer pipelines when they come online
the assessment of that transaction is notable given the current premium placed on pipeline space right now but the analysts see the outlook a little less favorable to pipeline operators
