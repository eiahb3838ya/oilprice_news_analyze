the oil markets are at a confusing crossroads
the oil market is adequately supplied for now but the supply losses from venezuela and iran leave the market suffering from strain according to a new report from the international energy agency iea iea noted that global oil production increased by million barrels per day on a net basis since may which helped lead to an inventory build at an average rate of during the second quarter and likely the third quarter as well
as a result of a sizable stockpile of oil in storage and these higher levels of production the oil market is not in danger of shortages at the that has come at the expense of spare capacity which is already down to only percent of global demand with further reductions likely to come the iea warned
this strain could be with us for some time and it will likely be accompanied by higher prices however much we regret them and their potential negative impact on the global iran has already lost around bpd in exports and the disruptions are set to continue over the next month at least with sanctions taking effect in november
also the threat of supply disruptions from libya combined with the ongoing losses in venezuela leave the oil market a step back the iea paused to note the historic nature of today s oil market
both supply and demand are closing in on the mark for the first time
the agency used the opportunity to take a swipe at those who warned about peak oil supply
fifteen years ago forecasts of peak supply were all the rage with production from countries supposed to have started declining by now the iea said
in fact production has surged led by the us shale revolution and supported by big increases in brazil canada and elsewhere
in future a lot of potential supply could come to the market from places like iran iraq libya nigeria and venezuela if their various challenges can be related will big oil ever win back investors trust global production has climbed significantly over the last decade or so led by the shale revolution but it seems a little presumptuous to feel confident about the future of supply when it rests on iran iraq libya nigeria and venezuela as if their various challenges can so easily be when has it ever been the case that such serious challenges can simply be overcome just because the market wants their oil not only does the iea not subscribe to peak supply but it warns that peak demand may be far off as well
the drivers of demand remain very powerful and consumption is set to continue to climb higher in the years ahead
transportation will continue to grow although at a slower pace as electric vehicles begin to take over
but surging petrochemical production and the consumption of plastics will push oil consumption to ever greater heights the agency believes
not only did peak supply never arrive the iea argues but t here is no peak in sight for demand plenty of other analysts dispute this but demand is at least set to grow in the short run
however the sudden concerns over the health of the global economy brought into stark relief this week by the worldwide selloff in equities could spell trouble for the oil market
the warnings signs are in plain sight rising interest rates faltering data on exports and industrial activity concerns about china s economy the trade war dollar strength and emerging market currency trouble
then of course there is higher oil prices to contend eia market tightens as outages from iran venezuela pile upin the face of these headwinds the iea downgraded its forecast for oil demand growth by bpd for both and leaves the oil market kind of at a confusing crossroads
supply is likely adequate in the but low spare capacity leaves the world dangerously exposed
iran s exports will continue to fall any additional outage could push prices flip side of this coin is that demand looks shakier than it has at any point in recent years
not only is demand is set to grow at a slower pace than expected but if analysts are going to be wrong on the specific figures they are likely going to be
the stock market selloff over the past week has raised a lot of alarm bells with a growing number of market watchers worried about a forthcoming global recession financial nick cunningham of top reads from
