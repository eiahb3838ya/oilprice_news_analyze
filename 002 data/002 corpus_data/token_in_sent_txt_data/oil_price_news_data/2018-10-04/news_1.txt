big oil is back on a spending spree
big its smaller a lot of praise for their tight financial discipline during the last three years after brent collapsed from more than us a barrel to less than us in less than months
some actually thought this may be the new normal financial discipline tight belts and careful scrutiny of any new projects
reality seems to have proven them reported this week that big oil companies boards are under increasing pressure to boost spending expand production and increase reserves
that s just three years after everyone in oil woke up to the fact that brent was going nowhere but down for a while longer and belts started tightening
now with brent at us and climbing these belts are getting too tight it seems
despite pledges made by the chief executive officers of the biggest oil companies in the world the strict financial discipline they had imposed during the rough years might now have to be quoted sources from the sector that said various departments within them were asking for more money videoconferencing was being replaced by meetings which are costlier because of travel expenses and offshore platform rotas are being shortened which raises logistics costs
all this suggests big oil is relaxing and is ready to start spending more s in july said in a note to clients the five biggest oil companies would spend percent more in than in the current year
the ratings agency whose note forbes gaurav sharma quoted in a july story said higher oil prices were helping big oil report more substantial profits and these profits in turn were spurring a more upbeat attitude towards higher this sound familiar
it must because that s how all oil cycles have worked
assurances from the this time everything will be different may very well have been premature and overoptimistic
reuters john kemp put it succinctly in a commentary from april the oil industry has been characterised by deep and prolonged cycles since the first modern well was drilled in
deep cycles are the natural condition of the oil industry and there is no reason to think the future will be any related is china turning trump oil weapon against him the oil industry can not escape from its cyclical nature no matter how many mistakes it learns from but there are two areas that really do require higher spending and there are doubts that big oil will be able to provide it regardless of the current oil price rally
these two are reserve replacement and climate reported in its story that the oil field decline rate accelerated from percent in to percent in
sure spending cuts had something to do with this but there is also such a thing as natural depletion that has nothing to do with spending finite resources
so higher spending to ensure stable production in spite of the doomsayers eager to usher in a totally renewable era in energy is higher spending on cleaner energy is also inevitable big oil has been increasingly vocal about its commitments to the world of tomorrow where oil and gas will be a much smaller part of the energy mix
to live up to their promise these companies will need to spend twice as much on new energy as they are spending now morgan stanley warned in a report from last month cited by bloomberg
in this context it would be safe to say that big oil is entering the next stage of the new cycle and it will be spending more in the coming years
until the next price drop that irina slav for top reads from
