is the threat of high oil prices overstated?
as sanctions on iran have forced some countries to stop importing oil from iran crude oil prices have inevitably risen
the started down this path earlier this year when president trump announced the withdrawal from the iran nuclear sanctions went into effect in august but the sanctions with potentially the most significant global implications go into effect in november when the sanctions target iran s oil may of this year iran exported million barrels of oil per day which accounted for nearly of the world s daily crude oil consumption
the new sanctions are expected to impact about million bpd of iran s pressure from the many countries have begun to reduce oil exports from iran
as the market has slowly absorbed the implications of this loss crude oil prices have steadily risen
as recently as august a barrel of brent crude oil was still in the upper
today the price has risen to a high
west texas intermediate is now over was entirely predictable
the world simply does not currently have a lot of spare crude oil capacity
but there is a widespread belief that the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec has excess capacity that can be used to offset the loss of iranian fact president trump has tweeted his ire at opec on several occasions most recently on september when he wrote we protect the countries of the middle east they would not be safe for very long without us and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices
we will remember
the opec monopoly must get prices down now
related what drove brent above saudi arabia claims about million bpd of spare capacity but that would take their production to an high
a number of people have asked if i believe their claim
yes i think they do have some excess capacity but the bulk of that is reserved for true emergencies
high oil prices do not constitute an true emergency would be the outbreak of violence in a major country that took millions of barrels offline
in other words a sudden unexpected event that rocks that oil saudi arabia and russia rebuffed president trump s request
saudi energy minister khalid stated the markets are adequately supplied
i don t know of any refiner in the world who is looking for oil and is not able to get privately saudi arabia is expected to increase production somewhat to offset iran s lost barrels
it won t be enough to make up for all of iran s lost exports and it will put the world in a more precarious situation in case of a real emergency
but it may be enough to stave off a quick return to as some analysts are robert rapiermore top reads from
