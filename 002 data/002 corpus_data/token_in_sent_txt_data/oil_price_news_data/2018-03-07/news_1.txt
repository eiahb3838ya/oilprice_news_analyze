the only oil major not buying into the permian
the permian has been attracting independent drillers and oil majors who want to capitalize on returns in the world s hottest shale play but one of the world s supermajors is not joining the large comprised of drillers that are jumping on the shale s competitors exxon chevron and shell thinks that the permian is not the best allocation of capital to create value for the company and its at the ceraweek in houston this week total s ceo patrick pouyanné told ihs markit s vice chairman daniel yergin that choosing where to invest is a question of allocation of what we learn from this low cycle is that you can t do everything pouyanné said adding that it doesn t make sense for total and its investors to allocate capital to gain access to the permian to produce bpd of its competitors total doesn t have a position in the permian and it would be quite costly to try to gain one at this point in the game
for this reason the permian is not a priority for the french company according to its chief i have nothing against the permian pouyanné was quick to say adding that i think it s an incredible area for competitors who already have positions for a company like total it s not just a matter of ticking the box to produce bpd it makes no sense the ceo said adding that when i think of areas of investment i need to target bpd if i m a serious related shale pioneer issues warning to drillers i don t think it s the best allocation of capital
having said that never say never the earth is but it s not a priority total s ceo said at the the one hand pouyanné s words highlight the fact that the the world s hottest shale play now too crowded for latecomers and the cost of accessing acreage is not worth the value that such a position could create
on the other hand the comments show that total currently has other priority areas in which to profit so it can return more of those profits to said those priority areas are the middle east africa the north sea deepwater and liquefied natural gas lng i prefer to spend my money on these five strengths with the intent to be a leader in each of them pouyanné i strongly believe that for our investors playing to our strengths has much more sense to create value than just trying to fill the i love the middle east pouyanné said at ceraweek noting the oil and gas positions it has in abu dhabi qatar and africa total has just boosted its upstream libyan operations by acquiring the stake of the waha oil concessions held by marathon oil corporation for us ceraweek pouyanné said that this acquisition was one of the best deals i ve ever made because it gave total access to vast oil resources
acknowledging the geopolitical and risks of doing business in africa and the middle east pouyanné said that there can t be opportunities without the north sea the acquisition of maersk oil that will close on march is strengthening total s business and creates synergies to further push costs down pouyanné deepwater total sanctioned in december the first development phase of the libra project offshore brazil with technical costs below a barrel and last month bought exploration licenses offshore guyana where exxon has just made its seventh oil lng total has recently bought engie s portfolio of upstream lng assets becoming the global lng player behind shell
related oil prices rebound after eia reports build in crude inventorieswhile oil has been predominantly associated with the permian total has a different concept of short cycle
for pouyanné short cycle means being able to turn on and turn off contractors and that the permian will continue to boost its production total s ceo still doesn t think that the area is the best allocation for his company s capital especially without any existing position an interview with bloomberg on the sidelines of ceraweek pouyanné said total today is the most profitable major company without any by tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
