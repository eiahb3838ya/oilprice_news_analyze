u.s. oil export boom boosts pipeline demand
the could add around million barrels per day of additional supply in the coming years and most of it will be shipped abroad turning the into a major oil of the new supply will come in the form of light sweet and oil
but because refineries along the gulf coast are largely equipped to handle medium and heavy crude the new production probably won t find a home inside the new study from wood mackenzie predicts that only about bpd of the additional supply will be taken up in the domestic market leaving more than for export should those aggressive production forecasts play out
meanwhile bernstein research was even more definitive arguing that essentially all new additional supply will be shipped the iea forecasts that crude export capacity could hit nearly by estimates that initially a lot of the exported crude will head to europe where refining values are high
however oil will have to compete with crude coming from west africa
once the european market is saturated shale oil will be rerouted to asia
hefty transportation costs to asia will force shipments to be offered at a steep discount if they are to be competitive
nevertheless it seems likely that exports will steadily ratchet the flood of new oil coming from the shale fields will require an overhaul of pipeline and export terminals along the gulf coast

already the basin is facing pipeline bottlenecks forcing producers to wait to complete drilled wells

new pipelines the bridgetex permian express and cactus pipelines have begun ferrying permian oil to the coast of texas in the past two years erasing what had once been a steep discount for midland crude relative to wti due to the infrastructure with output in the permian continuing to rise at a rapid clip more capacity is needed
for instance the cactus pipeline network is set to add two more lines expanding capacity from bpd to bpd
the lines run from the permian to corpus christi and the expansion is expected to come online by the end of next an estimated of midstream capacity is under construction according to rbn energy and cited by the everybody wants to get to water corey prologo director of north american oil trading at trafigura told the ceraweek conference on tuesday the ft reported
