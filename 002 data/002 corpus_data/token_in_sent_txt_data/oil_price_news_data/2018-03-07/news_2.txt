malaysian petronas sees profits rise by 91%
malaysian oil and gas giant petronas is back in the game
after a series of steps or rather missteps including being involved in high profile corruption scandals and after receiving a bloody nose from an overbearing and cumbersome approval process in canada for its now cancelled bn pacific northwest lng export project the company will ramp up its growth and spending plans this year following a sharp rise in to deep spending cuts and higher oil prices petronas said net profit for the fourth quarter ending in december increased to billion ringgit us billion from billion ringgit in the same quarter last year
revenue rose percent to billion ringgit
moreover the biggest from the petronas disclosure is yearly profits up some percent in from the previous year
this marks the second consecutive year of profitability for the company following a profit slump largely coming amid then plunging global oil and gas prices that set the global oil and gas industry on a downward spiral from which is now still recovering petronas profit growth of percent pales in comparison to this year s impressive growth
the company s profit after tax pat for jumped to billion ringgit compared to billion ringgit recorded in
the increase was achieved on the back of higher revenue lower net impairment on assets and well costs and continuous efforts to optimise costs in petronas said in a release on march profits equal more projectsamid its improved financials petronas is now in a stronger position to execute its growth strategy the company oil prices rebound after eia reports build in crude inventoriesthe significance of the petronas disclosure is at least
first though the company has made a comeback global oil and gas prices need to remain near current levels or higher to sustain positive financial it appears that in the according to most projections that global oil prices should remain in the high to low range for the balance of the year and into next year in the now increasingly changing world of oil and gas markets particularly with us shale oil and gas changing both fundamental and structural market dynamics nothing can be taken for president and ceo wan zulkiflee also alluded to this when he said that industry wide costs are showing signs of increasing driven by what he called premature exuberance over the oil price recovery
it is imperative we do not drop the austerity mindset and continue to ensure we keep costs under control increase efficiency and drive up value he from the uptick in petronas profitability is that it could try to go long again on gas development in canada despite the fact that the firm pulled up stakes there in early petronas and its project partners cited lower global energy prices as the reason for cancelling its massive capex project regulatory environmental and aboriginal resistance in british columbia the site of the proposed project was likely just as much of a determining factor
media in the western canadian province at the time said that petronas cancellation was a tragedy for now petronas could choose an easier point of entry into canada
on monday major chevron said that it was exploring options including the sale of a minority stake in its canadian lng project as it pushes ahead
people familiar with the matter told reuters that chevron might sell a stake in its kitimat lng project
petronas is one of the interested petronas did indeed secure a stake in the project which is a joint venture with australia s woodside petroleum it could help the company s goal of furthering its lng footprint away from its own market and shell outsmarts competition in the gulf of mexicothe region represents around of all lng demand while that figure will increase as china s ramps up its usage to at least percent of its energy mix needed for power generation by per a government mandate
further increases are earmarked for and chance at redemptionuntil recently it seemed that canada s lng export plans had died an untimely death due to governmental red tape while the upstart industry with less capex intensive projects and an easier approval process passed it by without even bothering to check its rear view granted it s too late for canada to even come close to matching the impressive lng run as the country positions itself to have five major lng export projects in operation by the end of the decade and soon after that even challenging top lng exporters qatar and australia a window is now opening again for canadian lng exports
the question remains as before can canada step up the plate and deliver that answer is up to canadian politicians and officials that need to carefully weigh their regulatory policies and decisions
a second chance like this albeit in global energy markets doesn t often come while there is a slim chance that if missed again a third opportunity will present tim daiss for top reads from
