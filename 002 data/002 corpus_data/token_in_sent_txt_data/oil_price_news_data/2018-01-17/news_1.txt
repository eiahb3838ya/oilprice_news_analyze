cnpc expects robust oil demand growth in china
china s oil and gas giant cnpc has just added fuel to already strong optimism on oil markets by forecasting that crude oil demand in china will jump by percent this year to million barrels per imports the news is even better for producers cnpc sees net crude oil imports at percent above levels to million metric tons or about million barrels per day
the forecast is based on estimated gdp expansion of percent slightly down from percent in year china overtook the united states as the world s largest oil importer with its dependency on imports reaching percent
this year this could climb further to percent even if there is a recovery in domestic is some bad news for refiners in the rest of asia however
cnpc s economics and technology research institute which compiled the report expects net oil product exports export minus imports this year to soar by almost a third to million tons with diesel exports shooting up by percent thanks to higher export domestic chinese market is in a glut of oil products so higher quotas are very likely to be allowed to relieve it
however this will undermine the margins of other asian refiners who are already facing an uphill battle because of more expensive crude oil
