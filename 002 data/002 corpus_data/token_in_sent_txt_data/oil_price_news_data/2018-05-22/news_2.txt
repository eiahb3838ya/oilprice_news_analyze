could venezuela prompt opec to pump more?
venezuela s oil industry is collapsing fast
no wonder then that opec is finally talking about perhaps raising production to make up for venezuela s overdelivering on production cuts
as reuters reported yesterday the cartel is looking closely at the country s oil production to make sure it is low enough for other members to step in and start pumping opec is talking about taking action this means it is not too happy with oil prices at the current level which at the time of writing was us a barrel for brent and us a barrel for energy ministers of saudi arabia and the uae already said as much they last week said there was no fundamental reason for brent to trade at over us a was enough supply to compensate for any losses when sanctions against iran kick in later this year
now other opec officials are practically admitting that brent at us or more may not be the best price level for is an interesting development
venezuela s oil production is now at the lowest in about seven decades at just million bpd and all signs point towards a further decline after the of nicolas maduro and the very good chance for more punitive action from washington which will no doubt target the country s battered oil industry
even without any further sanctions from the venezuela has no money to maintain its oil production let alone increase should be grateful to venezuela thanks to this inexorable slide in venezuelan oil production the cartel exceeded its overall production quota under the cuts deal in some months by a wide margin pushing prices to highs
venezuela s oil industry collapse also compensated for higher than agreed production in some opec members such as iraq
as a result of all this we got brent at us which is what some opec members wanted
related oil majors double down on refiningnow opec is considering taking action and this is telling
despite the upbeat rhetoric from khalid and a number of investment bank commodity analysts who have argued in recent weeks that before oil prices start hurting demand brent could climb above us opec is already considering action with brent at us
could it be that these upbeat predictions were a little bit off the mark if we leave geopolitical risk aside the fundamental factors driving prices higher in the last couple months were tightening supply from opec thanks to the cuts and venezuela and stronger demand especially in asia
also analyst wildly lost iranian supply following the reintroduction of sanctions helped
this stronger demand by the way has been one of the top arguments of oil bulls in support of their expectations that even brent at us won t hurt china has made it clear it will continue buying crude for iran with or without sanctions so the effect of these sanctions on supply is likely to be a lot milder than the last time when the west imposed sanctions on iran
china in other words has secured the supply to match its demand even with opec production at current levels and it will likely prefer iranian crude to other opec crude because it can pay for it in yuan
related india to saudi arabia we need stable and moderate oil pricesindia has asked saudi arabia for assurances that oil prices will remain stable and moderate noting that us is way above reasonable
the message could not be clearer brent at us is already a problem for the world s consumer
therefore assured his indian counterpart dharmendra pradhan that opec will make an effort to ensure availability of adequate supplies to offset any potential shortfalls
so opec is right to look closely at oil industry developments in venezuela although there will hardly be any surprises coming from there
the time may have come to start easing the production quotas as russia s alexander novak suggested at an earlier meeting with opec ministers
