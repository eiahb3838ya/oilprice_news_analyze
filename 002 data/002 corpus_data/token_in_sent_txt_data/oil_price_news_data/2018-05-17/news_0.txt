u.s. oil exports continue to break records
crude oil exports broke yet another record spiking to million barrels per day for the week ending on may
with shale surging and export terminals retooling on the gulf coast the export surge is likely set to export figures bounce around quite a bit from week to week but the trend has been sharply up over the past year rising from the level to routinely topping million barrels per day more recently
the latest week put crude exports above for the first time
obviously the surge in shale production is a large part of the reason
refiners have swallowed up a large portion of the enormous increase in shale supply over the past few years but there is a limit to how much they can take on
moreover the type of oil that refiners can handle is not perfectly suited to the type of oil coming out of texas shale fields
many of the gulf coast refiners are best equipped to handle medium and heavy types of oil while shale drillers are extracting light and sweet oil from west texas
that leaves a lot left over for a strong driver of higher oil exports recently is the discount for american crude
the discount of wti to brent has widened this year from around per barrel in early to a much more pronounced discount recently
in late april the discount hit per barrel and by the discount exploded to about per barrel
related the regulations that could push oil up to discount has continued to widen as the conditions between the american market and the rest of the world diverge
opec is keeping barrels off of the market helping to drain inventories back to average levels
the supply losses in venezuela and angola have tightened the market faster than most analysts expected
plus the potential losses from iran because of sanctions have also led to supply fears
all of this has put a premium on brent relative to in the the story is the same that it has been for the past year shale continues to add new supply at an amazing rate
to be sure pipeline bottlenecks could significantly slow that growth rate but any curtailment in supply has yet to show up in the end result is that cheap american crude makes it exceptionally attractive to foreign buyers
an discount is definitely large enough to cover the transit costs of shipping oil over long distances to asia
oil exports to asia are expected to hit a record high in july according to reuters after hitting a record high in may at close to million barrels
reuters cites data from oil traders who note that close to supertankers each carrying million barrels are queued up to load oil in the before they set sail for wti midland is coming across an unnamed oil trader told reuters
wti midland can now compete against middle eastern oil in asia
wti midland trades at a premium to dubai benchmark quotes for delivery in asia although there are significant differences in hurdle for higher oil exports of crude oil is the inability of gulf coast ports to handle very large crude carriers vlccs
ports along the gulf coast are inland and don t have the width or depth to handle such large ships
most gulf coast oil ports can handle aframax vessels which carry to million barrels
but the number of ports that can handle even suezmax ships to million barrels is limited according to the eia
vlccs at up to million barrels are simply too export oil from these ports smaller ships are used to ferry oil from the port out to a vlcc
but that adds time and costs which means that in order to economically support crude exports from these terminals a wider discount is now only the louisiana offshore oil port loop can handle vlccs
and that port only brought that capability online in february
weekly exports of crude oil have surpassed million four times so far in and trade press reports indicate two of those weeks of february and march with weeks in which loop loaded a vlcc for export the eia wrote in a report on may
upgrades to a handful of other ports on the gulf coast are in the works but those will take time to reach the price differential between wti and brent narrow there could be a cap placed on the volume of crude exports leaving the
however for now the discount is wide enough leaving the window open for higher oil nick cunningham of top reads from
