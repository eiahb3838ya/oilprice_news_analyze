permian bottlenecks come at the worst moment
the growing number of supply outages around the world are causing the oil market to become a lot more volatile putting extra emphasis on every barrel that does or does not make it to market
that makes the infrastructure bottlenecks in west texas a global is quite a bit of debate about what s going on in the permian and whether or not the shale industry will be able to keep up with heady production forecasts
the iea predicts the will add million barrels per day in followed by another in the bulk of that is expected to come from the permian and while the iea acknowledges pipeline bottlenecks in the permian it has not significantly altered its supply forecast
while producers are bumping up against pipeline bottlenecks supplies will continue to rise through the iea said in its june oil market report

that makes projections like the ones from places like the iea look a bit optimistic almost as if growth was simply extrapolated are more pessimistic
we will reach capacity in the next to months scott sheffield the chairman of pioneer natural resources told bloomberg last month
some companies will have to shut in production some companies will move rigs away and some companies will be able to continue growing because they have firm transportation
the permian has roughly of takeaway capacity plus local refining capacity
there is theoretically some bpd of train capacity but a lot of that is being used to move frac sand according to s p global platts

it s a trip and on the low side it s at least per barrel probably more like to trip rogers a portfolio manager at bp capital fund advisors told
he added that shipping oil by pipeline only adds to per about bpd is moving by truck and that figure could be capped at bpd because of constraints on trucking according to s p global platts
there is already a nationwide shortage of truckers and the cost of moving oil hundreds of miles from west texas to the coast means that trucking is ultimately not really a viable solution in any big a result the pipeline bottleneck will become more acute as the year wears on
by the end of permian production could exceed available pipeline space by to bpd according to bp capital fund advisors
by late the gap could reach hefty discount could deter well completions
indeed the number of drilled but uncompleted wells continues to rise by with each passing month topping in bp capital fund advisors argues that the beating that permian shale drillers have taken in terms of their share prices is overly severe and particularly short sighted due to the temporary nature of the bottleneck and the attractiveness of stacked pay zones in the permian which make drilling much more profitable than elsewhere

we have seen that a bit
yeah
and i think that s logical for those companies to have those options
it does make sense
we have seen that in some areas we have seen some rigs relocated trip rogers of bp capital fund advisors said
some companies have said they expect that completions could be down to conocophillips said it is pulling back from the permian although its retreat will be temporary as it awaits more pipelines towards late and
halcon resources recently decided to scrap one rig and c j energy services delayed three fleets that were supposed to be heading into operation in october according to s p global platts
overall the permian has lost four rigs since late may while the eagle ford has gained out the troubles in the permian will be felt worldwide
because so many oil market forecasts assume large growth from the permian the notion that shale will undershoot expectations could present upside risk to oil prices
it s a big impact
i think it played a big factor in opec s decision last week rogers said
it adds to the overall tightness of the global oil by nick cunningham of top reads from
