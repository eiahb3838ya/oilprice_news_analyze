the new oil cartel threatening opec
when reports emerged that india and china are in talks about forming an oil buyers club opec was probably too busy with its upcoming june meeting to concern itself with that dangerous alliance
now it may be time for it to start the timing is right
the boom in oil and gas production gives us greater leverage against opec the times of india quoted an indian official as saying last month after the formal start of said talks
the two countries after all account for a combined percent of global oil consumption and they are the ones that would be the hardest hit if prices rise as a result of opec s s more they might not be alone in this attempt to curb opec s clout on the global oil market
according to bloomberg s carl pope europe and japan previously reluctant to take part in any projects may now join in
the reason they are likely to join in is that unlike in previous oil price cycles now there are alternatives to fossil fuels
electrification is where opec may have to face off with a future oil buyers china and europe are all very big on ev adoption
japan is a leader in battery manufacturing
if they set their minds to it these four players could upend the oil market and effectively cripple opec
of course this is a scenario of the kind that rarely unfolds in reality
related why oil prices are surginglet s take india for example
a recent survey suggested that as many as percent of indian drivers were willing to switch to evs if the government built the necessary charging infrastructure reduced road taxes and increased subsidies
another survey identified price and range as additional roadblocks towards the mass adoption of evs in india
because of these challenges new delhi recently amended its ambitious goal of having an fleet on the roads of the country by to having percent of the fleet for its part is the undisputed leader in global ev adoption the country accounted for more than percent of global ev sales last year in case you were thinking wait wasn t that norway however this was in large part made possible by generous government subsidies for ev manufacturing
these subsidies are due to be wound down to by and carmakers are already beginning to brace for a future without the support of the state
it s safe to say it remains uncertain if the ev boom will continue after precarious situation with evs is reason enough for china and india to seek more clout on international oil markets dominated by opec and would justify the formation of a buyers europe for its part is as a whole a top performer in ev adoption and it is also very big on environmentalism
at the same time it still imports crude and quite a lot of it so it cares about oil prices as a large buyer

europe could help and benefit from it
after all taken together europe china india and japan account for the manufacturing of as much as percent of the world s cars and a lot of these are manufactured in europe
these four also consume percent of the world s crude oil and would like to reduce this to pope if they get together they would be able to negotiate either a more gradual or a faster shift to evs
it would all depend on whether opec would agree to maintain lower prices or more skeptical view would note the challenges in ev adoption such as subsidies and infrastructure
these would take time to be overcome even if everyone played together
yet an oil buyers alliance could be a force to be reckoned with by the oil producers and the latter need to start paying attention irina slav for top reads from
