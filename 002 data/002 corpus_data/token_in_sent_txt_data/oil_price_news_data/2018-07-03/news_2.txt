do crude producers really want higher oil prices?
major states buying oil from iran are unlikely to heed the call to drop imports key allies want a waiver to avoid sanctions opec meanwhile will have trouble boosting output in the the puzzle is not solved but there are dark clouds history may have registered stranger bedfellows
but in the current world the rules of the game are now de facto controlled by opec powerhouse saudi arabia in concert with may even join opec as an associate member
there s a key clause in the bilateral agreement stipulating that joint interventions to raise or lower oil production now are the new major opec members are not exactly pleased
at the recent meeting in vienna three member states iran iraq and venezuela tried but did not manage to veto the drive for increased production
venezuela s production is actually declining
iran facing a tacit declaration of economic war is to increase production
and iraq s will need time to boost sachs insists the oil market remains in requiring higher core opec and russia production to avoid a by goldman sachs expects production by opec and russia to rise by million barrels a day by the end of
persian gulf traders have told asia times that s unrealistic goldman sachs does not have the figures to assert the capability of russia and saudi arabia to produce so much oil
at most that would be a million barrels a day
and it is doubtful russia will seek to damage iran even if they had the in theory russia and iran both under sanctions coordinate their energy policy
both are interested in countering the shale industry
top energy analysts consider that only with oil at a barrel will fracking become highly profitable
and oil and gas generated via fracked in the is a thing it will largely be exhausted in years
moreover the real story may be that shale oil is in the end nothing but a ponzi were the days when the obama administration ordered riyadh to unleash a de facto war to hurt both russia and iran
yet the game drastically changes when venezuela loses a million barrels a day in production and iran under upcoming sanctions may lose another asia times has reported opec plus russia can at best increase their production by million barrels a day
and that would take time because as persian gulf traders said barrels a day of their cutback is due to depletion that can not be oil producers don t want high pricesmost nations don t want high oil prices
when that happens demand goes down and the dreaded competition in the form of electric vehicles gets a major explains in part why riyadh prevailed in the war in vienna
saudi arabia is the only producer with some spare capacity the real numbers are a source of endless debate in energy circles
iran for its part is in acute need of extra energy income and had to be against it
related sanctions on iran may send oil prices above next yearthe bottom line is that despite the agreement in vienna the price of oil in the is bound to go up
analyses by bnp paribas among others are adamant that supply problems with venezuela and libya plus the proverbial uncertainty about the sanctions on iran lead to oil fundamentals for oil prices to rise over the next six months despite the iran s petroleum minister bijan zanganeh has done his best to downplay how much oil will really be back on the market
in tandem with persian gulf traders he certainly knows that can t be more than million barrels a day and that such an output boost will take that in realpolitik terms riyadh simply is not allowed any decision in oil policy without clearing it first with the what remains to be seen is how washington will react to the new entente cordiale
as far as oil geopolitics goes this is in fact the major
business as usualthe big unknown is how the economic war on iran s oil exports will play s zanganeh has been quite realistic he does not expect buyers to get any sanctions waivers from washington
total and royal dutch shell have already stopped s top oil customers are in order china india south korea and will buy iranian oil with rupees
china also will be totally impervious to the trump administration s command
sinopec for instance badly needs iranian oil for new refineries in assorted chinese provinces and won t stop s economy minister nihat zeybekci has been blunt the decisions taken by the united states on this issue are not binding for he added that we recognize no other country s interests other than our iran is turkey s oil supplier accounting for almost of total iraq won t abandon strategic energy cooperation with iran
supply chains rule baghdad sends oil from kirkuk to a refinery in kermanshah in iran and gets refined iranian oil for southern won t back down from its intention to invest billion in iran s energy and south korea are lobbying heavily to get waivers
according to south korea s energy ministry we are in the same position as japan
we are in talks with the united states and will keep negotiating to get an exemption a less hobbesian world the france uk and germany plus china and russia which all negotiated the iran nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa along with japan and south korea would be telling the the trump administration s unilateral economic war against iran is in fact a violation of a treaty totally disregarding nations that have pledged to protect the jcpoa
in the real world though that s not going to s all about energyonce again the action to watch will be at the shanghai energy stock exchange
contracts started trading in late march
by may they were already covering of the global market
the price of a barrel of oil in yuan has oscillated between brent and west texas intermediate wti
related saudi arabia won t bring million bpd onlinechina is going no holds barred betting simultaneously on saudi arabia and iran
china investment may well buy of aramco at roughly billion
in parallel china started paying for iranian oil in yuan in
if the europeans buckle up as top iranian analysts expect the volume of energy business with china may soon reach billion a is firmly linked to the
iran now may rely on a fleet of supertankers properly insured to export its own oil
the iranian calculation is that washington s economic war will spur higher oil prices
so even if iran s exports are bound to suffer energy income may not be by all these dramatic eruptions we find some startling data
iran and russia may sit on an astonishing trillion worth in oil and gas reserves
fracking is largely a myth
saudi arabia may have at best years of oil supply left
it s all about energy all the usual suspects will hardly sit back and relax while endlessly demonized russia just like norway builds a solid middle class through oil revenue and massive current account surpluses
