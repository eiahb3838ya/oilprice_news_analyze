the truth about aramcoâ€™s $2 trillion valuation
two trillion dollars this was the price tag riyadh put on the jewel in its crown state oil and gas giant aramco
this is how much the company was worth officials said if you multiplied its proven reserves by a factor of us which is the figure used to value oil and gas were doubts about that valuation from the start and now these are deepening as the company crawls closer to the initial public offering
for starters aramco s opacity was very likely to make potential investors has never published financial reports
although there were assurances that it will start doing so ahead of the ipo to date the latest entry on aramco s corporate reports page is from july last year and includes production figures for
last year sources had told reuters the company was planning to start publishing financial reports early this year but this has not happened these concerns aside there is the bigger problem of the valuation methodology itself
in a blunt but very informative story for bloomberg gadfly liam denning suggests that aramco may need crude oil at us a barrel to get the us valuation it claims it has
that s in addition to making several wild assumptions along the oil world today is different from what it was just five years ago
the oil price collapse taught oil producers to be more economical and to pick their projects more carefully to keep cash flows coming in and sharing them with shareholders
yes they had to sell additional stock and some suspended dividends but the lesson was learned and the moment prices started perking up dividends returned and stock was bought things you didn t know about oilyields are what investors want when they consider whether to invest in a company denning says
they don t care about proven reserves and production costs as such
instead they care about how these can turn into dividends
it s as simple as that but this is where it stops being average free cash flow yield of the global oil supermajors is between and percent
russia s rosneft while not a supermajor per se sports the highest one at percent while exxon has the lowest at percent
based on these actual figures denning makes an entertaining set of calculations involving major assumptions about the price of oil aramco s production and costs and profit result is that to lure investors with a cash flow yield the minimum that would make it competitive aramco needs oil to sell for us a barrel
this is the only scenario where it can be valued at us trillion the only scenario out of all based on favorable is not going up to us anytime soon unless something cataclysmic happens
denning is also factoring in the inherent regional risk in the middle east that is likely to act as a deterrent to potential investors
the publicity machine around the ipo has begun to creak already
recently all those suspecting aramco won t make its own deadline for the ipo had to pleasure to be proved right saudi officials said it will be delayed until next bloomberg is reporting that investors have misgivings about the ipo
citing sources wishing to remain unnamed bloomberg had this to say among the issues raised were the trillion valuation saudi arabia wants for the world s largest oil producer the scale of dividends aramco s prepared to pay and the impact of the shale boom on oil prices over the next few investors want cash not massive reserves
maybe this would prove a lesson aramco has to learn the hard irina slav for top reads from
