why u.s. oil exports are surging
crude oil exports are surging and going to a growing number of buyers around the world including to the demand centers in asia the traditional stronghold of the middle eastern oil production expanding pipeline and export capacity and the more than discount of wti spot prices to brent supported the surge in oil exports last year it looks like these three key drivers of american production higher capacity and higher here to stay leading to a continued increase in overseas shipments much to the frustration of opec exporters whose market share of the prized asian market is starting to the second full year since the restrictions on crude oil exports were removed in late american oil exports almost doubled compared to averaging million bpd the eia said this shipped its oil to countries last year up from in
canada was still the biggest export market for oil but its total share dropped to percent last year from percent in
the most notable increase in exports was recorded in none other than china where russia and saudi arabia have been competing for years for the top spot with russia having gained the upper hand in the past two
crude oil exports to china accounted for the total increase in american exports in eia data showed
china surpassed the united kingdom and the netherlands to become the destination for crude oil exports last year just behind large asian crude oil importer india which had not received any oil in bought bpd in to tie with spain as the destination of american crude s not only the high production that drove the increased exports the spread was a major incentive last year
spot brent prices averaged a barrel more than wti prices in compared with just a barrel more in providing a price incentive to export crude oil into the international market the eia said
related canada is facing a heavy crude crisisaccording to the eia this year similar production infrastructure and price conditions will be necessary to keep exports trending upwards
and it looks like all these conditions are likely to be fulfilled in crude oil production will average million bpd in up from the average million bpd in and wti prices will average a barrel lower than brent prices in both and the eia said in its latest energy favorable spread for far this year total oil production has already surpassed that of opec s leading producer saudi arabia and the united states is on track to topple russia to become the world s largest crude oil producer as early as later this year the international energy agency iea export capacity the louisiana offshore oil port loop recently shipped out oil on the largest sized supertanker there is after the port expanded to accommodate the bigger vessels
these supertankers capable of carrying million barrels of oil could reduce shipping costs thus making exports even more attractive especially on routes to the markets in exports to asia are eating into opec producers market share and threatening to unravel the production cut deal warren patterson a commodities strategist at dutch bank ing groep nv told bloomberg they continue to give market share away to the patterson said referring to opec s
exports will continue to rise in the medium term and by the united states will be the fourth biggest oil exporter in the world behind saudi arabia russia and iraq energy consultancy wood mackenzie said at the end of january
the will export million bpd of light sweet crude of api gravity of between and by woodmac has will continue to import heavy oil but its light crude will find a market thanks to global demand growth estimated at million bpd over the next few things you didn t know about oil opec producers and others will compete for market share but as the marginal supplier we expect tight oil to capture the lion s share of incremental growth woodmac rising shale production is expected to have a lasting effect on crude price differentials
the brent premium over wti has averaged under per barrel over the last three years but woodmac expects it to be around per barrel in the coming far higher production and export capacity and the brent premium over wti are shaping up favorably for american exports that are already upending global oil markets
how far the disruption will go and how fast the could become a top five global oil exporter will depend on oil prices and spreads the pace of production growth and a possible response from opec if it soon decides it is time it started to defend its market tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
