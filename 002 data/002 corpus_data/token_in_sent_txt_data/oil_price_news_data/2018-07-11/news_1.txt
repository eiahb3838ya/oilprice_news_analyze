oil’s perfect storm lays at trump’s feet
it s becoming painfully clear that the way forward for global oil markets is going to be bumpy very bumpy particularly as we head into next year
much of this uncertainty even blame is being increasingly leveled at a person that has surprised flabbergasted and even shocked political opponents allies and adversaries alike since he took office president donald growing line of thought surmises that while trump uses the presidential bully pulpit in this case twitter to put pressure on ally and de facto opec leader saudi arabia to get ready to pump more oil to keep both oil and gas prices from spiraling out of control much of the blame for higher prices actually belong to argument makes perfect sense
if trump would ease back on both his heated rhetoric toward iran though that case could be made over much of trump s dealings with china the eu canada and others and if trump would revisit his decision on sanctions on iran then oil markets would benefit
why
a softer line on iran would reduce the worry or even fear that a loss of some million barrels per day bpd of iranian crude would roil oil markets so much that the saudis would have to pump an unprecedented amount of oil perhaps as much as million bpd eating up all of its spare saudi s have never pumped more than around million bpd of oil a level reached in june and has for more than years kept at least million bpd of spare capacity for oil market management
related a storm is brewing for oil exportsunder such a scenario global oil markets would be dangerously exposed to any oil increases as well as geopolitical developments that always take aim at global oil markets
a recent bloomberg article articulated the problem well
it said that the simple truth is that there isn t enough spare capacity in the world to replace the complete loss of iranian saudi arabia can boost output to million bpd immediately the report added citing a interview with saudi crown price mohammed bin salman
it can also go to million in six to nine months bloomberg added but the prince has said nothing since then to suggest the figures have s thinking called into questionhowever all of this seems to be lost on trump
with november elections approaching and decisive house and senate seats in contention much of the second half of the president s term could be jeopardized if higher gas prices amid higher oil prices eat into voters pocket books and they take their frustration out at the polls
trump s only plan appears to put undue perhaps geopolitically damaging pressure on the saudis to make up for anticipated lost barrels when the saudis likely can t do it alone
related opec won t take additional action as oil prices riseit s also apparent that trump has taken an emboldened stance with the saudis since its riyadh who was instrumental in trump s decision to iranian oil production problems persisting in libya and in venezuela and with those problems likely to carry into the fall election season and beyond trump is playing a dangerous game and could find his back against the wall
voter angst in november would also spill over into the upcoming presidential election season
consequently the campaign slogan of presidential incumbents the president may fall on deaf weeks ago hootan yazhari head of frontier markets equity research at bank of america merrill lynch said trump s push to disrupt iranian oil production could cause oil prices to hit per barrel by the end of the second quarter of next year
others have forecasted even higher prices breaching the plus per barrel price only option alluded to at the top of this piece would be for trump to with america s european allies over iranian nuclear development and other concerns
this would tone down oil market worries and perhaps even open the door for with both the eu and in time tehran in essence cooler heads and diplomacy would prevail
however there is little chance that the president would or even could at this point change his mind without losing immense political face
something thus far he has been unwilling to tim daiss for top reads from
