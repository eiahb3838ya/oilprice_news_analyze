colombia’s oil industry faces 3 big problems
colombia s beleaguered oil patch remains under considerable pressure
aside from falling investment and a lack of proven reserves that has led to fears that it only can support another five years of production at current rates it continues to experience considerable disruptions and failure of peace talks and ending of a bilateral ceasefire with the last remaining marxist insurgent group the national liberation army eln has seen the guerillas recommence attacks on domestic energy industry includes the recent bombing of the caño limón pipeline which connects the caño limón oil field operated by ecopetrol and produces around barrels daily to the caribbean port of coveñas
in early february another bomb destroyed a stretch of the pipeline extending an already stoppage caused by earlier attacks
this has taken barrels daily of transportation capacity offline impacting colombia s already declining make matters worse the eln instituted a national armed halt in the territory it controlled slated to end on february
this was aimed at disrupting local commerce including the transportation of crude in that territory as means of exerting economic pressure on the santos government to recommence peace latest news for colombia s oil industry couldn t get any worse
violent protests have erupted at ecopetrol s castilla chichimene and oilfields in colombia s central meta province
the protests stem from a labor dispute between locals and ecopetrol the state s largest oil producer
the violence including threats against the safety of ecopetrol workers at those locations forced it to shutter production at those fields
related clean oil that only costs s difficult to determine when ecopetrol will be able to open the spigots and recommence pumping at those oilfields
it will have a sharp impact on its performance because the three oilfields combined are responsible for around barrels of daily oil production which amounts roughly percent of ecopetrol s total daily output
this doesn t bode well for the company especially as it battles a range of preexisting issues like dwindling reserves and oil output
this latest development along with oil s recent weakness caused ecopetrol s stock to fall by percent over the last combined with the ongoing outage of the caño limón pipeline and further threats by the eln to attack the crucial transandino pipeline which can pump up to barrels of crude daily between the southern putumayo basin and the pacific port of tumaco it s a dark omen for colombia s energy andean nation s oil output has been in decline since resulting in a sharp impact on its economy causing export earnings national income and the value of the colombian peso to tesla s powerpack real hope or mostly hype these issues also act as a deterrent to desperately needed foreign investment in colombia s energy patch
according to data from the nation s central bank by the end of foreign investment in colombia s oil industry fell to less than half of what it was in both and latest unrest certainly doesn t bode well for colombia s oil industry and could very well depending on how long production is shuttered further impact bogota s budget
a fiscal deficit of percent of gdp was forecast for the year and due to the importance of oil exports for generating national income and economic growth it could cause that deficit to coupled with a more sober outlook for crude the ongoing unrest in colombia s crucially important oil industry doesn t bode well for either ecopetrol s or the economy s performance in smith for top reads from
