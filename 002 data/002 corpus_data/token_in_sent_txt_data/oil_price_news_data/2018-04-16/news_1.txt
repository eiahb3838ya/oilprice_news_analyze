is trump’s offshore drilling plan a disaster?
the trump administration has had to rein in expectations for offshore oil drilling with an aggressive sales pitch and boastful rhetoric mostly being met with tepid interest from the oil march oil and gas companies only bought about percent of the acreage on offer in the largest offshore auction in history
the disappointing figures came after a lot of hype from the trump administration including discounted royalty secretary of interior ryan zinke struck a much more contrite tone in his testimony to congress last week after proposing an aggressive offshore drilling plan in january which was met with pushback from most coastal states
states matter local voices matter you matter and governors matter zinke told a house panel
i think i know exactly where everyone sits on both coasts
we are shaping our plan
this is not a rule
this is a opposition has come from both republican and democratic coastal states up and down both the atlantic and pacific coasts
the political headwinds combined with the high cost of producing in completely new areas would likely keep investment on the sidelines something that zinke admitted in his what s also happening there is no doubt that drilling offshore is more risky than onshore
investments are moving onshore to the permian shale drilling region that is less risky he said
unlike the gulf coast there is no subsea infrastructure zinke said

if the gulf of mexico is struggling where political support is strong infrastructure is well developed and reserves are well understood the prospect of moving forward on atlantic and pacific drilling seems out of reach even before one considers the tough political a new report says that the results of the march offshore auction are not as bad as everyone thinks
the relatively poor results were more a factor of the administration s rhetoric as opposed to anything surprising or negative about the actual results tommy beaudreau a former director of the bureau of ocean energy management boem in the interior department wrote in a report for columbia university s center on global energy fact the results were relatively healthy and reflect trends in offshore development strategies and market conditions that have taken hold over the past several years and likely will the recovery of oil prices is still rather recent and several years of low prices have taken a heavy toll on capital expenditures beaudreau offshore gulf of mexico has to compete with other oil assets around the world including onshore shale which has shorter lead times a significant advantage for oil companies particularly when the market forecast remains highly uncertain
this competition did not exist a decade ago when the gulf of mexico accounted for a significantly higher proportion of domestic oil and gas production beaudreau crude build stalls oil price rallyhe also argues that the industry has dramatically lowered production costs and moving forward will remain much more disciplined
that means that instead of buying up speculative acreage in auctions as in the past oil companies are increasingly focused on a strategic approach to leasing decisions which has led to a more modest results in auctions
companies are focusing on lease blocks that are in prospective areas fit well with their portfolio and are close to existing accessible infrastructure and facilities beaudreau says
the bottom line he argues is that the march auction was not a disappointment but a reflection of this new era in which companies pursue a more methodical the oil majors have spent heavily in auctions in mexico and brazil in recent months a sign that they are more interested in offshore basins that have remained off limits to them up until only trump administration has been trying to assert energy dominance and an aggressive offshore plan was part of that
even if interest from the industry is not a total disaster offshore spending and exploration probably won t go back to nick cunningham of top reads from
