norway to create thousands of jobs in arctic oil
when statoil struck oil in what is now the johan castberg field back in nobody expected that just three years later oil prices would plummet and the norwegian energy major would have to apply a lot of ingenuity to make the project viable
now it is not just viable but some see it as the project that will spark a revival of the norwegian oilfield services johan castberg field consists of three deposits with combined reserves estimated at between and million barrels of crude
this makes it one of the biggest recent discoveries in norway s continental shelf and the local industry certainly need all of these and then some
after all field depletion in the north sea is a very real problem and arctic drilling is a challenging and costly endeavor which as statoil saw last year does not always result in a this context the johan castberg project has become something of a hallmark in the recovery of the local oil industry
thousands of jobs were lost during the downturn and now new ones are being created as statoil prepares for the start of production at johan castberg slated for most recent news around these preparations led to celebrations at the aker solutions factory in sandnessjøen a northern norwegian town
the oilfield services provider will deliver the ten subsea templates for the field which according to one industry insider makes it one of the biggest oilfield service contracts in the region in giæver managing director of regional oilfield supplier network petro arctic is upbeat about the future of the industry thanks to johan castberg and several more discoveries that are being actively developed
in fact he is so upbeat that he expects the turnover of goods and services in the industry to jump to us billion billion kroner per year beginning in from us million billion kroner in the peak years before the price slump
related new sanctions on russia could lift oil prices furtherone reason for this optimism may be the simple fact that norway as green as it is can not afford to shut down its oil industry
it still is and will continue to be a major budget revenue source despite the country s commitment to is that the last price collapse taught oil majors how to be this frugality is paying off by turning previously expensive projects into affordable viable ones
again johan castberg is a case in point
initially the cost of the project was calculated at us billion billion kroner
now it has been cut by more than half to us billion billion kroner with production costs per barrel as low as us
the project has the backing of the norwegian government which last week presented it to parliament for review before the oil ministry gives it the ministry also believes johan castberg and the other oil and gas discoveries made recently in the norwegian shelf and the barents sea could revive the local oilfield service industry which is why it is throwing its support behind these projects
but nobody is putting all their eggs in one basket russia wants to drop dollar for oil paymentsstatoil while still very active on its home turf is betting big on brazil and mexico for its future production
aker solutions and its peers are eyeing expansion into wind energy as the diversification path that makes the most sense for companies with decades of expertise in offshore johan with several other oil and gas indeed hail in a new era of growth for norway s oil producers and suppliers
that field alone is estimated to have a productive life of three decades which will create a lot of positive spinoff effects for suppliers according to giæver and other local industry insiders
but chances are that aker kværner and the rest of them will continue expanding into sectors at the same time just in irina slav for top reads from
