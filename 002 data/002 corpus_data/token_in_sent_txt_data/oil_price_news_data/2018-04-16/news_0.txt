can the world’s most profitable company justify its valuation?
one of the best kept secrets in oil over the past decades has been how much money saudi oil giant aramco has been making from extracting what s probably the oil in the has never reported such figures and as an entirely enterprise it was not obliged to do so
but now that it aims to list percent of its likely in than in as initially will have to report numbers at the very least in its ipo speculation as to when and where saudi aramco will list ranges from the saudi stock market only in to we re ready for an ipo we re just waiting for the right time bloomberg news has the generated us billion in net income for the first half of absolute shows that aramco is not only the world s most profitable oil company it means that saudi aramco is more profitable that the most profitable listed company in the world apple
aramco s us net profit is also higher than the combined net incomes for of all of big oil s shell chevron total and stunning net income in the saudi oil giant s figures may be impressive but the other numbers that bloomberg has reviewed in aramco s accounts are not so obvious question from this scoop is do those numbers justify a us valuation of figure that saudi officials have been targeting since they announced that they wanted to list the oil giant to reap billions in proceeds to pay for economic diversification from the kingdom s oil saudi officials worried about oil s futurethe short answer is no according to various analysts and institutional investors who have been asked to crunch the aramco to bloomberg calculations aramco s production costs imply a rough estimate that it extracts oil at a cost of less and us a barrel compared to shell and exxon s cost of us for terms of cash flows however aramco s figures are not so impressive
its cash from operations was us billion in compared to shell s us billion and exxon s us billion
yet shell for example pumped just a quarter of the oil volumes that aramco extracted in to its oil production aramco generates lower cash from operations than shell and exxon do
the reason aramco pays a income tax plus a royalty to the state of saudi arabia that varies according to the price of higher the oil prices the more marginal royalty rate aramco pays to the kingdom
this means that even with higher oil prices future investors in aramco will see limited gains because the royalties that the company would have to pay to saudi arabia would rise as the price of oil to the financial information that bloomberg news has seen saudi arabia has linked the royalty regime for aramco to oil prices replacing a fixed royalty without publicly announcing the change
as of january saudi arabia imposes a marginal rate of percent of revenue for oil prices up to a barrel percent for the price of oil between and and percent for oil prices above
since january last year aramco s royalties have been calculated based on a progressive scheme say the financials that bloomberg has seen
another change in the royalty payment scheme is that aramco is now paying royalties on crude oil and condensate production on the value of crude oil and refined products sold as exports as it was previously worded
the difference is around million of all to can aramco achieve the us valuation related the trump twitter effect on oil priceseven at this astonishing net income according to analysts who say that while the cost of production is an important metric for the valuation the price of oil is the most important investors crunched the numbers for bloomberg and are saying that aramco could get a valuation of between us trillion and us half of what the saudis are hoping for
this valuation is based on oil prices at us in the long term and valuation models that are similar to those applied to other major financial times ran the numbers in a model and asked experts about aramco s valuation
most answers were close to us trillion
the ft calculated the reported financials and found that at oil prices of around us aramco gets a valuation of us trillion
with oil prices at us the saudi giant would achieve a valuation of us trillion
a us valuation can only be achieved if oil prices were to rise to around us a barrel by according to the ft on the aramco figures robin mills at energy consultancy qamar energy told the ft if they are still hung up on the number it s never going to according to aswath damodaran a finance professor at new york university aramco is a source of saudi wealth and the kingdom wants to have its cake and eat it too
it wants to go public and be treated as a normal entity but they also need to use it as a cash there is no way it gets to
it was a fantasy from the beginning damodaran told the by tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
