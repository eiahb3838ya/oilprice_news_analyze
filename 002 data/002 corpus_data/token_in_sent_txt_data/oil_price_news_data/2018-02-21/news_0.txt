the u.s. oil industry sets its sights on asia
just a decade ago few could have imagined that the would be producing more than million bpd of crude but with the explosion of shale production that is exactly where we what can only be seen as a complete in policy and mindset the flow of imported oil is poised to become the flow of exports
this about turn must of course be borne out by logistics and practicalities first as aging infrastructure that was designed primarily with movement in mind requires a significant overhaul if it to meet this reverse consequences of this shift are already being revealed as trading volumes in wti futures surged ahead of those of brent and trading of oil future contracts has doubled in the last decade
what formerly acted more as an indicator of inventories is now being seen as a benchmark for traders and shippers and the spread between wti and brent is this rate of production increase the is set to overtake russian crude output in late making it the foremost global supplier
at per barrel drilling companies can afford to develop their equipment and techniques while at the same time keeping shareholders how long it can last is open to debate but with the stagnant output of north sea oil seemingly unable to meet the rising demand in developing markets such as asia the boom of oil production shows no sign of than being crippled by opec attempt to flood the market north american shale seems to have taken this challenge in stride and even become stronger faster and more efficient as a result
couple this with crude s more dynamic pricing system and it is hard to see why wti futures are overtaking futures like brent and dubai

when oil prices are high it can ramp up production thereby both saving money on expensive imports and capitalizing on high exports
should prices fall again it can take advantage of low import costs and scale back production until it reaches a favorable this means for opec is that its power is a mere shadow of what it was in the
its influence of the global oil trade is evaporating and its reliance on oil wealth is something that is looking untenable at best
the rising dominance of russia and the coupled with the global shift away from oil consumption means that it must diversify its income if it wants to survive
the aramco ipo may just be the very beginning of that crude exports hit a major milestonewhat we re seeing is more than just the reversal from energy dependence to energy dominance but a complete transformation of the global elastic production diverse crude quality vast storage ability integrated trading capabilities and concentrated refining capacity that has come about from the boom in shale oil output all amount to energy independence but crucially they mean that the is able to dictate the market on its own luxury was barely conceivable a decade ago but it s looking more and more like the shape of things to gary norman for top reads from
