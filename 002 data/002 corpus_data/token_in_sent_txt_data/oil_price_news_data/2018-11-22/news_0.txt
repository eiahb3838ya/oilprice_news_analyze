can oil solve washington’s syria dilemma?
in the past seven years syrian cities have been reduced to rubble thousands have lost their lives but the main objective of the and its allies to remove bashar has failed
as of november government forces loyal to assad have recaptured significant swaths of land from rebels
two areas have escaped their grasp idlib protected by turkey and eastern syria protected by the ankara needs to cooperate with russia and iran to obstruct the creation of an autonomous kurdish region and prevent new flows of refugees towards its territory
washington s primary goal however is to maintain a foothold in syria in order to contain is confronted by two challenges in achieving its goal a working economy in eastern syria and a rebellious turkey
ankara strongly opposes the kurdish ypg which is the backbone of the sdf forces that have established control over the area
eastern syria however contains the resource by which washington can overcome both challenges two sides of syriasyria is usually divided into roughly two parts western syria and eastern syria
the majority of the population before the conflict lived in the urban areas of western syria which includes the cities of damascus hama homs and aleppo
these areas had the highest contribution to national economic output
despite the destruction it is safe to assume that these areas will become the epicenter of economic activity syria on the contrary is the less productive part of the country due to its relative underdevelopment
before the war when the last meaningful inquiries were made the region had an illiteracy rate of percent compared to the national average of percent
of the workforce in eastern syria percent worked in agriculture compared to a national average of its low economic output the eastern region is actually the breadbasket of syria and contains the majority of the nation s energy resources
before the war the country produced barrels of oil per day of which were exported
the challenge currently is not production but transportation
before the war a kilometers long pipeline transported the oil to a transport terminal on the mediterranean sea in western syria
this pipeline is currently out of order as the west is controlled by forces loyal to syria revivedwashington s efforts to oppose and depose president assad have failed
attempts to unite rebel groups and provide them with training and weapons didn t have the desired results
the sdf in eastern syria of which the kurdish ypg is the backbone has been the exception
secretary of state mike pompeo declared that the syrian kurds have been great partners and added washington would make sure that the kurds have a seat at the table autonomous kurdish region bordering turkey would be the scenario come true for ankara
the turks have declared on multiple occasions that the kurdish issue is a red line
unfortunately for ankara washington does seem willing to change its course concerning its support for the kurds
the has tried to appease turkey by putting bounties on several pkk leaders
ankara however interpreted these steps as an effort to separate the ypg from the pkk
related the oil industry is facing a capex conundrum despite the intractable position of both the and turkey washington could bring the parties together on basis of mutual interests and economic dependency
eastern syria contains percent of the country s oil resources
the kurds have already struck a minor deal with the syrian government under the mediation of moscow to share a third of the barrels per day produced at rmailan oilfield
energy however could also moderate ankara s position the kurdish issue by providing an incentive to as glueturkey and eastern syria are complementary to each other in terms of energy production and consumption
the kurdish controlled areas could potentially produce large quantities of oil while turkey already imports percent of its energy from abroad
ankara opposition concerning washington involvement is not by definition aimed towards the kurds but the ypg dominant has already established working relations with another autonomous kurdish region in iraq
despite ankara s strong opposition towards the independence referendum of iraqi kurdistan in october the pipeline has been restarted
if washington is able to mitigate the ypg s role and convince turkey of the benefits in working with the remaining syrian kurds both parties could benefit greatly from vanand meliksetian for top reads from
