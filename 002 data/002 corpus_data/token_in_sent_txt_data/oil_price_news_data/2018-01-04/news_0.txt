opec should thank venezuela for falling production
opec s crude oil production remained largely unchanged from november in december but that was mostly thanks to a decline in venezuela s production as well as further cuts in saudi arabia a bloomberg survey of data analyst opinions and company information has suggested
at million barrels daily opec s production is a hair below the ceiling it imposed on its members with the production cut agreement
but opec should hold off on patting itself on the back
while saudi arabia and iran cut their production in december by bpd each libya s fell for reasons outside the control of the national oil corporation a pipeline blast temporarily took off between and bpd off daily production
according to the survey data libya s average daily production decline for the whole month was bpd
meanwhile nigeria raised its oil production by the same amount effectively offsetting the libyan supply disruption
all in all one can t fail to notice that the compliance rate opec is boasting with the pact in december was the result of accidents and an inexorable production slide in venezuela rather than conscious effort
now since the start of the year brent crude has crept up nearer to us thanks to the iran protests and wti has hit us a barrel
this will certainly make it harder for those that can raise their production to resist doing just that and since pipeline blasts can not be least by the official december decline may shrink at some point in the coming months however fast venezuela s production falls
there is already talk about prices being too high to continue rising some analysts argue that after hedge funds and money managers accumulated a number of bullish bets on the commodity the only thing they can do going forward is to start selling
if that happens opec would need to rein in the cheaters to keep the cut deal going
