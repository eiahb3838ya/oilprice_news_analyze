is venezuela’s downward spiral opec’s achilles heel or saving grace?
opec and us shale have been duking it out in the oil markets for a few years since the days of oil
opec led by saudi arabia took up a campaign to flood the market with oil to drown out the rising stars of the us shale world
but that oil came at a price and the glut sunk prices to uber lows that hurt every oil producer in the more than was no exception to feeling hurt
its state oil company shall we say the hugo chavez administration s personal piggy already reeling from corruption and was busy fighting with foreign oil firms who were operating in country and subsequently booted out
the country had no money to invest in its cash cow to keep it running
president nicolas maduro who took office when oil producers were for the most part fat dumb and along with pdvsa a country that was in crisis with some even saying back then that it was on the verge of an economic breakdown with moody s tallying a public sector deficit of percent of its gdp
and when oil prices started to tank venezuela s dire economic situation became ago venezuela was an instrumental member of opec with chavez reestablishing venezuela s seat at the opec table
today venezuela is still an active member with maduro serving as one of the loudest cheerleaders of the original opec production cut deal solidified in late after his whirlwind tour designed to save its country from ruin with the increased oil revenues that would likely come from such a deal
maduro visited all the who s who in the opec oil world including iran qatar and opec kingpin saudi that time maduro claimed to have a formula that would stabilize oil prices for ten years
that concept now squarely in the rearview mirror is clearly viewed as both tragic and laughable given the recent price swings
related could make or break opecdespite maduro s plan being clearly dead in the water opec was still able to pull off a production cut deal that managed to lift prices for a time
in fact the plan was so successful that combined with a few geopolitical events between iran and the united states and china and the united states and libya nigeria and venezuela s unintentional production outages opec conspired to lift production
some would say this is in part attributed to maduro s full circle the market is once again facing falling oil prices along with another planned production cut from the cartel
venezuela who did manage to benefit somewhat from the original production cut deal in is producing fewer and fewer barrels of oil on a monthly basis ending with a daily production level that is near lows for the latin american country
and no one is holding onto hope that venezuela s oil production will is no one but venezuela s production sure to continue its downward spiral opec is bound to catch a break on the production cuts
opec agreed to cut bpd this time around and venezuela will likely eat away at some of that bpd without even trying
this takes some of the heat off other opec members who may find it difficult to curb production yet the surface this indicates that venezuela s opec membership is paying off for opec
it has been instrumental in getting opec members on board to reduce production and it is cutting its own barrels produced in great numbers even if not on purpose allowing other members such as iraq to overproduce without hurting opec s overall compliance
related falling rig count supports crude priceshowever opec is a cartel and that cartel s purpose is to coordinate and unify the petroleum policies of its member countries and ensure the stabilization of oil markets in order to secure an efficient economic and regular supply of petroleum to consumers a steady income to producers and a fair return on capital for those investing in the petroleum unfortunately for opec venezuela s economic and political situation is so bleak that it has almost no control over its own oil production
it can not ramp up production
it can not export more
it has failed to secure this regular supply of petroleum to its consumers as opec s mission statement calls for
in fact venezuela has begged borrowed and keep pdvsa afloat and still it of opec s claim to fame is that it has the clout to move oil prices up or down by moving production up or venezuela can no longer participate in that activity
opec s clout has waned thanks to the rise of us shale but also due to what some are seeing as opec s production capacity
surely venezuela s production capacity is maxed and surely that max will continue to decrease
as venezuela s production capacity dwindles so does opec s which is likely why russia and a few extras have been brought into the opec the short term venezuela helps opec to meet some immediate production cut goals
in the long term however venezuela will likely remain a drain on opec s overall capacity as it is unable to contribute in any meaningful way to the cartel that relies on production manipulation to swing julianne geiger for top reads from
