new data suggests shocking shale slowdown
shale executives often boast of low breakeven prices reassuring investors of their ability to operate at a high level even when oil prices fall
but new data suggests that the industry slowed dramatically in the fourth quarter of in response to the plunge in oil survey from the federal reserve bank of dallas finds that shale activity slammed on the brakes in the fourth quarter
the business activity survey s broadest measure of conditions facing eleventh district energy positive but barely so plunging from in the third quarter to in the fourth the dallas fed reported on january reading is only slightly positive zero would mean that business activity from texas energy firms was flat compared to the prior quarter
a negative reading would mean a contraction in deceleration was true for multiple segments within oil and gas
for instance the oil production index fell from in the third quarter to in the fourth
the natural gas production index to in the fourth quarter down from in the prior even as production held up drilling activity indicated a sharper slowdown was underway
the index for utilization of equipment by oilfield services firms dropped sharply in the fourth quarter down from points in the third quarter to just in the fourth falling to the point where there was almost no growth at all
related could make or break opecmeanwhile employment has also taken a hit
the employment index fell from to suggesting a moderating in both employment and work hours growth in the fourth quarter the dallas fed wrote
labor conditions in oilfield services were particularly hit data lends weight to comments made by top oilfield service firms from several months ago
schlumberger and halliburton warned in the third quarter of last year that shale companies were slowing drilling activity
pipeline constraints well productivity problems and budget exhaustion was leading to weaker drilling conditions
the comments were notable at the time and received press coverage but oil prices were still high and still rising and so was shale output
the crash in oil prices and the worsening slowdown in the shale patch puts those comments in new does all of this mean
if oil producers are not hiring service firms and deploying equipment that suggests they are rather price sensitive
the fall in oil prices forced cutbacks in drilling activity
oilfield service firms in particular are bearing the brunt of the slowdown
executives from oilfield service firms told the dallas fed that their operating margins declined in the quarter
related opec oil exports to the fall to lowin fact roughly percent of the oil and gas executives that responded to the dallas fed s survey said that the recent drop in oil prices caused them to lower expectations for capital spending in
a further percent said that it was still too early to make a decision on capex changes
only percent of oil executives who responded to the fed survey said that the oil price downturn would not affect their spending oil rig count climbed for much of but began to level off in the third quarter
the rig count which stood at in the last week of december has barely budged since late october when prices began to downturn is still in its early days
it takes several months before the rig count really begins to respond to major price movements
the same is true for a string of other data production levels inventories as well as capex other words some early data points already suggest that the shale industry could struggle if wti remains below per barrel
but the longer wti stays low the more likely we will see a broader nick cunningham of top reads from
