new technology could wipe out trillions in fossil fuel investment
we are living in a carbon bubble with trillions of dollars held in oil gas and coal assets that would be wiped out before long as technological advancements in all sorts of industries quickly undermine fossil fuel is the gist of a recent study led by the university of cambridge which involved macroeconomic simulations with the researchers concluding we are on the brink of a much worse financial crisis than the one from as between and trillion worth of fossil fuel investments turn into stranded assets
for context the authors note that the crisis was sparked by losses to the tune of us fast pace of technological progress in renewable energy and elsewhere that is producing higher levels of energy efficiency is the driver of the crisis
to avoid it the study authors say the world needs to deflate the bubble carefully before it bursts
otherwise we might see a global crisis compared to which the great recession was a researchers ran repeated simulations with different scenarios as researchers tend to do in such studies and concluded that the worst case would be continued fossil fuel production in the context of falling demand which is actually a conclusion one doesn t need macroeconomic simulations to if opec nations maintain production levels as prices drop they will crowd out the market says one of the authors hector pollitt from cambridge econometrics and eenrg
opec nations will be the only ones able to produce fossil fuels at the low costs required and exporters such as the us and canada will be unable to related oil sinks deeper on opec concernsbut this will be just the start
as demand declines by other fossil sell so cheap that even large producers will not be able to enjoy their revenues
social and political tumult could ensue as jobs are lost and disgruntlement grows
ironically the push for more and stricter climate change policies will only aggravate the situation unless it is accompanied by parallel action in fossil fuels namely winding down investments in their sounds decidedly questionable when you compare it with warnings from say opec s mohammed barkindo that oil prices could soar unless more money is spent on new production but the researchers are not the only ones sounding the energy efficiency recent report from norwegian quality assurance and risk management provider has forecast that global energy demand could plateau by thanks to energy efficiency improvements
the firm goes as far as to say that the world economy s energy intensity will decline faster than the economy grows over the next years

at an average energy efficiency improvement rate of percent annually until it is the single most important factor that could bring the world closer to meeting the paris agreement efficiency and the technologies behind it don t get as much headlines as solar wind or especially evs
but it may turn out that it is as the norwegian firm calls it the unsung hero of the energy irina slav for top reads from
