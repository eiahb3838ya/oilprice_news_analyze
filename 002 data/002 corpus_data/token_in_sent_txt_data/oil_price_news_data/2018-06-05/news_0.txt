will saudi arabia listen to u.s. demands for more oil?
the trump administration has sent a request to saudi arabia for it and the rest of opec to boost oil production by million barrels per day according to a bloomberg wasn t the first time that the has asked saudi arabia to ratchet up supply in an effort to relieve high prices
former president george bush pressed the saudis to increase output in early just ahead of the historic run up in prices
his pleas which persisted in the first half of the year as oil prices continued to rise were rebuffed by saudi arabia
a few months later the financial crisis helped resolve the problem of expensive the obama administration asked saudi arabia to increase production after an international coalition slapped sanctions on iran which cut down iranian oil exports by about the finds itself in a similar situation as it did six years ago
oil prices climbed to highs and sanctions on iran threaten to push prices even higher
however what is a bit more unusual from the government s request this time around is the trump administration apparently has a specific figure in mind the saudis and opec should increase output by the said according to bloomberg
to be sure reuters reported that the did not request a specific way in a departure from the past opec seems to be more amenable to american appeals for higher output
the cartel s said a few weeks ago that the tweet from president trump in april influenced their calculations and they felt they needed to prevent prices from rising too much
related oil sinks deeper on opec concernsand comments from secretary of treasury steven mnuchin in may suggested that the and saudi arabia had at least discussed the possibility in the context of the pulling out of the iran nuclear deal
mnuchin said that various conversations with various parties about different parties that would be willing to increase oil supply to offset the losses of iranian supply
a bit of a word salad but mnuchin was likely telegraphing the willingness of saudi arabia to increase officials huddled in kuwait just a few days ago trying to hash out a strategy ahead of the june meeting
opec officials were about what was discussed but they promised to ensure stable oil supplies are made available in a timely manner to meet growing demand and offset declines in some parts of the the boilerplate statement could be interpreted as a willingness to increase output this year ahead of schedule but it was likely intentional that the statement was left so all the jockeying behind closed doors a series of public comments from the saudi and russian energy ministers suggest that the two largest producers in the group will likely agree to increase production in two weeks time although the specifics still need to be hammered out
russia is aiming for a larger increase in supply perhaps around
saudi arabia wants something much more are a few reasons why opec might be more sensitive to the wishes of the government than they were in the past
for one the trump administration has been very explicit about its support for riyadh and hasn t expressed any concern about human rights or the war in yemen or other issues that might irk the saudi government
trump is also much more aggressive towards iran than the obama administration something that goes down well with the saudi the saudi government led by crown prince mohammed bin salman is more bellicose than it used to be
mbs as he is known has waged an aggressive foreign policy and is itching for a fight with iran
the saudis need the on board with that campaign so placating washington with cheaper gasoline prices is a small price to pay
related new iraqi lawmakers want out of opec dealhowever unlike the past the biggest difference arguably comes from the oil market itself
a decade ago when president bush asked for help saudi arabia saw little downside in snubbing him
the was hopelessly addicted to oil and had no way to avoid paying high prices
while that addiction has changed only marginally in the intervening years the difference between then and now is that saudi arabia has to worry about losing market share to shale saudi shale narrative is a bit overblown in the media but the fact of the matter is that opec runs the risk of sparking too much supply if it lets prices rise too far
in years past oil would stimulate new investment but those projects would take years to come online
short lead times for shale however have sped up the price cycles so the risk is that high prices will lead to a wave of new supply which crash prices again in short order
indeed shale has already grown rapidly over the past few short saudi arabia looks ready to increase production but it has a variety of reasons why it could agree to do so
it isn t just that riyadh is complying with a specific demand from the nick cunningham of top reads from
