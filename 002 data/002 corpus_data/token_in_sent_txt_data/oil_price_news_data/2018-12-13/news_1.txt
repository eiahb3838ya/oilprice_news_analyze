iea: opec+ has put “a floor under prices”
the agreement succeeded in at least putting a floor under prices according to a new report from the international energy agency
the global supply surplus is not resolved and would likely reemerge if let up on its production cuts
but the agreement was welcomed by the iea in its december oil market report where the agency noted that oil prices had been extremely volatile in the few months prior to the meeting in vienna last recently prices have been volatile in early october brent crude oil prices reached on concerns that the market could tighten as iranian sanctions were implemented the iea wrote
then days later they fell back to as producers more than met the challenge of replacing iranian and other barrels
such volatility is not in the interests of producers or the agency kept its demand figures steady but noted that the trend is negative
demand will grow by although there are signs that the pace is slackening in some countries as the impact of higher prices the oil market is now dominated by the big three the iea said referring to russia saudi arabia and the united states
combined those three countries produce percent of global supply
while the us was not present in vienna nobody could ignore its growing influence the iea wrote

for much of this year the imported an average of according to the iea a figure that is vastly lower than the more than it imported regularly a decade ago
in the last week of november the had a net export tally of bpd
as production grows inexorably so will net imports decline and rising us exports will provide competition in many markets including to some of the countries meeting in vienna last week the iea into there is a floor beneath prices with the agreement but the path to the upside will be a bumpy one
the iea sees supply growing by more than total global demand next year which clearly lays out the challenge facing
if producers mainly the are set to grow output by in but demand is only set to rise by will strictly comply with the production cuts perhaps for the full year in order to head off a growing the pace of shale growth continues to confound analysts
this year shale output is expected to exceed initial estimates by some
that doesn t meant shale producers will continue to over perform pipeline bottlenecks could slow growth lower prices could curtail drilling activity and financial pressure could also take a it is a reminder that at a minimum shale output is hard to predict
new pipelines are expected come online at the end of next year which will clear the way for more drilling completions and shipments to refineries and to the gulf coast for producers probably won t be as fortunate
alberta has already put in place mandatory production curbs
the coalition party to the deal have signed on to output limits
many of the world s conventional producers are suffering from declines
brazil is expected to be one of the few countries outside the that could add supply in and not by huge amounts
thus the us alone is likely to be responsible for the increase in supply which probably makes the iea s forecasted rise of million barrels per day too optimistic commerzbank wrote
related saudi arabia can outwait the khashoggi crisisstill unexpected outages could tighten up the market with little notice
just days ago libya saw roughly bpd go offline much of which came from the country s massive el sharara field because militias were threatening the national oil s operations
local communities have been protesting the lack of benefits they see from the oil fields
regardless of the outcome of this particular dispute el sharara will remain particularly vulnerable to disruption hamish kinnear mena analyst at verisk maplecroft said in a statement
whereas most of libya s major producing fields are located in the oil crescent el sharara is situated in the remote and contested south there are also plenty of other variables that inject a ton of uncertainty into the oil market as we head into
will be no less challenging than last year for the oil market
the global economy is losing momentum which could have a dampening effect on demand trends commerzbank said in a new report
because the us government is unlikely to extend the granted exemptions from its iran sanctions in early may iranian oil exports will presumably decrease trade wars supply growth economic uncertainty sanctions political upheaval and unexpected outages the iea may hope for less volatility but does not appear to be shaping up that nick cunningham of top reads from
