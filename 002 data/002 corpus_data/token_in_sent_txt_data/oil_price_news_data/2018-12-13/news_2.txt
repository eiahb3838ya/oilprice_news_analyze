no, the u.s. is not a net exporter of crude oil
last week bloomberg created quite a stir with this story the just became a net oil exporter for the first time in years
i have seen a number of stories that praised the significance of this development but others laughed it off as misleading or is some truth to both viewpoints
yes the headline is somewhat misleading and requires some context
but there continues to be a trend in the direction of energy independence for the
so today i want to break down the numbers so readers can understand the truth about petroleum production consumption and crude production has surgedthe bloomberg story is based on data from the energy information administration eia
each week the eia publishes detailed statistics on oil production consumption exports and inventories in a report called the weekly petroleum status report
so let s go straight to the the week ending the eia reported that the produced million barrels per day bpd of crude oil
that represents a million bpd increase from the number
this number is generally accepted even by those who believe the bloomberg headline was down in the report the category of products supplied is listed at million bpd
this is approximate crude oil consumption for the week
thus as some skeptics of the story suggested the bottom line is that the is burning more than million bpd while producing less than million bpd
thus the conclusion for some was that the isn t close to being energy supplybut there is important context between these numbers
first the million bpd is a fairly accurate representation of consumption but there is a large production number that isn t included in the crude oil production numbers
related will china turn its back on lng there is a line item called other supply which consists primarily of natural gas liquids ngls and fuel ethanol
this category represents a significant input to refiners in addition to the million bpd of production and the million bpd of net crude oil imports
other supply represented million bpd of production and it mostly ends up as feedstock for refiners or petrochemical production
note that this category also includes refinery processing gain of million bpd which results from refiners making products that are of a lower density than crude oil domestic production of crude oil plus other supply is equal to million bpd which is still about million bpd less than the exportshowever these numbers don t account for exports
during that particular week the imported million bpd of crude oil and exported million bpd
thus net crude oil imports were million product exports are a different story
during that week the imported million bpd of finished products while exporting million bpd which includes some ethanol and ngls
net exports of finished products were million bpd
the became a net exporter of just finished products in also exports crude oil
president obama repealed the old crude oil export ban in and crude oil exports have soared since
as an aside the reason the simultaneously imports and exports crude is that some of what we produce isn t a good match for our domestic refineries
so we export some domestic crude and import crude that is a better match for our checkso here s a summary of the important inputs to the balance that resulted in the bloomberg claim crude oil production million other supply ngls ethanol processing gain million crude oil imports million crude oil exports million finished product imports million finished product exports million petroleum consumption million bpd related analysts output cuts to balance oil markets in the bloomberg headline results from a net crude oil import number of million bpd and a net finished product export number of million bpd
so indeed when you consider crude oil and finished products for the week ending the was a net exporter of million bpd of crude plus finished products
for perspective this average over the previous four weeks was million bpd of net imports remarkable achievement but false headlinesignificantly this is the first time this category of weekly crude plus finished products became an export number since the eia began reporting this information in
this is a far cry from when that weekly number hit an of million bpd
as far as i can tell bloomberg is correct that this hasn t happened in the past that s not what the headline claimed
the headline said the is still a net importer of oil to the tune of million total production of oil and other supply that is fed into refineries is million bpd while consumption is million bpd
that still puts consumption at nearly million bpd more than we produce
it s actually a little worse than that because not all ngls end up as refinery feedstock the bottom line is that we aren t net exporters of crude oil and we aren t energy independent
but the has trended in that direction for over a decade
regardless of whether it remains that way this is undoubtedly a remarkable achievement
i know a lot of people including myself would have scoffed at such a prediction in robert rapiermore top reads from
