the u.s. oil industryâ€™s dirty little secret
the oil industry engaged in a secret public relations campaign to undermine fuel economy standards according to a new investigation from the new york of the main actors was the largest oil refiner in the country marathon petroleum
marathon along with others ran a stealth campaign to roll back car emissions standards the nyt reported
the campaign argued that the no longer needs fuel economy standards because it is now such a massive producer of with oil scarcity no longer a concern americans should be given a choice in vehicles that best fit their needs a draft letter that was sent to members of congress said
the trump administration took up the talking points in its official justification for the proposed watering down of fuel economy of the debate about the corporate average fuel economy standards cafe which were set to rise to over miles per gallon by focused on the position of the auto industry
but california still has the authority to set its own fuel economy standards something that the trump administration is now contesting as it seeks to freeze federal standards at mpg beginning in auto industry has been the dog that caught the car it initially pressed the trump administration to weaken the fuel economy standards but realized that the aggressive rollback would leave the industry with a patchwork of state levels regulations led by stricter standards in california
different standards for different states would require automakers to produce different cars for different markets a reality that would be more problematic than the more stringent nationwide while media coverage focused on this between major automakers environmentalists and the trump administration it appears that oil refiners were waging a stealth pr campaign to convince the public that the standards are no longer needed
marathon teamed up with the american legislative exchange council alec according to the nyt investigation where they pushed facebook ads and lobbying at the state and federal level
they trumpeted a resolution calling the fuel efficiency standards a relic of a disproven narrative of resource related saudi arabia can outwait the khashoggi crisisthe motivation is obvious more efficient vehicles including hybrids and increasingly electric vehicles will cut into gasoline sales from refiners
while automakers have to worry about complying with state level fuel standards refiners simply want to sell more fuel
marathon s ceo gary heminger told investors in early december on a conference call that the rollback in fuel economy standards would mean the refining industry would sell an additional to bpd of freezing the auto standards as proposed would lead to increased oil demand by between and bpd according to the rhodium experts argue that the gutting of auto emissions standards would likely result in the largest impact on greenhouse gas emissions out of any other initiative pursued by the trump administration including the rolling back of methane limits gutting the clean power plan or opening up vast new acreage for more oil and gas cleaning up of the electricity sector more renewable energy and a switch is happening on its own due to pricing pressure from cheaper and cleaner sources of energy
transportation is a tougher nut to crack and stricter federal standards have been critical to improving fuel oil refiners were never going to sit on the sidelines and let federal regulations cut into their sales

this sentiment has permeated much of the political establishment as well and helps explain the sudden indifference to the selling off of the strategic petroleum reserve spr after decades of rigorous safeguarding of the stockpile
washington seems to think that producing more oil insulates the country from supply it doesn t matter how much oil the produces motorists are always going to be vulnerable to price swings so long as they burn a lot of fuel
even recent data demonstrates this to be true
gasoline demand actually declined in the third quarter compared to a year earlier a sharp drop off due to the run up in global crude oil prices
the fact that the was breaking oil production records did very little to insulate drivers from the price spike
it s true that shale has contributed to lower global prices but removing the most effective policy from the toolbox is really nick cunningham of top reads from
