the biggest challenge for u.s. oil exports
as saudi arabia and russia grapple with both the geopolitics and economics of continuing or stopping their one and a half year long oil production cut reached between opec and members in early oil exports are slowly making their way into companies will export some million barrels per day bpd of oil next month and over half of that million bpd will find their way to asian markets reuters said citing a key executive with an oil exporter
this follows a record million bpd of oil that the exported just two weeks oil exports into asia come as the price differential between global oil benchmark brent crude and benchmark west texas intermediate widens
that price differential is currently around per barrel offering arbitrage opportunities for producers and huge savings for asian refiners who buy crude the discount between the price of brent crude and wti produced in the permian basin widened to nearly per barrel in april marking the the largest monthly spread in almost four years
in april brent futures sold for an average per barrel while permian crude sold for just a long as price differentials remain oil exports will continue to chip away at both saudi and russian market share in asia the world s largest oil consuming region led by china japan india and south korea
china surpassed the in annual gross crude oil imports in importing million bpd compared with million bpd for the according to a report by the energy information administration eia problem for oil exporters however is that many asian refineries are configured to process heavier crude blends and have to use lighter sweeter oil to blend with other crude grades
for refiners that can process lighter crude the price differential is a boon and ensures that oil exports will continue to grab asian market share
yet the also exports other grades like mars and southern green canyon which are medium sour grades as well as bryan mound and more complicated problem for oil exporters are bottle necks and lack of pipeline infrastructure to move crude to market
this is particularly acute in the permian basin which has a lack of pipeline takeaway capacity to transport oil to houston or corpus christi where it can be loaded on tankers for export
it s a story of producers being the victim of their own success
related why oil exports are only heading highera report earlier this month by the federal reserve bank of dallas said that lack of pipeline capacity hasn t yet stymied production but that could change later this year or by the middle of next year if more pipelines are not variable in the equation is just how much oil is the geared to export
moving from a current average of just over million bpd to top off at what some analysts claim could be a maximum of capacity of to million bpd will take more some maneuvering
the problem with trying to determine the exact export figure is that most terminal operators and companies don t disclose capacity while the doe doesn t keep track of the demand intersects oilpipeline problems and capacity questions notwithstanding china is poised to import more crude as chinese president xi jinping offers a trade war olive branch of peace to president trump s insistence that beijing do more to trim the massive trade deficit between the two economic power to meet the growing consumption needs of the chinese people and the need for economic development china will significantly increase purchases of united states goods and services the white house said last week after a round of talks between american and chinese trade both sides agreed on meaningful increases in united states agriculture and energy exports
the united states will send a team to china to work out the details and will continue to engage at high levels on these issues and to seek to resolve their economic and trade concerns in a proactive manner the statement added
related are we about to see another correction in oil prices the largest buyer of crude going forward will be sinopec the largest oil refiner in the world which operated million bpd of total oil processing capacity in and has considerable market share in asia for selling refined petroleum products
moreover unipec china s oil trader is engaged in a war with saudi aramco over the price increases of its arab light crude which lends more support for crude exports into fact unipec has purchased around million barrels of crude oil for loading in june marking the biggest volume ever to be lifted in a month by the company a report in hellenic shipping news said this weekend citing industry is expected to receive the crude cargoes in while the trading arm of sinopec said it would raise its shipments from the to china by around percent to bpd in from around bpd last year the report unipec source said that the increase purchases was only due to the spread and not due to unfolding trade talks between washington and beijing
but at the end of the day it s both
the price arbitrage between oil and brent along with pressure from beijing to procure more oil will help american oil exporters make incursions into asia and china s oil market though those incursions due to current restraints on oil imports will be marginal at first and tim daiss for top reads from
