opec overcompliance has created a problem
crude oil inventories in the organization for economic and development have fallen below their average level a opec official told s p platts this week
they are now million barrels below that average the source said thanks to opec s overcompliance with the production news comes amid reports quoting russia s and saudi arabia s energy ministers as saying they are negotiating a of production ahead of the deadline
the reports began emerging after brent hit us per barrel and india s petroleum minister dharmendra pradhan called saudi arabia s khalid to reiterate his government s insistence on stable and moderate oil a phone call all it took for to make a in his statements regarding oil prices and start assuring the market that there is sufficient supply and there is no reason why brent should trade above us
probably not although india is among saudi arabia s largest clients and its demand for oil is growing at the fastest pace in the has been monitoring oecd inventories closely and not just because its target in the cuts was the oecd inventory average
there was talk a few months ago that this average may not be the best measure of global oil supply
that talk was prompted by data suggesting the inventories were not falling as fast as opec had hoped but with venezuela s production in a free fall things settled and prices took off
related norway s ev adoption starts to affect oil demandnow after it became clear that moscow and riyadh are talking about a possible increase of million bpd oil prices lost all they had gained since the beginning of the month within a week
perhaps the time has come for some urgently needed bullish oil news such as the clearing of the glut
after all before had assured india there will be enough oil there were reports about saudi officials admitting the kingdom is targeting us a barrel or higher to boost aramco s the oecd inventory target has been met us is seeming increasingly unlikely despite some figures including goldman sachs continuing to be bullish on oil
as russia s alexander novak told bloomberg on the sidelines of the petersburg economic forum no decision on increasing production has been made yet
it will be made in june when meets to discuss the matter is also reason to be bullish for the fact that according to some analysts the additional supply that opec and russia plan to bring online would barely compensate for the loss of production from both venezuela and iran
related opec has regained its grip on oil marketsany optimism however should be cautious
production continues to grow and exports are also set for a further increase june shipments are projected to hit million bpd of which million bpd will go to asian buyers
crude is cheaper than both the opec basket and the russia urals benchmark so it would be eating directly into s market share
this is cause for concern in the cartel and in russia which has already made it very clear it would be happier with oil at around us a barrel rather than us decision to keep cutting or start ramping up needs to be unanimous uae s oil minister suhail told media this week
there is hardly any chance for surprises however
so far the cartel has gone where saudi arabia has wanted it to go some more willingly than others but still together as higher prices are generally good for economies
but now the memory of oil at us is still too fresh and a lot of oil consumers enjoyed faster economic growth thanks to cheap may be unwilling to pay so much more so is once again between the rock of shale production and exports and the hard place of budget gaps and investment projects that need irina slav for top reads from
