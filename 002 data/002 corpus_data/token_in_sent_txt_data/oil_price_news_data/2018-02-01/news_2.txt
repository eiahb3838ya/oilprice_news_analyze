north americaâ€™s next big shale play
the oil price crash of not only weighed on canada s oil sands industry but it also directed more company investment into shale projects in the at the expense of more and oil sands production in the oil sands will continue to be a growth story thanks to investments made before the downturn canadian energy officials and many oil companies both and supermajors are increasingly looking to explore and drill in the two largest shale formations duvernay and montney estimated to hold billions of barrels of light tight oil and trillions of cubic feet of canada s shale oil production is around bpd according to estimates by energy consultancy wood mackenzie quoted by reuters
this is some percent of total canadian production which the national energy board neb says was nearly million bpd in
wood mackenzie expects shale oil production to rise to bpd in a of canada s oil production comes from oil sands
in canadian oil sands production is expected to have exceeded million bpd according to ihs markit
production is expected to continue to grow thanks to investments made prior to the oil price crash while future investment is to remain lower than historical levels the data and analysis provider said in a report earlier this in new oil sands production capacity has dropped by since the oil price crash from more than billion to just over billion estimated for and may fall further this year before starting to recover ihs markit says
related goldman oil to top within six months once operational oil sands facilities are largely unresponsive to the oil price with production neither ramping up nor ramping down materially said kevin birn executive director at ihs it s likely that the investment in mega oil sands projects sanctioned before the downturn has ended with the fort hills project that started pumping oil this month
now oil majors and canadian companies are looking at the vast shale deposits of the duvernay shale in central alberta and the massive montney resource play in northwest alberta and northeast british neb has estimated that the duvernay contains billion barrels of marketable light oil and field condensate and nearly trillion cubic feet tcf of marketable natural gas
the montney formation is estimated to be very large with expected volumes of billion barrels of marketable oil and tcf of marketable natural duvernay play could be compared to the eagle ford in the while montney is unique and contains several different levels at which oil and gas can be drilled mike johnson technical leader of hydrocarbon resources for the neb told reuters nia oil companies plan to invest more in canadian year several oil majors sold their oil sands assets with shell selling its interests for around billion and conocophillips divesting oil sands assets in a billion both companies continue to hold and develop their tight oil assets and both shell and conoco have acreage under development in duvernay and year investment in duvernay will be shell s shale investment second only to the permian in texas the company s spokesman cameron yost told november chevron said that it was moving into development on a portion of its lease holdings in the kaybob duvernay area of alberta following a successful appraisal program
related are canadian oil prices set to rebound encana plans to invest virtually all its anticipated capital in its core assets with around percent directed to the permian and montney
in montney encana s liquids production more than doubled from to driven by a focus on condensate rich wells and the early of some processing plants
the company expects to further grow its liquids production this increasingly we are going to see light tight oil and natural gas forming a key part of alberta s energy future alberta s energy minister margaret told canada s shale oil patch needs more exploration for drillers to understand the structures of the vast formations
it also has a formidable competitor for investment dollars south of the border with shale now in its boom
and canada will has transportation difficulties not all proposed pipelines to ease canada s takeaway capacity restrictions will see the light of day and even if they do it won t be until tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
