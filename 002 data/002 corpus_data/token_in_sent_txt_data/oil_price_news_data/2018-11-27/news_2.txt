stopping syriaâ€™s oil smuggling scheme
the civil war in syria has resulted in areas being deprived of domestic oil
before the war eastern syria produced percent of the country s oil
today syrian government forces have been forced to source oil from external actors to power the country
last week the trump administration exposed a complicated scheme involving companies and individuals in russia iran and syria working together to transport oil to the necessary areas
sanctions have now been announced concerning those accused of participating in this complicated plan to smuggle schemethis oil smuggling scheme has allegedly been in place since transporting millions of barrels of oil to syria
damascus in turn has facilitated the transfer of hundreds of millions of dollars from the islamic revolutionary guard corp s quds force to hamas and hezbollah
treasury secretary steven mnuchin declared today we are acting against a complex scheme iran and russia have used to bolster the assad regime and generate funds for iranian malign activities critical actor within this plan has been mohammad amer alchwiki and his company global vision group
the syrian national alchwiki was central to both the delivery of oil to syria and the transfer of funds via iran s quds force to hamas and hezbollah
the source of the alleged malign activities is the central bank of iran cbi which provided the order to conceal the source the cbi apparently used tadbir kish medical and pharmaceutical company to transfer money to alchwiki s global vision company
the companies both have a bank account at the mir business bank in russia which is a subsidiary of iran s bank melli
the front company is a medical organization meaning it adheres to humanitarian needs so that sanctions do not russia global vision has an agreement with promsyrioimport a subsidiary of the russian ministry of energy minergo
the russian company facilitates the purchase and shipment of iranian oil purchased from the national iranian oil company to syria
transport is extra precarious as some of the ships have been insured by european companies and allegedly have turned off their beacons since to conceal their destination

using his international connections at the cbi and mir business bank he has been an interlocutor on behalf of the syrian government
as with the oil scheme the cbi played a central role by providing the necessary iranit has been the trump administration s policy to confront iran and these sanctions are further evidence of that
the withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal was the prelude of opposing tehran in political economic and diplomatic areas
washington s success has been and diplomatically president trump s actions unified an unusual alliance of global powers including russia china france germany and the in maintaining the nuclear deal
the has also tried uniting several arab states in what has been called the arab nato
this initiative isn t yet the success it was hoped to become primarily due to the blockade of qatar by several other members
the awkward collaboration of these arab countries seems to be motivated by appeasing trump rather than confronting iran
related the real effect of iran sanction waiverson an economic level washington has had more success in confronting iran
after the signing of the nuclear deal many companies showed a willingness to invest in the country
the reimposition of sanctions however made many companies reconsider their investment plans
most notable of those companies was french energy giant total which abandoned its massive south pars lng the has granted temporary sanction waivers to eight countries to import iranian oil it is highly unlikely these will be extended
the prime reason for washington s decision was its fear of increasing the price for oil by depriving the market of million barrels of iranian oil
currently tehran is under pressure as the economy is failing and protestors are taking to the the difficulties iran is facing many analysts believe tehran will be able to ride out the storm
despite the recent drop in prices the country is aided by relatively high oil revenues and the inability of trump to form a united coalition as the obama administration managed with the previous nuclear new sanctions will not have the desired effect of crippling the syrian economy or depriving assad support of moscow and tehran
it is likely that oil shipments will continue while the itself faces increasing pressure from a confrontational turkey in eastern syria the kurdish vanand meliksetian for top reads from
