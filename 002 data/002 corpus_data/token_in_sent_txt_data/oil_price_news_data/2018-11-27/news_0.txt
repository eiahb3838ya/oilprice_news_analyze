the last thing saudi arabia wants to do at the moment is to risk upsetting trump the senior saudi oil adviser told the sudden sensitivity about how its actions are perceived by washington demonstrates the fallout of the jamal khashoggi murder
mbs has sacrificed a ton of leverage at the meeting and more importantly he has essentially given up full control over saudi oil policy for little because of khashoggi the saudis will do anything to make sure trump doesn t do anything nasty to them an opec official told the nick cunningham of top reads from
