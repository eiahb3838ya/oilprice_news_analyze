later today however opec will come out with a statement on the topic that will reveal its final position on the cuts amid a lot of internal russia and several other producers will join the talks and the amount of the be specified
al rumhy said he believed could reduce its combined output by million bpd
the agreement will be in force for six months the minister also about cuts began last month initiated by saudi arabia amid slumping oil prices
analysts projected cuts in the range of to million bpd but most acknowledged this time it might be harder for the kingdom to get everyone on board
iraq is not the only one that can t really afford the cuts iran has stated it will not discuss its production quota while under sanctions and russia has made it clear it was fine with prices where they are
yet president putin said at the meeting cooperation between russia and saudi arabia would continue which suggested russian oil companies will join the saudi arabia and russia prevail in the discussions the only issue would be the size of the cut unless iraq decides to quit the cartel altogether as barclays david cohen suggested in a chat with cnbc
if that happens whatever cuts are agreed would have about the same effect on prices as the entry into effect of sanctions against iran after market players had months to prepare for opec failed to reveal a solid agreement in vienna after hours of meetings
