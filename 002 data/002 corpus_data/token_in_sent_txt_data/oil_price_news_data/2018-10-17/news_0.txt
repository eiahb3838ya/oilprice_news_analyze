u.s-saudi clash could spell disaster for opec
the khashoggi case is far from over as current harsh statements coming from washington are only is there a long line of
senators calling for an investigation of the matter some have even openly called for the removal of saudi crown prince mohammed bin
senior lindsay graham one of the staunchest supporters of us president trump and saudi arabia has broken ranks as he asked on us to remove mbs from his moves from washington are not only endangering the very strong ties between washington and riyadh but also endanger the overall middle east and internal stability of opec
the oil cartel led by saudi arabia is looking at a very stormy ride the next couple of months while the is heading for another showdown in the arab khashoggi case has become a possible watershed in international relations
statements made by us graham already supported by other officials show that the position of saudi arabia as a strategic ally of washington in the middle east and mbs in particular is under severe public threat made by graham news channel to put strong sanctions on saudi arabia if the crown prince is not being removed is a first
not even in the case of iran russia s involvement in the ukraine or the ongoing disaster in syria an open call was made for regime change
if threats were made by senators it always was directly linked to a strong opposition movement in that country or being directed at an government or time the threat has been directed at a until weeks ago strongly supported ally with strong ties to washington policymakers the financial world and the defense industry
president trump s current statements on saudi arabia the moves made by secretary of state pompeo and others now seem to be very hollow
the washington administration looks like a lame duck as its supporters in congress and the ny financial world are calling for a strong and reaction
such as reactions however could have a more negative impact for the and western interests than currently is being discussed
related are oil exports really unstoppable the khashoggi crisis comes at a pivotal moment in the energy markets and geopolitical arena
while the west tries to revamp its influence in the middle east they are being confronted by the of russian power and influence of china
at the same time washington is set to implement sanctions on iran possibly shaking global energy markets to its foundations
strong support is needed from the arab states
washington s approach is very diffuse as it also threatens legal action against opec
the no oil producing and exporting cartels act or nopec legislation is threatening lawsuits against the oil cartel
according to reuters opec has already stated to its members not to discuss oil price hikes as it could result in legal action or another washington riyadh clash
we solemnly believe that market stability and not prices is the common objective of our actions uae energy minister suhail who holds the rotating opec presidency this year wrote in the letter seen by reuters
in the same letter mazroui reiterated that to refrain from any reference to prices in their commentary about our collective efforts or oil market condition pressure in washington to put the law up for voting has caused bad blood in several opec capitals
trump s repeated calls on opec to increase production to lower prices also has not been taken lightly
the khashoggi case could increase support in washington to back the nopec bill
saudi arabia is extremely worried about the bill
there is a major fear nopec could turn into another jasta one of the sources familiar with aramco ipo preparations said referring to the justice against sponsors of terrorism act which allows victims of the attacks to sue riyadh
at present trillion in saudi investments in the could be at stake
if the nopec bill is signed into law the move would revoke the sovereign immunity from legal action which oil producers including opec members currently addition to interests in the region europe is being confronted by growing russian and chinese involvement in the arab world threatening in theory its economic and military interests too
washington s strong hand policies on saudi arabia could lead to a weakening of overall western interests in the coming weeks
a call for the removal of mbs in saudi arabia is for sure going to be seen in the other arab capitals as new western colonialist betrayal of its friends in the uae bahrain and egypt
western influence already has diminished after their support for change in libya and egypt
the current western moves are seen by most in this possible shift in geopolitical alliances is imminent
the pressure from the west will entice or even force saudi arabia and its allies to reassess their future
as indicated before saudi arabia has already opened up its doors to russia
these ties were forged by a slump in oil prices and the need to strengthen the hold of the kingdom and opec on the oil market
the success of the cooperation has become clear but also has led to a discussion on security and investments
the historical orientation of the arab world especially saudi arabia but also the uae and egypt on the west has changed already dramatically but will now take a giant leap asia has taken over already as immense investments made by oil companies such as aramco and adnoc in china india and other asian emerging markets show
russia has taken its share too
moscow s real strength however next to markets is it willingness to back up its friends in time of need
a military alliance is on the table looking at the current developments
the security of the arab regimes is at stake so choices will have to be made
a cooperation between riyadh and moscow based on opec oil issues and security developments is to be expected in the next months
the first signs will be seen in riyadh next week at the
related goldman sachs this is the next big risk for oilfor the global oil markets this will be a
if arab regimes need to get security and political support from moscow and beijing western energy interests are at stake
a possible law as proposed in the will only add to this
the year could become the year of a new geopolitical oil market reality
full cooperation between opec leader saudi arabia supported by the uae and russia will present washington and brussels with a new global energy market situation which they won t be able to mitigate s strive to change the oil market which already was a fata morgana could be ended before the first green sprout is showing
with the current antagonistic position taken by washington s elite a clash is imminent with saudi arabia and others
the main opec leaders will keep to their current production strategy not willing to open up their taps
a possible stronger move to keep volumes lower than expected is also in the offing as saudi arabia is not forced to produce at current levels at all
a strong reaction is to be expected addition to a smiling putin who is going to be the main beneficiary of the current crisis the mullahs in tehran will be enjoying their free lunch too
without support of saudi arabia and others sanctions on iran could be an empty threat
trump can forget full support from saudi as long as the latter is under pressure
iran could be one of the beneficiaries of the current clash
the regional power struggle between riyadh and tehran could be put aside when looking at a pure opec strategy
consolidation of the current production agreement without saudi arabia and russia filling the void of iran s oil volumes could be an outcome to be cyril widdershoven for top reads from
