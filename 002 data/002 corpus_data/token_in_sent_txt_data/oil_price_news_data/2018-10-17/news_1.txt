oil price rally revives offshore oil sector
the offshore drilling segment of the energy industry was among the hardest hit by the downturn
many went under and those that did survive were on their last legs when prices began to climb back up
now things are looking up and the sector could see a full recovery by recalls in a recent story how offshore drilling rigs fetched around us per day during the worst of the downturn from as much as half a million dollars before
now according to offshore drilling giant transocean it is raking in us per day for its specialized vessels deployed in the north should come as no surprise just like oilfield service providers offshore drillers first suffered more than producers and are now reaping the benefits of a recovering industry
but the future of offshore drillers was always less certain than that of the oilfield service sector as a whole
the reason offshore drilling is as a rule costlier than onshore exploration and production especially in deep waters
in a environment e ps are naturally opting for cheaper resources
yet this is by no means the whole s still a future for offshore oil and it s not too bleak in fact in parts of the world it s rather bright with these parts including brazil parts of south america and perhaps somewhat surprisingly given its legacy status the north sea
supermajors are in a rush to expand their footprint in these hot spots and they will need rigs to explore them and pump the crude and gas
the drilling sector is gearing up for higher the second quarter of last year offshore drillers retired the most rigs over a period bloomberg reported at the time citing an energy advisory firm
now ihs markit has forecast that in global drilling rig demand will hit on average versus its estimate for this year which is for rigs

back in crude was riding the demand growth wave trading at over a barrel and everyone was in a rush to
the new generation of offshore rigs were designed for depths of as much as feet but they weren t designed for idling
now many of these rigs have been idled for two or more years and besides demand is shifting to smaller more flexible and ultimately cheaper vessels as producers seek to extend the life of already producing fields and lower the costs of new wonder then that offshore drillers are consolidating
the biggest deal so far has been transocean s acquisition of ocean rig for us billion in cash and stock
this was the second substantial deal for transocean since the start of the year
earlier it bought norwegian songa offshore for us transocean is not the only buyer
ensco also made a couple of large deals in it took over atwood oceanics for us billion and earlier this month it inked a deal with smaller sector player rowan cos worth us billion
the deal includes rowan s interest in a joint venture with saudi for drilling rigs is unquestionably set for a rise
big oil is actively working on its reserves replacement and energy independents are eager for a piece of the offshore pie while it lasts
the recent consolidation could continue allowing the survivors to better position themselves for this rising demand
it would also help them to take better advantage of the automation trends in the industry the robots are coming to offshore irina slav for top reads from
