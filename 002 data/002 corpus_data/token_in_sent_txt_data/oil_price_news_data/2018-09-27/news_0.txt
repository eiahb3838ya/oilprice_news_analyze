why a u.s. spr release would not matter
the decision by to essentially let brent crude rise above per barrel a high was met with outrage by president trump
at the un general assembly he denounced opec and opec nations are as usual ripping off the rest of the world and i don t like it
nobody should like it
we defend many of these nations for nothing and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices
not good trump said
we want them to stop raising prices we want them to start lowering prices and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on
we are not going to put up with it these horrible prices much it is unclear what he meant by that last sentence
he would seem to either being threatening some retaliation against opec members for not increasing production or perhaps he was threatening to do something to try to lower oil prices
there is little the government can do to promote even faster domestic production as production decisions are made at the company only thing the trump administration can do is to release oil from the strategic petroleum reserve spr
the rebuff by to trump led to some analysts to expect a release from the spr particularly since elections are quickly approaching and voters are experiencing retail gasoline prices close to highs
average retail gasoline prices nationwide rose to per gallon for the week ending on september according to the if opec does not wish to jeopardise its independence it will hardly be able to respond to trump s latest remarks by raising output commerzbank wrote in a note
so trump s only real option is to release strategic reserves in order to drive prices down ahead of the congressional related traders turn bullish ahead of iran sanctions there s a strong possibility of another strategic reserve release said antoine halff head of the global oil market program at columbia university s center on global energy policy according to bloomberg
it s a wild card that justifies close attention for the next few bloomberg also reported that industry executives openly speculated about when trump might tap the reserve at the annual asia pacific petroleum conference appec in singapore this secretary of energy rick perry dismissed these rumors
he told reporters that any sale would have a fairly minor and impact and he trusted that the oil market would be fine as opec and russia would fill any potential s right on the first point even if the moved to sell more oil from the spr it would only have a limited and temporary impact
citi s ed morse said it could lower prices by a few dollars per barrel
but oil traders would know that any sale is temporary
mike muller an executive at vitol group told bloomberg that the market may even interpret a release as a bullish sign since it would reduce the supply cushion that major producers could call upon for future any event the use of the spr as a political tool may not be all that effective because it s probably too late
there is a lag between changes in global crude oil prices and the price of gasoline at the pump so even if an spr release were to occur tomorrow motorists likely wouldn t see the effect until after the elections
related opec vows to boost spare oil capacitystill the political cost of unloading oil from the spr is not what it once was
it used to be the case that the government was extremely protective over the spr and very cautious about dipping into it
however the shale revolution has created the semblance or illusion of abundance and the congress has already begun legislating sales of the spr for budgetary reasons
top policymakers have all but given up on the massive spr as a tool for energy policy and energy security
the congress has already legislated sales of oil from the spr spread out over the next decade
the upcoming sale of million barrels in october and november is part of other words there is no longer a political cost for the trump administration if it were to decide to take an aggressive route and sell large volumes of oil from the spr above what is already now sec
perry insists that is not in the cards
and because iranian supply will continue to fall in the weeks and months ahead oil could be heading higher
as a result the talk is now brent reaching a barrel in the future said tamas varga analyst at brokerage pvm oil associates according to the wall street nick cunningham of top reads from
