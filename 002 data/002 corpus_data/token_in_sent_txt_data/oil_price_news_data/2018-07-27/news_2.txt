what’s keeping investors away from energy stocks?
the prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids are much higher than they were a year ago and the outlook for natural gas prices has improved
however dozens of profitable upstream oil gas companies are still trading in the lower half of their range
the money managers on wall street either don t understand how profitable upstream companies are at these commodity prices or they believe oil prices have peaked and are going to let me say that most investors let s call them the wall street gang really don t understand the upstream oil gas
these are the companies that drill complete and operate oil gas wells which provide the primary energy sources that give us such a high standard of living in the united states
most investors don t realize how profitable the business will be if crude oil prices just stay over not to mention the wealth that will be created if oil bounces back to over july i made a presentation in houston to a room full of energy sector investors were i gave my thoughts on a recent raymond james associates industry update and their oil price target
raymond james energy team based in houston is now forecasting that west texas intermediate wti will average during the half of and the beginning of
their official price forecast for oil prices are for wti and for brent after
unofficially most of the analysts based in houston that i talk to think oil prices are going a lot opinions are that the price of oil never stays at the right price for long
oil price cycles always on the downside and the upside so there is a good chance we see wti prices spike over within the next twelve months
if you agree with me then you should have a lot of high quality oil gas company stocks in your prices should be set by fundamentals so let s check that out first
then i will go over some of the fears that seem to be keeping the wall street money managers on the sidelines
related oil jobs under threat from dronesdemand for oil is increasing about million barrels per day each year and production is declining by approximately million barrels per day
this paints a bullish outlook for the energy sector companies that work in the upstream midstream and oilfield services sectors
click to enlarge looking only at the fundamentals should be a very good year for the energy sector what are investors afraid of
why hasn t more money rotated into the energy sector fear and greed drive the marketsthere are four primary fears that are keeping money managers on the sidelines on top of these are company specific fears that are beyond the scope of this s cover each of these primary fears one at a supply growth will overwhelm the oil marketit is true that oil production is growing in the united states but the rate of growth will slow after
without a significant increase in the active drilling rig count there is no way the still a net importer of more than million barrels of oil per day can meet global demand for oil on its own
outside of the all of the other countries net to declining oil supply and this assumes only modest declines in venezuela and iran in opec only saudi arabia has significant untapped production capacity and it does not appear that they can offset the declines in venezuela libya angola and iran following the implementation of sanctions in can not keep growing oil production at the current pace or even close to it unless there is a significant rise in the active rig count
during a july presentation in houston raymond james estimated that the active onshore drilling rig count in the would need to increase by more than next year in order for the to duplicate the production growth in
i don t think it is possible because the onshore drilling companies don t have a lot more high end drilling rigs sitting around and they won t build them without active rig count must grow each year because the nation s annual depletion rate is increasing as we layer on more and more high decline rate horizontal wells
today the high end rigs don t exist to do the believe that will be the peak year of oil production growth in the well productivity gains over per year from to slowed to in and are expected to decline to in and in
reasons for the slowdown are worry the coalition will flood the oil market again
it is clearly not in the cartel s or russia s best interest to lower oil prices again
opec s additional production capacity nets to zero through click to enlarge saudi arabia the kingdom s claim that they have remaining production capacity of million barrels per day is a myth
it would take an aggressive drilling program and lots of new infrastructure to push their production up to million barrels per day
raymond james rj base model for to global oil supply demand is that saudi arabia s actual production will average million barrels per day thru
saudi s recent increases in exports are the result of draining storage tanks and can not be sustained for is a failed state rj s base assumption is that venezuela s production goes from mmbopd in to mmbopd in
i ve had some smart people tell me that venezuela s production could go to zero if there is a military coup and the chances of that happening goes up each day
pdvsa the government s oil company recently announced that two of their four oil upgraders had to be shut down for maintenance
this will take several barrels per day off of the is another wildcard
rjs base assumption is that libyan production holds at mmbopd
my view of libya is that it is a failed state much like venezuela
it is a country run by lawless gangs
as we have seen several times over the years since moammar kaddafi was killed in a significant amount of libyan oil production can be taken off the market without notice
anyone counting on a steady flow of oil from libya has not been paying much attention to the news from north rj s base assumption is that president trump s sanctions against iran will take bopd off the market
obviously this is a wildcard and the actual amount could be a lot higher
my opinion is that trump is serious about iran and the sanctions will take more than bopd off the market in early
direct military conflict between the and iran will quickly push oil over a is not a threat to oversupply the oil market that many on wall street believe it is
in november they drained the tanks to artificially jack up production before the vienna agreement
russian growth will be bopd per summary can not increase production even if they wanted to do so and it is certainly not in their best interest to do anything that will lower oil lack of production declinesinvestors often forget that outside of the and opec the rest of the world produces more than of global oil supply
most of the countries don t produce enough oil to meet their own demand and like the they are heavily dependent on imported oil and refined of investment in large exploration development projects since early has pushed completion dates of many supply growth projects many years down the line
some projects have been cancelled
outside of small growth in brazil and russia the rest of the world s oil production will be on decline through and there is not much chance of anything changing this outlook
also even when there was over four years of oil there were no major oil discoveries added
outside of the shale revolution the rest of the world reached peak oil in just as king hubbert predicted that it weakening global demand for oilthe concept of peak demand for oil is total hogwash ginned up by the same people that think tesla will take over the automobile market
annual demand for oil has actually accelerated this decade
demand for coal has declined but demand for oil natural gas and ngls goes up
related tight oil markets are ignoring supply risk demand for oil got off to a strong start this year with global growth at over million barrels per day yoy helped by cold weather in the northern hemisphere
recent data however points to a slowdown with rising prices a factor
in growth slowed to yoy
in growth will average million falling to million in the second half of the year
in the comparison with a strong will see growth of close to million accelerating to million in
we expect growth of million in world oil demand in both and unchanged from last month oil market international energy agency iea has a long history of understating oil demand growth
from to iea understated demand growth each year and had to revise up their demand forecasts upwards to actuals by an average of bopd
my forecast of actual demand growth being million barrels per day in and may end up being too conservative
with a strong global economy demand for oil will probably increase closer to mmbopd in world runs on oil and nothing on the horizon is going to change that click to enlarge conclusion global demand for oil exceeds supply by more than a million barrels per day as you read this article
and oecd crude oil inventories will be declining to dangerous levels within six months and the price of west texas intermediate wti is expected to average more than for at least the next three quarter
chances are that conditions in venezuela and the impact of sanctions against iran will take another million barrels of oil supply off the prediction oil price cycles always overshoot the right price and we will see oil in early is a great time to add more energy to your investment dan steffensmore top reads from
