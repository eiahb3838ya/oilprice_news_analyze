how u.s. shale flipped the script in global oil markets
in the previous article asia s insatiable oil demand i covered global and regional oil consumption numbers according to the bp statistical review of world recap global oil consumption rose to a new record high in and has now increased in of the past years
over the past decade global oil consumption has increased by million barrels per day bpd
the primary driver behind the past decade s demand jump is the asia pacific region which was the source of percent of the world s demand growth over that i want to discuss the source of the world s new oil production in recent decade ago in the summer of the price of west texas intermediate wti crude was racing toward a barrel
over the previous three years the world had only increased oil production by million bpd and it essentially all came from analysts including me were extremely concerned about the future hold opec would maintain over the world s oil supplies
it appeared that there would an enormous transfer of wealth from those countries dependent upon oil imports like the united states to opec countries
in many cases these countries have interests that are hostile to those of the so this was very much an issue of national the future played out differently than it seemed it would in the summer of
unbeknownst to most people oil producers were experimenting with a marriage between two established oil drilling technologies horizontal drilling and hydraulic success of this marriage would unlock oil in tight oil and shale oil deposits that had previously been too expensive to recover and would result in one of the greatest oil booms the world had ever seen
in fact the fracking revolution caused oil production to turn upward in and then rise over the next seven years at the fastest rate in it is still true that opec produced percent of the world s oil in the majority of new oil production since has come from the supply growth the million bpd of new oil production since the supplied million bpd percent
the world s two other major countries saudi arabia and russia saw their production increase by million bpd and million bpd respectively since overall increased its production by million bpd since primarily as a result of production growth in saudi arabia iraq and iran
but opec s gains were limited by production declines in venezuela libya and nigeria
there were also regional production declines in europe asia africa and south and central america
related oil prices slip as rig count inches higheralso notable is that canada and mexico are major oil producers although mexico s production has been declining
overall north america supplied million bpd of the world s oil in percent
this was ahead of every other region of the world except for the middle east which produced million bpd or percent of the world s to the bp statistical review the now leads both saudi arabia and russia in crude oil production
this is in part because bp s definition of oil includes natural gas liquids ngls which grew by about two million bpd in the as natural gas production boomed
without the ngls the would probably have been behind saudi arabia but probably not russia in total oil is hard to overstate the consequences of the fracking revolution because the oil production surge broke opec s stranglehold on global oil prices
but tight oil production will inevitably slow and once again begin to decline
the key questions are how soon this will happen and whether a return to oil and in turn opec s stranglehold awaits that robert rapiermore top reads from
