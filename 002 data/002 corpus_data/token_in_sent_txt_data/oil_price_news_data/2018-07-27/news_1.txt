profitability is finally within reach for u.s. shale
the shale industry is on the verge of becoming the first higher prices and operational improvements are putting the us shale sector on track to achieve positive free cash flow in for the first time ever the international energy agency iea wrote in a recent report on energy years drilling in the shale patch was like running on a treadmill
the precipitous decline in production from shale the average shale well produces about percent of its oil in the first two years of operation meant that companies had to keep drilling new wells just to keep production flat
the cash used from one well was injected back into the ground to produce from a new shareholders forgave the lack of profits in the hopes that continuous growth would one day lead to juicy returns
the model convinced wall street for a while and money poured into the sector
oil prices in the period between and reassured both oil drillers and their financial that investment quadrupled and production from shale grew by eightfold from million barrels per day to which represented the fastest growth in oil production in a single country since the development of saudi arabia s oilfields in the iea analysts alessandro blasi and yoko nobuoka wrote in an all of that production still didn t produce profits
the industry amassed billion in negative cash flow in the period
that bill had to be paid through higher debt equity issuance and asset sales
click to enlarge the market downturn forced a bunch of companies operating on the edge out of business
nearly shale companies filed for bankruptcy in and downturn forced a rethink and after years of and financing the numbers started to improve
total investment in shale fell by percent between and but notably production didn t see a corresponding meltdown more of a correction
production began to rise again as drillers learned to do more with the most important waterway in the oil worldas oil prices stabilized and edged back up investment began flooding back rising by percent in
still profits remained elusive
asset sales once again became the main source of financing operations the iea production skyrocketed and drillers began throwing rigs back into operation
but several years on from the beginning of the downturn investors demanded a change in strategy with an emphasis on cash flow returns dividends share buybacks and capital discipline
shareholders pressed drillers to abandon the growth model and sought changes to executive compensation to downgrade the rewards for production spike in oil prices this year is a huge gift to the industry
with breakeven prices on shale wells much lower the surge in prices could push companies into profitable territory
since its inception the industry has been characterised by negative free cash flow as expectations of rising production and cost improvements led to continuous overspending in the sector the iea said
over the last few months the industry as a whole has seen a notable improvement in financial conditions though the picture varies markedly by company and the overall health of the industry remains the conditions are lining up in a favorable way for the shale industry
production is rising prices are up and so far cost inflation has not eaten away too much at the efficiency gains
also the industry is much more consolidated than it was in the past which brings economies of scale
improvements in drilling technology and the spread of digitalization is also yielding benefits
w e estimate that the shale sector as a whole is on track to achieve for the first time in its history positive free cash flow in related is this the next coal megaproject there are risks to this forecast
the pipeline constraints in the permian will force a slowdown in production over the next year
more painfully companies that have not locked up hedges for their output or have not secured available space on the region s pipelines could suffer from steep discounts often in excess of per barrel for their crude
other bottlenecks for natural gas takeaway capacity as well as for wastewater could also drag on permian iea also said there are clear signs of overheating in the permian which is stretching available labor materials and equipment
there is uncertainty about whether further productivity advancements can offset these inflationary obviously there is the risk of a slump in crude oil prices or more broadly an economic downturn that drags down the entire some of those problems only hit specific companies
the conditions for the entire industry by and large are better than at any point in shale recent history
for now the shale industry seems poised to finally post positive cash nick cunningham of top reads from
