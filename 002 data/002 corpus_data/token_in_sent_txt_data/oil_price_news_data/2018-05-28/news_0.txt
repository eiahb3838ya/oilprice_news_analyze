why u.s. oil exports are only heading higher
oil prices are falling but american crude is suffering even worse than its international price differential between wti and brent continues to widen briefly hitting per barrel on monday the largest discount in about three years
click to enlarge discounts of this magnitude are pretty rare particularly after the began exporting crude oil several years ago
there is a aspect to these price differentials
if wti falls significantly lower than brent then american crude oil becomes highly attractive to foreign buyers
refiners around the world move to purchase as many cargoes as possible removing the surplus from the while at the same time loosening demand on brent cargoes
the result is that there is pressure on the two benchmarks to converge once saw this play out last year after the devastation from hurricane harvey which decimated refining capacity in the and led to a buildup in crude oil supplies
the discount which jumped from just a few dollars per barrel widened to as high as per barrel although only briefly
exports surged because of the marked down price and by early the discount the discount has spiked once again although the situation could be a bit different than before
this time around the discount isn t merely a manifestation of surging shale production at a time when opec is keeping the rest of the market tight although that is certainly a major factor
but adding to those forces is a pipeline bottleneck in the permian which is leading to a higher volume of supply trapped in west permian basin alone has already added about bpd in fresh supply so far this year but the drilling frenzy is running hard up against a midstream wall
total production could hit as high as million barrels per day in june according to the eia adding bpd
however the problem is that the region only has about of pipeline rail and local refining capacity combined according to genscape
related opec has a global inflation problemthat means that the permian pipeline system is essentially maxed out
there is now a rush of demand for trucking oil from west texas to the gulf coast a bizarre side effect of the bottlenecks that have cropped up
moving oil by truck is costly so permian drillers that have not already secured pipeline capacity are being forced to discount their product in order to secure isn t just permian bottlenecks
falling production in venezuela and the prospect of outages in iran have tightened the market elsewhere keeping brent higher than wti
it s a function of oversupply and opec policy alexander blackman an executive at standard delta told the wsj last course a discount relative to brent suggests that everyone is going to want to buy crude oil on the cheap which means that exports could spike in the coming
oil exports already hit a new record at for the week ending on may before dipping a bit in the most recent week
but the trend is clearly up last year exports bounced around between and hovering close to the upper end of that range in the second half of the year
for most of weekly oil exports have been hovering around the could average around in june one prominent oil executive told reuters
the wider the discount between wti and brent the more oil will find its way to asia despite the long at per barrel the largest in three years there will be tremendous pressure working to push more barrels out from ports to buyers around the world
that is as long as shale drillers are able to find a way to get their oil from west texas to the nick cunningham of top reads from
