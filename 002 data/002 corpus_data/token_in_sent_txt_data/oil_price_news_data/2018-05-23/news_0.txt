ev revolution could wipe out $21 trillion in oil revenue
hardly a day goes by without a research company releasing yet another report forecasting the future of electric vehicles and all related industries oil included
some of these are skeptical but most predict a bright future for electric cars
the latest is no exception a company aurora energy research has projected that the adoption of electric cars could wipe out as much as us trillion in revenues for the oil gas and coal industry by oil aurora energy research predicts that revenues could fall from us trillion in to us trillion in on the back of fast ev adoption combined with major improvements in energy efficiencies
meanwhile oil prices could plummet to as little as us a is what could happen under a burnout scenario developed by the research firm that envisages fast growth in ev adoption and equally fast growth in electricity demand on the back of digital tech use driven by the expansion of the internet of this scenario that might as well be called doomsday as far as it concerns the oil industry aurora research sees the number of evs on the roads in at million
for context another research from saw the total number of cars on the road in that year at billion so evs would be a pretty solid portion of the a result of the advent of evs crude oil demand will peak long before in the
by oil prices will have fallen to us
coal will be doing even worse with a ton selling for just us thanks to the increased use of power generation capacity replacing coal power news for oil and coal under this scenario is certainly bad
not so for gas gas will be the big winner under the burnout scenario of aurora energy research with revenues there rising twofold by with both supply and prices rising as gas takes territory freed by coal and oil
related opec could relax production cutsall in all the research does not really tell us anything new except some numbers that sound impressive if you forget that a burnout scenario is not necessarily the most likely one
there have been many upbeat reports on evs but the revolution they have touted as happening has actually shaped up to be more of an evolution with adoption not as fast as many of these forecasts it is true that ev sales are increasing thanks to falling costs mainly in batteries
this year total electric car sales are seen by bloomberg new energy finance at million which may not be a whole lot but it is up considerably from the several hundred thousand evs sold four years ago
if this exponential growth continues we might just see some of the optimistic forecasts materialize although aurora energy research s prediction of evs making up a quarter of the global car fleet might be a bit of a oil industry no doubt reads all these forecasts
it s no coincidence that shell and bp are expanding into ev charging and battery technology
even if the forecasts are too upbeat it pays to be prepared for a greener future that according to aurora research will come not so much as a result of official policies as of the advance of digital tech and what the firm calls consumer engagement with irina slav for top reads from
