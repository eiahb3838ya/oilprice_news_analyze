the energy information administration reported a huge crude oil inventory build for the week to november of million barrels arresting an improvement in oil prices that started yesterday after a sharp drop earlier this growing concern about a weakening in global oil demand and rising production from opec and outside it notably in the united states the eia also reported a decline in gasoline inventories and another one of million barrels in distillate fuel million barrels daily gasoline production last week was considerably higher than the million bpd booked a week earlier
distillate fuel production averaged million bpd virtually unchanged on a week processed million barrels daily last week the eia said another flat figure on a weekly is coming and demand for crude and fuels would normally weaken pressuring prices
in this sense the eia latest weekly report out from normal seasonal demand patterns
yet its effect on prices is likely to be excessive amid heightened volatility resulting from two new reports with a pessimistic outlook for global demand from the international energy agency and iea and opec expect slower demand growth than they did earlier this year mostly on the back of slower global economic growth
yet there is also worry about oversupply resulting once again from the relentless increase in crude oil production which two weeks ago hit million barrels daily and will likely continued higher last week as well as drillers added more the time of writing brent crude traded at us a barrel up modestly from yesterday s close after earlier this week plunging close to us a barrel under the double blow of rising supplies and a call from president trump to opec to refrain from production cuts
