the world's most important oil region
middle eastern oil production is expected to grow by million bpd by according to latest rystad energy analysis
the boost in conventional oil output from the middle east is primarily driven by supply additions from iraq with million bpd growth and an additional million bpd mainly coming from the neutral zone the uae and iran in the medium from conventional fields outside the middle east peaked in and is expected to continue falling with current estimates putting output at a million barrel decline from current levels

the growth will primarily be driven by the giant southern fields rumaila west and west
over the past months the country has seen the sanctioning of expansion projects at majnoon the third phase of halfaya development and the second phase of garraf
these fields could add another bpd over the next seven years
an additional bpd could be added through project approvals
these developments could include full field development at faihaa and further expansion of nasiriyah and the official of financial sanctions by the united states rystad energy expects annual average iranian oil output to dip by bpd in a conservative case accounting for waivers granted for europe india japan and south korea for days
should sanctions be adhered to and then lifted in underinvestment in the interim would slow the eventual ramp up in production
in which case the producing fields would be able to restart at of the levels and ongoing developments primarily at south pars and would add about bpd by
furthermore the development projects with fids delayed due to the sanctions once restarted have combined potential to add over energy forecasts the uae s oil production could grow to million bpd in from currently million bpd
related significant crude build weighs on oil marketsthe country has already sanctioned expansion projects developing almost a billion barrels of oil resources in which have the potential to add about bpd production in the medium term
the notable development projects sanctioned over the past months include the expansion at bab thamama the second phase of qusahwira and haliba fields
in addition to these projects adnoc could potentially sanction and bring online further expansion of the bu hasa and umm shaif fields sustainable facilities project at bab and the upper zakum expansion where the production is expected to increase by bpd reaching million bpd
these developments could further boost the output by bpd by zonethe oil production from the neutral zone shared between saudi arabia and kuwait has been shut since
earlier this year the two sides began negotiations concerning the restart of the fields
rystad energy s base case incorporates a restart and gradual ramp up of fields in the neutral zone to about bpd in the medium term
