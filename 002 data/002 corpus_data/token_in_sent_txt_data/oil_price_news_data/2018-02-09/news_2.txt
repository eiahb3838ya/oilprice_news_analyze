the rise and fall of colombia’s shale industry
one of latin america s most stunning tales of economic development in recent years appears doomed to come to a bitter s reliance upon its abundant oil and gas reserves which saw production surge to a just over one million barrels daily in to drive its economic miracle appears on the brink of expiringat the end of the andean nation had oil reserves of a mere billion barrels or a of neighboring venezuela and an eighth of brazil s reserves compared to over billion barrels at the end of
it s believed that those reserves are only sufficient to support another five years of production at the current rate reported for of barrels has sent alarm bells ringing in bogota where oil revenues form an important source of government latin american nation once generated roughly a fifth of its national income from oil revenues royalties and taxation but that plummeted to nearly zero in as the protracted weakness of oil heavily impacted investment in the industry as well as exports
that becomes apparent when considering that export income from petroleum exports plummeted from percent of the value of total exports in to a mere third in

that significant decline saw the government record fiscal deficits of around percent of gdp from to with indications that the fiscal deficit will be just over percent in of the biggest issues that bogota is facing aside from dwindling oil reserves is that there have been no major oil discoveries since the caño limón field in
that has further amplified fears that colombia s oil wells are running dry
in the latin american nation s office of the comptroller general even stated given the historic fall in reserves at the existing oil fields will mark the end of the country s oil to address the issue the santo government has turned to unconventional oil exploration and fracking to boost reserves and has to some extent been inspired by argentina s successful attempt at turning around its own ailing energy sector when the de kirchner government nationalized ypf and pushed for a focus on the massive shale oil and gas potential of the vaca muerta in shale oil and gas potential exists in three of the andean nations basins the middle magdalena llanos and catatumbo basins
the emerging belief among industry insiders is that by tapping into shale oil they can add up to another billion barrels of reserves
most of the unconventional exploration efforts to date have been focused on the middle magdalena and it s believed that the la luna shale formation which is believed to be on par with the eagle ford shale could hold up to billion barrels of oil put that in perspective that s almost of the reserves held by the vaca muerta shale field which has been proclaimed to be the third largest on the planet
if the potential of the la luna can be truly realized it will be a saving grace for colombia s oil industry giving its reserves an important there s some activity in the basin with ecopetrol as well as canadian drillers canacol energy and parex resources having amassed sizable acreages it may take some time for exploration activities to reach the desired venezuela is moving from crisis to collapsethe prolonged weakness of oil immense breakeven costs that some analysts claim is as high as per barrel and security issues have all taken their toll on investment in colombia s energy to reuters investment by private oil companies in colombia will be up to billion in which is almost half of what it was in and nowhere near sufficient to fund the desperately needed shale oil exploration
most of that investment will occur in known conventional oil fields rather than riskier unconventional acreage as smaller drillers focus on deploying capital to boost oil reserves output and the peace with the largest insurgent group the farc should deliver a dividend for colombia s energy patch it will be limited due to the breakdown in peace talks and the ceasefire with the eln
since then the marxist inspired guerilla group has renewed its focus on attacking energy infrastructure including multiple pipeline bombings and the kidnapping of oil workers
that will not only disrupt colombia s oil output but also act as a deterrent for investment particularly in riskier oil assets such as shale oil colombia fails to significantly expand its oil reserves in the immediate future it will be a significant blow for the nation s economy and could potentially even trigger a crisis of confidence among foreign investors creating a vicious matthew smith for top reads from
