shale drillers are supersizing fracking
shale drillers have squeezed more oil out of a given well over the past few years by becoming more efficient in their drilling operations
but the industry is still scaling up and shale executives are now throwing around buzzwords such as cube development and supersizing referring to the massive footprint of today s the past shale companies figured out a way to cut costs while expanding production drilling more wells on a single wellpad
in essence that lowered the average cost of a shale well allowing drillers to do more with less
other techniques were also scaled up such as using more frac sand more water and drilling longer laterals
that allowed shale firms to survive during the downturn and it has also led to surging production that is breaking new records with each passing the process continues and shale companies are using that same logic today to continue to scale up
for instance as bloomberg reports encana is pursuing a drilling approach called cube development in which the company drills about wells from a single wellpad extending in every direction with the aim of extracting oil and gas from the multiple layers of the permian rather than each well targeting an individual shale term refers to the notion that the driller is accessing the entire cube beneath the surface rather than just the hydrocarbon resources immediately around the individual wells
t he permian is graduating gabriel daoud a jpmorgan chase analyst told bloomberg
now it s all about entering manufacturing mode
more and more shale companies are following this approach supersizing individual projects to pull more oil and gas out of the ground
related why is the spread shrinking the flip side is that some question the economics of such a massive project which encana has likened to a military occupation
the encana project likely cost around million jpmorgan analyst gabriel daoud said according to bloomberg
associated costs such as upgrading gathering lines using more labor additional equipment call into question whether supersizing really achieves the benefits of economies of scale
but encana says that because the approach can produce more oil and gas the costs have declined by a quarter at its supersized operations in canada s montney is one of the more aggressive companies in this regard with all of its wells set to come from these supersized wellpads
some texas shale drillers as bloomberg notes are a bit more cautious
pioneer natural resources and eog resources two notable texas shale firms are likely keeping the number of wells on a given wellpad in the single digits for the time being
a spokeswoman for eog resources expressed some concern that too many wells could impact overall productivity according to a similar phenomenon is playing out in the shale gas arena as well
according to the pittsburgh the top shale gas drillers in the marcellus shale are supersizing their operations
eqt the largest gas producer in the country is drilling as many as to gas wells per wellpad with laterals extending as long as miles in every direction
eqt like encana is also trying to hit multiple shale layers in one go rather than drilling individual wells for a specific section of the shale formation
related how the fed could hammer oil producersin an operation as large as this spending on a single project can run as high as a quarter of a billion dollars the shale companies are taking encana s approach at supersized well pads but drilling the wells in an incremental fashion
the idea is that the company can drill a half dozen shale wells wait for the market to catch up and then return to the same supersized wellpad and drill more wells
in the meantime much of the upfront cost for the wellpad and has already been spent and the additional wells are comparatively cheap to pull is not yet percent clear that the trend towards supersizing will be successful or that dozens of wells per wellpad is preferable to a smaller number
but if supesizing proves to be much more efficient then the upshot could be a shift towards more consolidation in the industry
shale companies could struggle compared to their larger corporate competitors lacking the financial heft to pull off supersized cube development
