u.s. oil data has markets confused
the oil market continues to stagger forward without direction and the eia data is offering little last week the eia reported a sharp build up in crude oil inventories raising concerns about over supply
but inventories have seesawed back and forth for much of this summer muddying the waters for analysts
just this week the agency reported a huge drawdown in stocks restoring some bullish sentiment and helping to push oil prices up more than per barrel on one of the signs of a bullish market in our view is that prices prove resilient to highly bearish data and can surge on moderate improvements standard chartered wrote in a note
the oil market currently fits that description prices recovered from last week s extremely bearish data and have risen on more encouraging signs this the investment bank publishes a index each week factoring in the reams of data that come out of the eia
last week s index hit or the weakest result in week the index jumped to not bullish by any means but a sharp improvement from last crude inventory decline of million barrels is the first thing that jumps out from the eia report
the drawdown was sharper than analysts had predicted and came a week after a huge week s jump in inventories corresponded with a flood of imports
similarly the sharp inventory decline in the most recent data is largely the result of a steep drop in imports at a time when refineries continued to run at elevated meant that lots of crude oil was taken out of inventory and processed into refined products
it s no surprise then that gasoline stocks rose and the build was which pushed gasoline stocks above the average
but analysts aren t concerned that this is a bearish signal
we expect the refinery maintenance season to begin soon correcting product oversupply standard chartered wrote in a note
related oil rallies but this country can t sell its crudeoil production rose again pushing output back up to million barrels per day
however the eia s new practice of rounding off production figures to the nearest bpd makes it tricky to discern production trends
the latest data suggests that there was an uptick in output from alaska not necessarily from shale in the fact problems in the permian are likely to act as a drag on growth for the near future
pipeline bottlenecks are compounded by a strain on services equipment and labor forcing some shale drillers to pivot away from west texas to other shale basins
in fact data from s p global platts finds that the permian is no longer the most profitable shale basin in the country
permian returns have fallen below that of the bakken and even the eagle ford and the stack
the drilling frenzy continues but the profits might not be what companies a lot of shale companies have locked themselves into hedges anyway
much of this year s hedged production was secured last year when oil prices were lower
so even if the permian discounts had not current hedged prices of for are slightly below oil strip prices of for
while this may provide some level of restraint in addition to greater focus on capital discipline to ramping ps on average raised their capital budgets by on average with results goldman sachs wrote in a note
related chinese oil futures remain endeavourhigher spending levels may not translate into more production this year
in fact investors are groaning on news that shale companies are boosting spending without much to show for it
but it may just be a case of delayed gratification
pipeline bottlenecks in the permian are leading to deferred completions
a massive backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells ducs continues to grow particularly in west texas
there is no sense in bringing that output online only to sell it at a steep discount
as such drillers are delaying completion even as they continue to ramp up companies such as pioneer natural resources continue to add rigs to the permian and have announced spending increases
but the production that stems from the increase in activity may not show up in the data until next dynamic has global implications
shale continues to grow but it is likely to suffer from a lull in growth for the next year or so
the supply story then is arguably a bullish one at least for the next months or so shale is slowing down at a time when iran s supply could be disrupted venezuela s production continues to fall and output in places like nigeria and libya is unstable
the demand side of the equation is a whole different story to be sure and a major reason why oil prices have declined this in the near term shale might end up being a bullish factor if it undershoots nick cunningham of top reads from
