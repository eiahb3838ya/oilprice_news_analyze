this super basin is about to make an epic comeback
alaska s north slope is a super basin awaiting a resurgence in oil production according to a new report
over the next eight years oil production could rise by north slope has been a significant source of oil and gas production for decades even though output has been in decline for a long time
aging fields such as the prudhoe bay field run by bp since the late were once prolific sources of production but have been gradually losing output year after year
prudhoe bay can claim to be the most productive oil field in history having produced billion barrels of oil as of last year
but it also peaked in the and has been losing output ever since
click to enlarge but the decline is not because alaska is running out of oil
output fell for a variety of reasons including high costs of production lack of infrastructure federal regulations keeping reserves off limits boom and bust price cycles among other factors
more recently the downturn in prices combined with skyrocketing shale production made risky plays like alaska not worth the alaska s north slope may still have a lot of life left in it
a new report from ihs markit concludes that the north slope is poised to as a major source of energy production with crude oil output potentially increasing as much as percent during the next eight based on recent discoveries ihs estimates that the north slope basin holds billion barrels of oil equivalent boe in remaining recoverable resources
that figure includes trillion cubic feet of natural gas and billion barrels of oil
ihs says that the estimated ultimate recovery eur of the north slope is billion boe the billion boe yet to be produced combined with the billion boe that has already been extracted
those numbers are worth emphasizing ihs is saying that there is twice as much oil yet to be produced than all of the oil produced from the north slope to date

far from it
ihs calls it an arrested super basin rather than a mature ihs defines super basin as a basin that has multiple reservoirs and source rocks diverse play types across numerous geologic horizons infrastructure with access to markets and established service sector and supply chains
the basin must also have at least billion boe in conventional remaining reserves and have already had produced at least billion previously thought of as a mature basin recent large discoveries made in the shallow nanushuk and torok formations indicate this basin has a lot of room left to grow beyond the endicott and ivishak formations which are the reservoirs from which the giant prudhoe bay and endicott fields produce said kareemah mohamed associate director of plays and basins research at ihs markit and lead author of the ihs markit analysis
this is why we refer to this basin as being in the because it still has such significant resources to that doesn t mean that a surge in output is inevitable
just because the oil is there doesn t mean it will be produced
sure a lot of formations may have been overlooked until now but many of the obstacles that plagued the region for a long time still remain
the north slope is still a remote and expensive place to drill lacking infrastructure and an adequate oilfield services sector to support production from new places
moreover ihs notes that uncertainty over state tax incentives also adds risk
related the next major challenge for norway s oil industryyet some of the hurdles that bedeviled the oil industry in the past appear to be surmountable
state permitting has been accelerated and drilling technology has improved
cost efficiencies from advances in drilling and operational practices will require the right kind of operator expertise mohamed said
for example conocophillips has employed learnings from its unconventional assets to lateral drilling in their alaska north slope development located in the national petroleum the oil industry may be able to apply lessons from shale drilling in the to alaska
just a few years ago royal dutch shell was spending billions of dollars to drill offshore in the chukchi sea hoping to use its engineering prowess to open up new frontiers
but the risks operational problems cost overruns bad press and ultimately low oil prices put an end to that campaign
more recent shallow water discoveries and the lessons learned from the shale bonanza have made onshore formations in the north slope appear more competitive at this for onshore opportunities in a stable country with a positive investment outlook the north slope provides a viable alternative to the competitive unconventional basins where acreage prices are an order of magnitude greater and have transportation and raw material constraints even if they are temporary mohamed nick cunningham of top reads from
