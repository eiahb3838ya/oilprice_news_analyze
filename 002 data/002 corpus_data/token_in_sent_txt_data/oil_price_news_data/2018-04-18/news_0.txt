shale boom creates new petrochemical hub
the natural gas production in the united states is benefiting not only consumers
the natural gas output is expected to bring benefits to the petrochemical industry as well as manufacturers will continue to enjoy feedstock for plants in and close to areas where shale gas and natural gas plant liquids ngpl production is abundant industry officials and analysts
dry natural gas production will set a new record this year averaging and will continue to rise in the eia said in its april energy the annual energy outlook the eia forecasts that dry natural gas production will increase through across a wide variety of alternative assumptions about the future
in the reference case which assumes current regulations and laws natural gas production is expected to grow by percent between and reaching in
the industrial sector which includes both lease and plant fuel and liquefaction fuel for liquefied natural gas lng exports currently consumes more natural gas than any other sector in the and its natural gas consumption is projected to grow faster than in any other sector
industrial natural gas consumption in the reference case is expected to increase by percent through increased natural gas production is the result of continued development of shale gas and tight oil which account for more than of natural gas production by the eia marcellus and utica plays in the east will be the main growth drivers of the shale gas production followed by the eagle ford and haynesville plays in the gulf coast region
associated natural gas production from tight oil production in the permian is also seen growing strongly
related oil prices rise on crude gasoline inventory drawngpl production in the is expected to nearly double from now until driven by growing global petrochemical industry demand according to the shale gas production boom provides a resource for petrochemicals plants with the gulf coast and the virginia region the prime spots for construction of new petrochemical to the shale crescent usa economic development initiative made up of businesses and regional economic partners the virginia crescent is in a position to challenge the gulf coast as the most profitable place for building a petrochemical plant greg kozera director of marketing for shale crescent usa writes in world quoted a recent report that shale crescent usa commissioned to ihs markit which found that a new facility in the shale crescent usa region would generate us billion more in profits than a comparable investment on the gulf coast
the supporting statistics in the report showed eia figures which said that natural gas from marcellus and utica accounted for around percent of total production in december and is expected to account for more than percent by the shale crescent usa initiative calls for investment in petrochemical plants in the east the gulf coast also sees a boom in refinery and petrochemical capacity with the center of the global petrochemical growth shifting from the middle east to the gulf coast
the middle east accounted for most of the petrochemical growth until
thanks to the shale revolution the gulf coast has caught up in capacity growth and between and the added around million tons of petrochemicals production capacity just below the capacity addition in the middle east the houston chronicle quoted ihs markit data as saying
by the will add another million tons of production than double the total capacity addition in the middle east which struggles to source new ethane supply and has to use more expensive crude is saudi arabia losing its asian oil market share not only companies are expanding capacity in the gulf coast
middle eastern saudi arabia s sabic and plan investments in the petrochemical industry which benefits from the is expanding its manufacturing capacity along the gulf coast with investments of us billion over a period to take advantage of the shale revolution
as part of this plan exxon and sabic selected last year a site in san patricio county texas for potential development of a jointly owned petrochemical recently saudi aramco s wholly owned downstream oil and gas subsidiary motiva enterprises signed a preliminary deal to study potential expansion into petrochemicals with the final investment decision expected in gas production growth already made the a net natural gas exporter in and a global player in lng exports
it s now providing abundant feedstock for petrochemicals whose global demand is only expected to tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
