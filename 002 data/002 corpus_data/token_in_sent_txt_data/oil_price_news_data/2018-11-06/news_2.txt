the clock is ticking for china’s oil independence
china is pulling out all stops in order to increase its oil and gas production but at the end of the day it will likely not be enough to stop the world s second largest economy from becoming over reliant on geopolitically charged crude oil and natural gas monday chinese oil majors cnpc and sinopec also asia s largest refinery said they were speeding up drilling and exploration from major tight oil and shale gas formations in the country s western regions
cnpc also said that new exploration in shale gas tight oil and tight gas will lead to growth in production for the country s largest oil and gas company added that the drilling cycle at the mahu field in xinjiang one of cnpc s largest findings in recent years fell around percent the previous year
a reuters report said this implies that oil wells are being completed and produced at a faster against a ticking clockchina s ambitions to develop more of its own oil and gas reserves is a race against a ticking clock

china oil fields are maturing and it s unlikely that significant discoveries can be found to replace depletion reserves
around five or six years ago beijing pegged its hope on emulating the us shale oil and gas success story even cutting deals with american firms to help develop china shell formations
however unlike most us shale formations china are in difficult reach rugged terrain indicating that shale oil and gas will not offer the solution that beijing energy planners needs at least in the foreseeable way out going forward for china is to diversify its oil and gas supply mix as much as possible and continue to reach global joint development agreements with both national and international oil companies an art that hydrocarbon deficient japan the world s third largest crude oil importer has executed brilliantly for tim daiss for top reads from
