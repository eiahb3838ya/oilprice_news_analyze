china to boost shale oil, gas production
china s biggest energy producers are tapping more tight oil and gas wells aiming to increase domestic oil and natural gas production at the world s largest crude oil importer and what will soon be the world s top natural gas part of a government push to boost domestic energy supply china national petroleum corporation cnpc and sinopec are raising investments to increase local oil and gas production and are accelerating drilling at tight oil and gas formations in western china the companies have recently demand continues to grow in china while domestic production has been declining in recent years
this has led to making china the world s largest crude oil importer
for natural gas a similar trend is apparent
a government drive to have millions of residents switch to natural gas from coal has resulted in china surpassing south korea last year to become the world s liquefied natural gas lng importer behind s natural gas production has been rising in recent months but the growth rate hasn t been even close to meeting the booming demand due to the government oil production on the other hand has been falling due to the depletion of mature conventional oil fields
desperate to meet this need chinese president xi jinping has ordered the companies to boost domestic production of oil and gas and firms are starting to follow the s drilling cycle at one of its biggest oil discoveries in recent years the mahu field has dropped percent from last year reuters quoted the company s newspaper as saying on monday
the drilling cycle decline implies a faster rate in completion of the wells according to reuters

sinopec s domestic crude oil production inched up by percent between january and september while natural gas output increased by percent the company said in its earnings release last s total crude oil production however dropped by percent compared to the same period a year earlier according to data from the national bureau of statistics of china
in september crude oil production in china fell percent compared to september gas production rose by percent annually in and by percent on the year in september the statistics bureau said in october

according to the gas report by the international energy agency iea because domestic production can t keep up with demand china will become the world s largest natural gas importer by
due to the country s policy to reduce air pollution china is expected to account for percent of the global increase in natural gas consumption between and more than any other china s natural gas demand is expected to rise by an average percent per year accounting for over a third of global demand increase the iea said in its report
the share of imports in china s natural gas supply is seen rising from percent to percent by the agency companies are trying to increase domestic oil and natural gas are succeeding in gas the pace of china s oil and gas demand growth means that imports will play even more of a leading role in its future energy demand and in the global oil and gas tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
