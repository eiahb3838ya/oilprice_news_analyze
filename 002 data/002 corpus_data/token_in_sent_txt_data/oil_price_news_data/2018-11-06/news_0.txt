the truth about iran oil sanction waivers
the trump administration has dropped the hammer officially putting sanctions on iran s oil exports
why then might iran s oil exports actually increase in the near future the granted waivers to eight countries allowing them to continue to import oil from iran for a period
washington spun the waivers as a brief period of time that would allow a handful of countries to get their imports from iran down to zero
some countries really depend on iran so a grace period would give them a bit more government was a bit defensive about the action
no one s going to argue that secretary pompeo isn t tough on iran secretary of state mike pompeo said on fox news and no one is going to argue that president trump isn t doing the he cited the loss of around million barrels per day of iranian oil exports as evidence that the policy was working
that number will fall yet the president himself revealed the logic behind the waivers
we have the toughest sanctions ever imposed but on oil we want to go a little bit slower because i do want to drive the oil prices in the world president trump told reporters on monday
i could get the iran oil down to zero immediately but it would cause a shock to the it s highly debatable that the could have succeeded in slashing iran s oil exports to zero but even if it did succeed there is little doubt that oil prices would be substantially higher than they are eight countries granted waivers included south korea taiwan turkey greece japan china india and italy
many of these countries had already made sharp reductions in their purchases of iranian oil which allowed them to curry favor with washington as they sought some leniency on sanctions
related the rapid acceleration towards peak oil demandnotably however south korea and japan had already zeroed out their imports from iran well ahead of the deadline
the waivers for them then are a bit curious
the trump administration may have wanted to reward allies that had been cooperative
however it could also allow them to resume purchases of iranian s trade minister hiroshige seko said on tuesday that japanese refiners could begin buying oil from iran again now that they have a exemption
south korea could also import around bpd from iran again which is notable since south korea hasn t purchased oil from iran since june according to the chinese refiners who also cut their purchases are interested in buying oil once again according to reuters
china will be allowed to buy around bpd which is about half of what the country imported over the past two years
an unnamed trader told reuters that enquiries for cargoes from iran are coming in from several asian combined the exemptions will allow iran to continue to export oil and it might even be able to increase exports from current levels
iran exported somewhere around million barrels per day in october and according to s p global platts might export around in november
but the losses could potentially stop there and might even rise if some countries resume is likely that iranian oil exports will stabilise at their present level of a good million barrels per day commerzbank said in a note
exports could even increase again in the coming months because japan and south korea have hardly been buying any iranian oil of late amid uncertainty ahead of the sanctions and as a gesture of goodwill towards the the investment bank said the waivers and the potential increase in shipments to asia is bad news for oil prices
related bolton is preparing more sanctions against iranthere is quite a bit of disagreement over the trajectory of iran s exports
citi s ed morse told bloomberg tv that oil prices are actually biased to the upside for the rest of the year
morse said that oil prices could average per barrel in the fourth quarter and might even spike to or
he noted that whether or not such scenarios play out largely depend on iran as well as some other potential while the market is suddenly bearish on oil because of iran waivers morse notes that the waivers are only temporary and that the trump administration won t allow countries receiving waivers to import unlimited quantities
how much oil is being granted from iran to each of those eight countries
we can only surmise until we get a tweet from somebody in the government morse told bloomberg analysts agreed with that sentiment
we do not see the eight countries having carte blanche to import what they like the consultancy fge said in a bottom line is that there is not a lot of clarity regarding what to expect on iran s exports
the waivers could allow exports to stabilize and perhaps even edge up temporarily
however the trump administration is keen on tightening the screws
the waivers expire in may and surely the wants iran s exports to be lower by washington will only be able to move as fast as the oil market allows which after months of bluster is something that the administration finally we will ensure that as more barrels of iranian crude and condensate come off the market that we accomplish our national security objectives without increasing the price of oil brian hook head of the state department iran action group told reporters on a conference call
we have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to do that s the goal but it remains to be seen if the oil market is loose enough to allow for that harder line on nick cunningham of top reads from
