is shale the future for big oil?
if anyone had compared shale oil to google five years ago it would have sounded strange
yet when last week in a report wood mackenzie s chairman and chief analyst simon flower did just that comparing shale oil to the faang stocks he had a good reason to do so
shale oil is the star of the decade as far as the global energy industry is concerned and now even big oil has woken up to this a report detailing the relationship of big oil and shale wood mac s analysts forecast a bright future for both with the share of shale oil in the supermajors total production rising from the current bpd to million bpd in before it starts declining
this will represent a tenth of the supermajors total production wood mac s research analyst roy martin said in the it s not just the supermajors that are expanding their shale oil footprint at a fast pace
large independents are getting larger too
as houston chronicle commentator chris tomlinson noted in a recent story on the same topic seasoned oil executives know that when both prices and production rise it s time to cash out and sell to the big there s a consolidation underway in the shale patch and it will likely continue for some time until tomlinson argues only the strongest players remain all in a position to benefit from the marriage of lower costs higher drilling and production efficiency and consequently consistent output the most notable acquisitions in this area so far this year were bhp billiton s sale of its shale operations to bp for us billion after it was pressured by elliott management to exit shale as well as encana s purchase of newfield exploration for us billion and chesapeake s acquisition of wildhorse resource development for us billion
according to tomlinson the total value of m a deals in shale since the start of the year stands at us billion
but as it usually happens if it looks to good to be true it probably starters not all supermajors are so bent on growing in shale
french total and italian eni have so far shunned shale oil and there are no indications they are likely to change their stance anytime soon
related analysts see opportunities in embattled energy stocks i have nothing against the permian total s patrick pouyann√© said this spring at ceraweek in response to a question about why total has not followed suit with the other supermajors
he added at the time that he thought it was an incredible area for competitors who already have positions there
for a company like total it s not just a matter of ticking the box to produce bpd it makes no sense the ceo said adding that when i think of areas of investment i need to target bpd if i m a serious italy s eni is apparently following a similar logic with both european supermajors more interested in offshore exploration and africa than in shale
given the capital intensiveness of shale oil production their logic is even those with an established position in the shale patch are facing challenges investors are also aware of the capital intensiveness of shale oil production and they are still suspicious of executives
chesapeake s stocks for example dived by percent on the announcement of the wildhorse purchase
investors in shale oil are mistrustful and companies will need a lot more time as well as free cash flow and returns to convince them that all is good once again
that s why as houston chronicle s tomlinson said in his analysis investors will do well to keep up the pressure on oil companies to maximize efficiency and produce profits because the future is by irina slav for top reads from
