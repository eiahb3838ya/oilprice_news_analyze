u.s. shale’s glory days are numbered
there are some early signs that the shale industry is starting to show its age with depletion rates on the study from wood mackenzie found that some wells in the permian wolfcamp were suffering from decline rates at or above percent after five years much higher than the to percent originally anticipated
if you were expecting a well to hit the normal or percent after five years and you start seeing a percent decline this becomes more of a reserves issue than an economics issue said dukes a director at industry consultant wood mackenzie according to bloomberg
as a result you have to grow activity year over year or it gets harder and harder to offset moreover shale wells fizzle out much faster than major offshore oil fields which is significant because the boom in shale drilling over the past few years means that there is more depletion in absolute terms than ever before
a slowdown in drilling will mean that depletion starts to become a serious separate study from goldman sachs takes a deep look at whether or not the shale industry is starting to see the effects of age
the investment bank says the average life span for the most transformative areas of global oil supply is between and of these rapid growth periods include the ussr in the mexico and the north sea in the late venezuela s heavy oil production in the brazil in the early and shale and canada s oil sands in the
each had their period in the limelight but ultimately many of them plateaued and entered an extended period of decline though some suffering steeper declines than others

shale is entering the lower end of this range at about years
while shale is still growing there are some signs that the shale tail which goldman says is the phase when shale becomes a less meaningful driver of global oil supply may not be that far lays out the five signals to watch out for which would indicate that the glory days of shale are over
although goldman says the real trouble may be a few years off there is some evidence that some of those dynamics are beginning to occur
the investment bank offers a breakdown as
when inventory is being revised down not up
this is already occurring in some areas such as the eagle ford
goldman notes that eog resources inventory fell in the eagle ford in the second quarter with the company having drilled more wells than it added in new
when well productivity stops improving
this one is inconclusive although perhaps it is beginning to become a concern
goldman notes that the industry posed explosive productivity gains in but those gains slowed this year
decline rates have accelerated in the eagle ford and delaware basin but in the aggregate there may still be some room for improvement for a little
when supply cost rises for structural reasons
costs have climbed recently but largely because of cyclical reasons goldman argues
high rates of drilling have created bottlenecks and pushed up costs but those would come down if the cycle soured
it is still early for this
when capital shifts to other regions
this looks the least threatening of the five warning signs
shale remains a top priority and the oil majors have stepped up their spending in shale pivoting out of other regions
spending on crashed and hasn t recovered
there has been some shifting of capital within shale plays such as from the permian to the eagle ford and the bakken but this is mostly due to pipeline
when growth is no longer lagging indicator
goldman sachs still sees shale adding million at least through
this indicator won t become clear until the production gains actually start slowing down
related are natural gas prices set to spike the investment bank says that companies are still a solid bet through the early and it singles out companies like concho resources or pioneer natural resources two large permian drillers
but by shale e ps will begin to see their stars that point goldman warns investors to pivot out of shale companies and focus either on diversified companies that have assets outside of shale or on the integrated oil majors
w e believe future resource additions outside shale deemed low on the cost curve will likely be positively received by investors goldman stated citing hess as a company that might fit this description because of the huge oil fields it is developing with exxonmobil in offshore another way depletion will become a greater theme in the future so companies that are sitting on assets that deplete quickly will fall out of favor
those that can stave off declines will fare much investment bank still expects shale to add around million barrels per day each year through at least
but with early signs of strain limits on productivity and steeper decline rates it is clear that the industry s glory days are nick cunningham of top reads from
