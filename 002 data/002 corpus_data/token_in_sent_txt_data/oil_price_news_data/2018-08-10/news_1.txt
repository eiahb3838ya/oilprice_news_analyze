why is big oil so excited about alaskan crude?
in an unprecedented move alaska officials recently published huge quantities of oil exploration data in an attempt to attract the attention of drilling companies to the state s north slope fields
notably the unexpected data dump includes valuable seismic surveys revealed as part of the state s tax credit program for oil report named special alaska lease sale areas salsa was released last month and includes a groundbreaking and sizeable collection of data gathered over decades of alaskan oil exploration
the information is distributed across many alaskan agencies and would therefore be extremely difficult to gather by an outside interest
the highly valuable data if gathered today would take months to collect and cost hundreds of millions of dollars according to the salsa report the curious public and potential investors can find detailed information about specific wells leases and the quality of certain reservoirs where oil and gas have been found over the last decades
also perhaps most importantly newly released reports of seismic surveys which legally can only be released ten years after the survey is conducted dozens more will be released in the coming years as they become legally available data reported in salsa focuses on three drilling sites on the alaskan north slope harrison bay just north of national petroleum reserve fields currently under development by conocophillips gwydyr bay north of the prudhoe bay oil field and storms an inland region south of prudhoe bay
combined the three areas add up to about who has the right to resources in the caspian sea if all goes according to the state s plans oil companies will see the numbers as an enticing investment opportunity and an open invitation to bid on leases in the area
the timing of the report is opportune as special sale of the three aforementioned north slope leases will be held later this year alongside alaska s annual december lease goal of the data release is that private interests will use the information to discover previously overlooked deposits like the discovery of the massive pikka oil field which has the potential to produce up to billion barrels of oil
after years of diminishing returns in the once mighty north slope pikka is just one of three major recent finds that revived interest in the north slope in a massive we reported around this time last year alaskan oil was in big trouble
the state was over a billion dollars in debt the north slope and cook inlet oil fields were facing thousands of layoffs the pipeline system was all but dry and many alaskans were growing weary of their state s dependence on oil at any cost to the canadian oil crisis continues as prices plungemany of these issues persist the state is still in debt many alaskans particularly the inuit communities who lived on this land far before oil was discovered beneath it are still resentful of the environmental damage big oil brings to the fragile ecosystems and cnbc just gave the state the unenviable title of worst in the nation for there s still hope for alaska
thanks to major efforts like the salsa report and the upcoming special sale it looks like it might finally be time for a turnaround in the alaskan economy
alaskan unemployment while still in a considerable slump is slowly improving having dropped from the highest in the nation percent to percent in june
some are saying that alaska holds significant promise for unconventional oil and gas production conocophillips is making progress on their planned willow oil development in the north slope and they ve made it clear that they plan to keep exploring in the is not out of the woods yet and economic improvement won t be immediate
they have a long way to go to climb out of the extreme debt and dismal unemployment and poverty rates
it will require a lot of work and patience from government business and the public alike but for the first time in a long time there is a lot of hope for the north haley zaremba for top reads from
