the two factors to watch in todayâ€™s oil markets
the bulls have gained the upper hand in oil markets of late with estimates of oil before the end of the year
the driving factor behind this renewed bullishness is the of sanctions on iran that threaten to significantly impact iranian exports
while this bullish sentiment is certainly justifiable there are also plenty of bearish catalysts looming over markets that should not be ignored
the most important of these catalysts is the possibility of an trade war between china and the an outcome that is very much plausible
oil prices in the coming months are likely to be influenced most heavily by these two contrasting factors with iranian sanctions sending prices up while trade war escalations sending them and iran saga has had a grip over oil markets for the last three months
oil prices spiked in may when trump announced that he was imposing sanctions on iran and leaving the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa
now as the first round of sanctions goes into effect the relationship between iran and the has become increasingly strained
the second round of sanctions which is going to focus on the energy sector will have a much higher impact than the current round
according to different estimates sanctions could take anywhere from to million barrels out of the market
this combined with the recent worries about spare capacity and the ongoing tension in the arabian peninsula between yemeni houthis and ksa may well drive prices towards the there is certainly a possibility of a more than one million bpd decline in iranian oil there are some who suggest the decline will be significantly less than that
it is important to note that india and china account for almost percent of iranian oil exports between them and likely have the ability to boost their imports
click to enlarge the stance of india is a little vague but they have cleared that they will only comply with un mandated sanctions and are reportedly looking to find alternate ways of payment in order to continue buying oil from iran
china has clearly stated that it will not implement any cut in its imports from iran
eu accounting for another big chunk of iran s oil wants to retain the current iran deal and is trying its best to rescue while iranian sanctions may excite oil bulls they remain very much a wild card for oil second major factor to watch in today s oil markets is the ongoing trade war between china and the president trump recently escalated this trade war with a second round of sanctions on billion worth of chinese products
china has said that it will retaliate with billion of its own tariffs and has made it clear that it will not back down
it is generally accepted that trade wars are bad for the global economy and the oil market is no exception
oil prices tanked percent in a single day after trump announced the billion tariffs
as these tariffs continue to escalate the impact on oil markets will likely a price spike looms for natural gasshan saeed chief economist at iqi global malaysia and apec region is very bullish on oil and sees it at claiming that geopolitical risk and tight supply constraint have given oil prices a new head to stay on the bullish course
understanding geography is a real virtue for sophisticated investors
on the demand side he added that demand for oil would touch million barrel per day by the influence of sanctions on oil prices however is subject to the response of china india the eu and iran itself
bulls may well have an argument but they lack any sort of certainty when it comes to quantifying the impact of sanctions
the outcome of the trade war by comparison is quite certain lower oil prices
it is this certainty that might give oil bulls pause for thought as the end of the year other factors such as inventory figures rig count global demand and supply will continue to shape oil markets it is the major factors that are going to have a significant and sustainable osama rizvi for top reads from
