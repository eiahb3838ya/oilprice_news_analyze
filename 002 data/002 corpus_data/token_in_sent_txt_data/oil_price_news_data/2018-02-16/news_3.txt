explaining saudi arabia’s oil export strategy
saudi arabia continues to keep the market informed about its stance on the opec production cut deal with khalid latest guidance that saudi would prefer to overtighten the market than exit early from cuts channeling neil young better to burn out than fade away has gained a great deal of credibility over the last of a year by outlining saudi next move in terms of exports then following through on it
we should therefore take heed from his latest also signaled that the kingdom will continue to keep its crude exports in check next month holding below million barrels per day
this is no surprise and will be their stance until at least the saudi aramco can see from our clipperdata that a good deal of opec success in lowering oecd inventories has been by directing exports to emerging markets highlighted before that saudi arabia took about million barrels off the global market last year via lower exports

we first highlighted in march of last year that saudi arabia could be supplementing its lost revenues from the opec oil production cut deal by exporting more can see from our clipperdata below that saudi middle distillate exports outpaced levels in each of the last seven months of last year by an average of bpd over the period
this year has also started off strongly well above january higher refining capacity in the kingdom could explain away this increase as could higher demand as we discussed earlier this week it is interesting that the increase in middle distillate exports last june coincided with change in strategy for crude exports
