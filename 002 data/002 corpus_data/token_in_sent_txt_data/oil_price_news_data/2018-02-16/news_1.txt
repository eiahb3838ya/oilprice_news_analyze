offshore oil is poised for significant growth
following three painful years of portfolio repositioning cost cuts and deferred projects the offshore oil and gas industry is now more prepared to deliver projects and profits at lower costs and simpler designs
currently shale is taking center stage in analyses about oil growth stories and rightfully so it s growing at a much faster pace than previously expected
but cost inflation and investor pressure to prefer profits over production may slow down the pace of that growth going offshore oil which suffered from slashed investments during the downturn is now coming back with projects that have improved economics in some cases challenging those of shale
that s due to the costs that major oil companies slashed after to simpler designs and to the supermajors reshaping portfolios and projects to make as much money at brent as they were making at brent four years to analysts at bernstein some new offshore projects could be approved this year a significant rise compared with projects approved last year and with just projects in which according to reuters data was the lowest number since at least
most of the new offshore projects are also expected to be leaner and smaller and average bpd of oil equivalents compared to bpd for last year s projects according to majors have already announced some impressive cost reductions in offshore said last month that it would redevelop the penguins oil and gas field in the uk north sea with a price below per barrel and peak production at around statoil said earlier this month that it had reduced the breakeven for the first phase of its johan sverdrup offshore project to below per oil rig count rises as prices recover their focus on simplification design enhancements and execution efficiencies have made their offshore prospects competitive with north american shale projects matthew fitzsimmons vp cost analysis at rystad energy said commenting on the johan sverdrup cost much is made of the permian its flexibility and the returns there
but actually infill drilling for a decade creates enormous sources of money bernard looney head of bp s upstream division told reuters
you will see more deepwater over time for sure looney noted
offshore development is needed if the industry is to offset the natural decline of currently producing oil fields because even with the production boom shale accounts for just percent of the global oil supply of million bpd whereas offshore oil makes up more than of are signs that optimism is returning to the upstream and companies will continue to prefer oil developments this year according to energy consultancy wood majors and national oil companies nocs are expected to compete fiercely for discovered resource opportunities offshore brazil bolstered by deepwater economics woodmac says expecting mexico s licensing rounds to draw strong bidding this year as well
deepwater gulf of mexico which was badly bruised during the downturn is also expected to stage a comeback this year wood mackenzie reckons
the tax overhaul drastically increased the fiscal competitiveness of deepwater gulf of mexico relative to other offshore basins woodmac current production in the gulf of mexico can t be sustained with conventional deepwater fields william turner wood mackenzie s senior research analyst and lead author of the deepwater gom things to look for in insight is this the future for opec increased investments in exploration and development especially in ultra technologies and projects are crucial not only to maintaining the current pace of production but also in unlocking the next phase of significant volumes in the region turner a result of the oil price crash global offshore investments have plunged from the highs of billion as companies had to reassess how to make projects profitable in the lower oil price world rystad energy says
the sentiment turned positive in and this year will be the bottom of the global offshore investments at billion before investments start to grow steadily year by year going this growth comes from high offshore activity driven mainly by an increasing oil price and companies ability to cut costs to improve the profitability of their projects emil varre sand√∏y at rystad energy offshore investments will manage to recover to billion which will still be percent lower than the high but which will show that the industry will stick to strict cost management rystad says
