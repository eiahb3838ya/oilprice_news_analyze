opec and shale keep oil prices between $60-$75
the interaction between shale and opec will continue to be the dominant narrative in the oil market this year and the opposing forces could end up trapping oil prices within a relatively narrow price sentiment has shifted quite a bit over the past month with the impact of the opec cuts sparking bullish sentiment and huge price gains in january
but the surge in shale production has decidedly broken the fever and oil prices have retreated sharply from their highs amid fears of another dynamic could continue for quite a while with prices and sentiment seesawing back and forth
nevertheless while opec and shale drillers duke it out those too opposing forces could put lower and upper bounds on oil prices keeping trading within a relatively tight trading range of to per barrel for brent according to a new report from the oxford institute for energy prices creep up towards the upper end of that range shale will accelerate adding new supply onto the market and pulling oil prices back down
there is little room below per barrel however as the opec cuts continue to keep supply off the market
moreover oil demand remains strong and will continue to soak up a good chunk of the additional barrels coming onto the market
taken together prices will likely trade between a and range with oies forecasting an average brent price of about per barrel this year
click to enlarge source the oxford institute for energy studiesthe argument is a variation of the shale band theory popularized a few years ago during the depths of the oil market downturn
according to that theory which put more responsibility on shale specifically prices seemed to trade between and for quite an extended period of time with the unique tendencies of shale drilling throwing up resistance on those upper and lower bounds
if prices dropped to per barrel and below shale drillers went out of business and supply was curtailed pushing prices back up
if prices flirted with per barrel a new wave of shale drilling suddenly appeared and dragged crude benchmarks back tesla s powerpack real hope or mostly hype that dynamic is more or less alive and well except that opec has decided to raise the price floor a bit by taking million barrels per day off of the market a deal that has been in place for over a year
now the floor for brent is more solidly at the price level rather than or course this is just a forecast and is subject to uncertainty on many levels some of which could force oil prices to shoot above or below the range
on the downside opec s exit from its production cuts could end up being more chaotic than the market currently calculates
there are a few ways this could go
first higher production levels from nigeria libya or iraq are possible
once output rises and compliance falls there is less pressure on the whole group to maintain compliance
or the market tightens to such a degree that there is a bit of disagreement about what to do at the june meeting
a messy exit from the agreement could lead to output and lower prices
for now it does not seem likely that opec will emerge as a black swan to the oil market this year
all signs strong compliance and very clear statements of support for maintaining the cuts point to strong cohesion at this downside threat is shale
as widely noted output is expected to exceed this year a year sooner than previously thought
the wave of output is expected to lead to another buildup in inventories which keep oil prices at the lower end especially if demand brings up another threat to prices
demand is strong right now the iea puts demand growth at opec says which will prevent shale from crashing prices
but if demand disappoints there is much more room for prices to oil rig count rises as prices recoverthe flip side is that unexpected supply disruptions could blow up the price band scenario with a decline from venezuela in particular a notable possibility
the loss of from venezuela would add something like per barrel to the oil price averaged out for the year oies says
a but event of over of output losses would push brent over for the of course is the uncertainty over shale
shale output is a downside risk to prices but because the market is now pricing in huge production gains the opposite effect could also play out
if shale undershoots in terms of output that will likely translate into a bullish effect on all of those factors individually are mere speculation
taken all together oies says that shale and opec could trap crude between and this nick cunningham of top reads from
