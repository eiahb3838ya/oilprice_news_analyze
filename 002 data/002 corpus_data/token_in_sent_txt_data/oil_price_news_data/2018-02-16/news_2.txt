iran fails to comply with opec deal
the opec monthly oil market report is out production data for january
all data unless otherwise noted is through january and is in thousand barrels per crude only production has held steady for three months
however this chart masks the fact that november production was revised downward by barrels per day and december production was revised downward by barrels per day
january production was barrels per day below last year s average of barrels per day and barrels per day lower than opec s month average of barrels per day
opec oil production was down just barrels per day in january
november production was revised down bpd and december production was revised down by bpd
the largest revisions were for venezuela
their production was revised down bpd in november and bpd in december
algeria like at least other opec countries is in continuous decline
angola peaked in at a average of barrels per day are currently about a quarter of a million barrels per day below that number
ecuador s crude oil production increased steadily for four and years from to january of and has been on a bumpy decline for the last three years
equatorial guinea s chart speaks for itself
i really don t know why they joined opec
their production is clearly in decline but is not enough to make much difference either way
everything i said about equatorial guinea can also be said about gabon
iran is obviously ignoring any opec request to cut production and are producing every possible barrel they can
iraq s average peaked so far last year at barrels per day
their january crude oil production was barrels per day below that average
are they deliberately cutting production
if so not by much
kuwait s chart looks strange to my eye
i believe kuwait is one of two and possibly three opec countries that could increase production somewhat
the others are saudi arabia and possibly the united arab emirates
libya is struggling
if peace ever breaks out in libya they could increase production somewhat
but peace doesn t seem to be on the horizon in libya
nigerian crude oil production has a general downward trend
how much of this trend is due to political problems
some of it no doubt
but definitely not all of it
qatar peaked in
and i won t say so far here
they are clearly in decline
saudi crude oil production has been holding steady for months now
saudi is the only opec nation that could increase production by any considerable amount
they could possibly increase production from one quarter to one half million barrels per day
but likely a lot closer to one quarter million per possibly
the uae is one of the other two opec nations that just might be able to increase production somewhat
but i have more doubts about the uae than i do about kuwait
venezuela is in the grasp of a collapse
their production has fallen barrels per day in the last three months
their november production was revised downward by barrels per day and their december production was revised downward by barrels per is in danger of becoming a totally failed state like somalia
the worse things get the worse things get
that is falling income from oil exports increases the chance that production will continue to fall
all income from exports will have to be used to keep the public from total rebellion and none will be left for the oil fields
looking at a chart puts opec crude only production in a much clearer perspective
on this chart is january only
the point here is that opec cuts are not making much of a difference
world oil production is on that proverbial bumpy plateau
click to enlarge saudi kuwait and the uae began to increase production in may of and peaked in november of that year
the other opec countries peaked in july seven months after the opec cuts began
they were all at that time producing flat out
and in my opinion still the three opec countries saudi kuwait and the uae are likely capable of increasing production they in my opinion can in no way increase production to what they were producing in late
that was a period where they made heroic efforts to increase production in order to establish a point from which they could cut production
that level was then and is now unsustainable
and if you remove venezuela from the mix then the combined production of the other are at an high or nearly so
the increase in production of the countries represented in this chart for the last two years has been all iran recovering from sanctions and libya recovering from rebel attacks
iraq has been relatively flat over the last two years and everyone else has declined
opec production in the above chart is crude only
it does not even include condensate
but world supply here is total liquids
so they are comparing apples to oranges
natural gas liquids in the last few years have increased far more than crude oil alone
the above chart is from the eia and is only through october
world has been on a bumpy plateau since july of
this is russia thru january
the data is from the russian minister of energy
the data was in tons and i am using a conversion factor of barrels per top reads from
