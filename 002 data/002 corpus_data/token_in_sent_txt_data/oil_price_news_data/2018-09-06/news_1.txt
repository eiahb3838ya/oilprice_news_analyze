the next global oil hotspot
there are at least billion untapped barrels of crude oil in africa the geological survey estimated two years ago
during the downturn oil companies bought licenses there and waited for the price environment to improve to advance their drilling plans
independents such as tullow oil and kosmos oil expanded on the continent alongside supermajors such as bp
now these drilling plans are gathering is one of the hot spots
a newcomer on the oil scene the landlocked country has welcomed tullow oil cnooc and total in its regions
the country s government sees investments of us billion made into its oil industry during the next three to four years and plans to build a pipeline to the tanzanian coast and a refinery to jumpstart an oil industry even though no oil is being produced in uganda is another focus of attention
the sne project comprising three offshore blocks might contain up to billion barrels of crude australian explorer far one of the partners developing the sne said
the partnership also includes conocophillips cairn senegal s oil company petrosen
the final investment decision on the project is expected next year
the first phase of the project would tap an estimated million is also a potential major gas producer
kosmos and in the offshore gas discovery tortue that extends into mauritania a final investment decision fid for the greater tortue project around the end of and are aiming for first gas in is another african oil hopeful
first oil in kenya was found in by tullow oil and in june this year the east african country even started exporting crude under a pilot scheme that would see bpd trucked to the port city of mombasa and stored until there is enough to be loaded on tankers and shipped abroad
related oil next hotspot the cowboy statetullow oil just announced that it was spudding a well off the namibian shore an example of another country that few would have associated with oil yet is staking a claim in the industry
the cormorant prospect may hold crude oil resources of million barrels
tullow has partnered with india s ongc videsh on the supermajors are also there
shell earlier this year announced its first exploration rights acquisition in mauritania
senegal s neighbor seems to be more promising in gas rather than oil with its only producing oil field chingetti currently being decommissioned
yet gas is increasing in prominence and if exploration results live up to expectations mauritania would garner further attention from the industry in addition to bp exxon total tullow and petronas which already have a presence also recently entered namibia last month the supermajor bought a stake in an offshore exploration license
although no oil has yet been discovered in namibia there is a theory that its offshore basins may share characteristics with brazil s campos and and namibia were part of one whole a few billion years hughes data cited by bloomberg shows that offshore drilling rigs around africa are at a high
rystad has forecast that offshore exploration wells will be drilled this year in africa compared with roughly half that in
if prices stay where they are explorers might add quite a lot of future oil and gas supply from african irina slav for top reads from
