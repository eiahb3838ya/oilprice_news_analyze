does conoco know something that its competition doesnâ€™t?
when everyone in oil seems like they are ready to pay anything for a piece of land in the permian basin a report that one oil company is actually selling permian acreage might come as something of a shock
it doesn t make sense at least at first glance
but conoco this week announced just is offloading assets in the permian and south texas to the tune of us the same update conoco announced the acquisition of acreage in the montney conventional play in canada and in the austin chalk in louisiana
one can t help but wonder if conoco doesn t know something the rest of big oil has been s hardly the case
conoco is in fact following its strategy of buying low and selling high while securing its business against the new normal in oil markets which comes down to permanently excessive price volatility and a heightened risk of another meltdown like the one in energy vet and forbes author david blackmon noted in a recent story that the news about conoco s asset sale in the permian is not as shocking as it sounds when you first hear it because of the nature of the assets sold
for conoco blackmon says it s not a priority to hold onto all its acreage in the hottest shale play in the world at any cost
the company s priority is to streamline its portfolio as much as possible focusing on potentially assets and offloading the conoco has not left the permian
it has a pretty robust position there
the assets it sold were small underdeveloped patches of land
conversely the montney assets are adjacent to acreage the company already has in this part of canada and they cost just us million
conoco did not give a price for its louisiana acquisition but executive vice president matt fox said in the announcement of the acquisitions that the acreage we ve acquired in louisiana and the montney has the potential to add to our low cost of supply resource base without requiring significant capital related trade war looms over oil marketsthe second part of this quote is important
conoco is in no rush to boost its capex after oil prices improved unlike many of its peers
in fact it is keeping its belt tightened for the foreseeable future it seems
and it is already reaping the benefits of this the past months conoco s share price gained almost percent as opposed to an almost slide for exxon
it has chosen to share the benefits from higher oil prices with its shareholders and make sure there will be more of these benefits to s sustaining cost per barrel is us
at the start of february the company announced it will lift the dividend by percent and buy back shares worth us billion despite booking a loss for
conoco also paid down us billion in debt and bought back us billion in shares
besides it reported a organic reserve base replacement tactics are clear enough pay down debt return cash to shareholders boost reserve base
it sounds like the most sensible thing to do under any circumstances but the most sensible thing has not been a characteristic of the oil industry traditionally growth has been the top conoco is showing its peers clearly that this prioritization is flawed
it is also demonstrating that the best acreage is not necessarily in the hottest that a few analysts have already noted
conoco is bucking the trend and is irina slav for top reads from
