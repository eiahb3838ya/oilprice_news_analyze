is history repeating itself in oil markets?
back in shale production was growing so fast that it ended up crashing the market
now history could be repeating was the warning from the international energy agency which said in its latest oil market report that a second wave of shale supply threatens another global oil supply is expected to grow faster than demand this year which could lead to another downturn
it s a conclusion that the iea tried to emphasize in previous reports but the message finally seems to be sinking extraordinary run up in benchmark prices in december and january came to a startling end two weeks ago
part of the reason was because of the broader market turmoil in equities and part of it was because hedge funds and other money managers had overbought oil futures exposing the market to a price as the iea notes the real worry is rising oil supply which means that the underlying oil market fundamentals in the early part of look less supportive for it isn t all bad news for benchmark prices
the iea noted that due to the opec production cuts and strong demand inventories fell at a remarkable rate last year
the oil inventory surplus currently stands at about million barrels above the average down sharply from million barrels a year ago
importantly while crude oil inventories are closing in on the average total stocks of gasoline and other refined products have already fallen well below that threshold
with the surplus having shrunk so dramatically the success of the output agreement might be close to hand the iea wrote

in the period ending in november the added a colossal the iea noted with even steeper gains expected this year
the bearish forecast comes a week after the eia said much of the same thing shale output is rising so quickly that the could reach million barrels per day this year instead of next year
by the end of the could surpass russia and saudi arabia in terms of total iea says that the stars are aligning for shale with rising prices leading after a few months to more drilling more completions more production and more some of these figures and forecasts have been floating around for a little while now but the iea put the situation in stark terms
the agency says that the current growth trajectory in shale production is reminiscent of the first wave of us shale growth that riding the tide of high oil prices in the early years of this decade made big gains in terms of market share and eventually in forced a historic change of policy by leading supply growth from the alone could equal total global demand other words shale growth could crash oil prices again and the only thing preventing a collapse is opec sticking with its production limits
back in the cartel decided to abandon market management which precipitated the meltdown
this is a sobering thought for otherproducers currently sitting on production capacity and facing a renewed challenge to their market share the iea price meltdown isn t an inevitability
demand looks strong and could expand by more than everyone assumes
meanwhile venezuela s rapid deterioration could also take more oil supply off of the market
if opec maintains high levels of compliance the oil market could weather the new wave of shale supply and return to a more bullish footing later this year as demand soaks up the if demand disappoints or if more supply comes from unexpected places libya s output apparently hit a high in january then things look pretty pessimistic
at worst surging shale supply could bring a rerun of the downturn from several years ago
