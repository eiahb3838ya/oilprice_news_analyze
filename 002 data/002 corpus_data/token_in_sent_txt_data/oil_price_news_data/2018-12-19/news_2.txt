india finds way to skirt u.s. sanctions against iran
india will use five escrow accounts in iranian banks to pay for deliveries of iranian crude oil amid sanctions bloomberg reports citing sources close to the situation
the accounts are in the name of state indian lender uco payments will be made in indian rupees in a bid to avoid punitive action from washington the sources also said
also the deposits are spread across five banks to reduce risk in case washington decides to add more iranian banks to its sanction we already have iranian bank accounts out of these five have come under secondary sanctions the managing director of uco bank said yesterday
he also said however the other are still good to use for bilateral according to the bloomberg sources will use the money to cover the expenses of its diplomatic missions in india and to buy essential information should not come as a surprise despite the united states efforts to distance india from iran and wean it off its oil
one of the world s top consumers of crude imports almost percent of the oil it guzzles and it is extremely vulnerable to price shocks so iranian crude remains vital for the price of the oil it buys is of the utmost importance iran s favorable credit terms and lower prices are certainly an attractive alternative to a long and difficult process of finding of the commodity
despite higher intake of saudi and oil completely replacing iranian crude has proven more than just recognition of the fact washington granted india along with another seven large iran oil importers a waiver from the sanctions with the caveat these importers were expected to reduce their intake of iranian crude further
