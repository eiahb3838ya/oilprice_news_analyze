shale growth could slow on oil price meltdown
can the shale boom continue if wti stays mired below per barrel much has been made about the dramatic cost reductions that shale drillers have implemented over the past few years with impressive breakeven prices that should ensure the drilling frenzy continues no matter where oil prices go
on earnings calls with investors and analysts shale executives repeatedly trumpeted extremely low breakeven those figures are at times or otherwise misleading
they fail to include the cost of land acquisition and other costs or they simply reflect cost structures in only the very best sudden meltdown in prices oil fell nearly percent on tuesday could put renewed scrutiny on the point at which many shale wells problem for a lot of companies is that they are not necessarily earning the full wti price
oil in west texas in the permian basin continues to trade at a steep discount relative to wti even as the differential has narrowed in recent months
with wti at roughly or per barrel oil based in midland is trading below per barrel the lowest point in more than two years according to nef data provides more clues into the complex breakeven debate
wells located in the spraberry within the permian basin can breakeven when prices trade between and per barrel
digging deeper bloomberg nef notes that some of the best wells can break even in the low but the worst quartile of wells breakeven at an average of per other words a large portion of wells in the permian which to be clear is often held up as the best shale basin in the world is currently unprofitable given wti priced in the per barrel
the problem is even worse for areas outside of the permian where breakevens are on average much higher
arguably only the very best wells in the bakken the eagle ford and the niobrara are making money right puts the heady production figures from the eia for into doubt
the agency expects the to grow production by million barrels per day in another very large annual increase
however that growth is predicated on higher oil prices
if wti remains around current levels us growth should start to slow morgan stanley analysts wrote in a recent are some mitigating circumstances that could shield shale producers from the worst
shale e ps routinely hedge their production for the year ahead
just months ago some of those hedges looked like a bad bet producers had locked in prices in the or so for much of even as oil prices over the summer traded much higher than that
for instance anadarko petroleum said it missed out on million in revenue because it locked itself into hedges at price levels lower than the prevailing spot price
related the race is on big oil rushes to supply the billion disconnectedon the other hand for those that locked in sales for production in say the per barrel might feel pretty good about that right about now
to the extent a shale company has already secured hedging for they may not alter their drilling plans for next year all that for many though is the fact that the industry has held off on some hedging for next year assuming prices could climb even higher
producers have a lower proportion of their next months oil production hedged for this time of year relative to the last few years morgan stanley analysts said in a reason why supply might not actually be severely curtailed despite low prices is that shale companies could simply keep up their pace of drilling in and take on more debt just as they did for so many years
the assumed production growth rate might not change all that much even as balance sheets saudi oil minister crude stocks should drop very soonstandard chartered provides some more insight with a look at the rate of well completions we estimate that completions per month are currently required in the permian to offset declines
the number of permian completions in november was higher than the breakeven completion rate at the investment bank wrote in a note
the number of completions would then have to fall about before permian output stopped growing
while we expect a slowdown in completions if the price of wti in midland texas were to remain close to the current usd we would not expect a fall in completions large enough to halt net finally oil might not be a huge problem if benchmark prices rebound in the relatively near future
saudi oil minister khalid tried to reassure the market this week that we will not see a repeat of the meltdown
we remain focused on fundamentals i can tell you we will achieve balance between supply and demand in he told reporters
there will be enormous pressure on to extend the latest production cuts through the end of the longer low prices stick around the more significant the impact will be on production
if strip prices remain subdued into early at around wti we would expect budgets to be set at levels that reduce the trend rate of growth all else equal which we would expect to become more noticeable by morgan stanley nick cunningham of top reads from
