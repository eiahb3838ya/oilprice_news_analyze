u.s. petroleum imports could fall to zero in 2020
in following years of declining oil production net monthly imports of crude oil and finished products had climbed to more than million barrels per day bpd s happened since is nothing short of amazing
last week the energy information administration eia reported that crude oil production had reached million represents an increase of more than million bpd in the past year and is more than million bpd higher than march production
crude oil demand has fluctuated a bit in recent years but presently stands at just over million bpd which is about the same level as in the million bpd difference between oil demand and oil production one might think that the is still dependent on foreign countries for of our crude oil
but it s more complicated than
refineries have invested billions of dollars into equipment to process heavy sour contains sulfur compounds crudes
most of the new oil production in the is light and sweet which isn t as economically attractive for refiners who have invested in equipment to process the lower grades which are much cheaper the truth behind oil s recent price spikethus oil producers have been exporting an increasing amount of oil while refiners import the cheaper heavy grades
in just the past four years crude oil exports have jumped from nearly nothing to more than million bpd click to enlarge crude oil the also exports finished products like gasoline and diesel
in fact a growing fraction of the oil being consumed in the is simply being refined and exported
in the became a net exporter of finished products diesel gasoline etc
for the first time since
finished product exports have continued to grow since related deal creates biggest player in the permian click to enlarge net finished petroleum product that this graphic reflects the difference between the finished products we import and those we all the factors are considered the impact of growing oil production becomes clear
the overall balance between imports and exports of both crude oil and finished products fell to million bpd in december
that is the lowest level since the eia began tracking this category in click to enlarge net imports of petroleum and petroleum fall the international energy agency declared in its world energy outlook that the could be a net exporter of oil within a decade
on the current trajectory net imports could indeed turn into net exports in is also the last year that the iea projects that supply growth will keep up with demand growth given the present level of global investments
i will address that possibility in the next robert rapiermore top reads from
