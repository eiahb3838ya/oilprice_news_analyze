the struggle continues for bankrupt shale drillers
remember the wave of bankruptcies that hit shale e ps and oilfield services providers in the shale patch between and
over those two years more than oil and gas producers filed for bankruptcy protection in the united states figures from haynes boone showed last then it seems that life has not been much different for many of these s alex nissbaum in a recent story on the fate of those less fortunate drillers noted sandridge energy as the poster boy for oil and gas companies that are still struggling to get back on their feet but may never exited bankruptcy last year but has found it difficult to return to growth mode for a number of reasons that are indicative of the challenges that remain in the shale oil and gas most obvious one is that not all shale is created equal whatever the industry tells us about lowering production costs and improving operational s forget this mantra for a moment
everyone wants in on the permian boom but not everybody wants in on certain parts of oklahoma for one analyst told nissbaum about the survivors the bottom line is a lot of these companies didn t have very good assets to begin with
you can go through bankruptcy and wipe away debt and that s all well and good but the assets they ended up with are still not very attractive
related us oil rig count dips as prices risethe truth about how not all shale is created equal often gets ignored in the flood of upbeat news about well productivity and reserves
but some have been warning about this including art berman and eog s mark papa
not all shale plays are equally easy to exploit
not all acreage within the same play is equally cheap to drill
and ultimately you shouldn t believe everything you hear from the oil inherent inequality in acreage quality is just one of the industry challenges experienced by the struggle that companies recently emerging from is specific to them and it has to do with shareholders
the majority of these companies are now controlled by who don t have the industry background and the dedication it takes to make an oil and gas company successful says nissbaum quoting a haynes boone are not interested in the sustainability of the business
they want to get their money back and this prompts decisions that are not necessarily the best for the s not to say that the bigger healthier oil players in the shale patch are having a good time with their shareholders
not at all they are demanding finally some solid returns on their investment
still that s better than having to deal with hedge funds and distressed debt buyers who want their money back now
related oil majors should invest in deepwater drillingfinally there is the possibility that these companies exited bankruptcy too was grasping for straws after the oil price collapse and at the first sign of improving prices after struck its deal to start curbing production the shale industry started pumping again buying into bullish oil price forecasts and demand thing is according to analysts at least many of those eager to exit bankruptcy did not have the necessary liquidity to see the end of the crisis through and they didn t plan question remains however if the rest of the pack those who didn t have to file for bankruptcy protection did plan sufficiently ahead to ensure their sustainability
or did they simply follow their instinct telling them higher prices more drilling by irina slav for top read from
