u.s. sanctions could be the final nail in the coffin for venezuelan oil
the white house is looking at slapping sanctions on a venezuelan oil services company while also restricting insurance for oil shipments from the south american country among other possible measures according to moves come as the venezuelan president nicolas maduro is planning elections for april which few expect to be free or fair
unlike prior elections the upcoming race will likely be met with global condemnation and many countries could refuse to recognize the results election would be the latest move by president maduro to tighten his grip on the nation having already neutered much of the country s democratic institutions
but because of the nature of an essentially rigged presidential election washington is planning more or when such measures are implemented is still unclear
a official told reuters that the moves could come in waves with some sanctions coming before the election and others after
either way the more aggressive the action the more it will take a bite out of venezuela s oil sector while also likely spreading misery among the venezuelan few options have been on the table
more minor steps would consist of sanctions on individuals within the maduro government although that has already been tried a bit with little effect
a more serious option would be to prohibit the export of light oil and diluents to venezuela fuels that are used to blend in which venezuela s heavy oil

the measures have made it difficult for venezuela to deal with its mountain of debt and many analysts say the financial screws have contributed to the steep declines in oil another option would be to target the insurance of oil tankers carrying venezuelan crude a tactic used against iran several years ago and widely cited as a major reason why iranian oil exports fell
this too would probably severely curtail oil effect on the oil market would be significant

a new report from columbia university which summarizes a december panel event noted that venezuela s production is in a death spiral and that production declines have spread from operations to those of the joint ventures which have held up until foreign operators lost confidence after pdvsa which for years had failed to meet its full budgetary requirements reportedly stopped making all payments into the jvs budgets the report concluded
