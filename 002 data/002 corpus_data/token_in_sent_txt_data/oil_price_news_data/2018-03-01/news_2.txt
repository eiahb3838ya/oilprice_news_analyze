eiaâ€™s shocking u.s. oil production predictions
between and annual oil production in the grew by four million barrels per day bpd
production dipped in but then crude oil production again rose by million bpd between january and december to levels that haven t been seen since the early surge in production is a result of growth in tight oil more commonly known as shale oil
many including myself never imagined that oil production could grow enough to threaten the oil production peak from
but that looks inevitable at this production increase raises the question just how much will tight oil production increase before it peaks and begins to decline
another million bpd
three million bpd the energy information administration s latest annual energy outlook with projections to attempts to answer this question modeling several scenarios for future oil reference case projection assumes that known technologies continue to improve along recent trend lines
the economic and demographic trends that were used reflect the current views of leading the high oil and gas resource and technology case lower costs and a higher resource availability than in the reference case are assumed
in the low oil and gas resource and technology case the assumption is of lower resources and higher are the eia s projections click to enlarge oil production case assumes at least a few more years of tight oil supply growth
the reference case shows oil production growth of two to three million bpd over the next three years before leveling off and remaining at approximately that level until
related investors demand a payday do shale companies agree the low oil resource case projects tight oil growth of another million barrels per day through about and then a steady production decline until high oil resource case projects sharply higher tight oil growth until about and then slower growth until
total production growth in this case was almost nine million barrels per day implying a near doubling of tight oil production between now and risksbut there s one item that barely gets a mention in the eia s annual energy outlook
it is something i witnessed firsthand when i was recently in the permian basin
oil production can expand only as quickly as infrastructure can keep up
and it is struggling to keep s not just crude oil pipelines that are an issue
along with oil comes associated natural gas
in some cases producers have no outlet for this gas so they flare it
but there are various legal limits to flaring
this week i heard about a producer who is having to reduce production because they are bumping up against their permitted limits for addition to potential infrastructure constraints higher oil prices also lead to greater demand for oilfield services providers
that leads to higher costs for the oil producers and higher profits for drilling and fracking services present one of the bottlenecks in the permian basin is with the fracking service providers and that is leading to a growing backlog of wells ducs
this is helping to constrain production in the permian basin but was not a risk identified in the eia s production latest annual energy outlook from the eia models the future potential of tight oil production under several scenarios
some scenarios project tight oil production growth for another three to four years but these scenarios apparently don t consider supply risks posed by insufficient infrastructure oilfield services or manpower
these factors could slow tight oil growth over the next few years and could potentially shift the timing of peak tight robert rapiermore top reads from
