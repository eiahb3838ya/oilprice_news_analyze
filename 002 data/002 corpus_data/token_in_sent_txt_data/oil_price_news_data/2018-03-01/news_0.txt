iran could lose 500,000 bpd if trump trashes deal
declining oil production from venezuela is all but assured this year but another opec member presents another supply risk to the market between the and iran is one of the top geopolitical risks to the oil market this year
a new report from columbia university s center on global energy policy spells out the possible scenarios that could play out later this year as the trump administration steps up its aggressive posture towards trump has begrudgingly waived sanctions on iran multiple times so far as he is required to do every few months as a way of recertifying the nuclear deal officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa
however when he waived the sanctions in january he said it would be the last time he did so unless the nuclear deal was somehow fixed although how specifically that was supposed to be accomplished was problem for the trump administration is that if the president trashes the nuclear deal iran will likely restart its nuclear program as it has already stated
a decision to walk away from the jcpoa absent direct evidence of iranian cheating would be catastrophically unwise richard nephew wrote in the columbia university report
simply put a decision to walk away from the jcpoa would be a reckless unnecessary and counterproductive related mit miracle energy breakthroughnephew argues that it would put iran within a closer reach of a nuclear weapon
pulling out of the deal would also burn bridges with partners in both europe and asia at a time when attention is needed on other pressing matters not the least of which is the brewing crisis on the korean leaving the small matter of utter catastrophe aside what would be the effects on the oil market there are a lot of variables to consider
the way the obama administration succeeded in reducing iranian oil exports several years ago was to threaten sanctions on any foreign bank that did business with iran unless that country reduced oil purchases from iran
it was tricky for some countries that depended on iranian oil such as japan china and india but in the grand scheme of things the managed to significantly curtail iranian oil sales
the government measured this by tracking individual country purchases of iranian oil over a period making sure that the number went such in the event that the trump administration lets the sanctions waivers expire the most likely scenario would be a period in which the would monitor the oil flows from iran ending either in november or perhaps next year if there is an initial delay in implementation
over that time period the pressure would be on countries to reduce their there is a long list of other decisions the trump administration would have to make
there are multiple sanctions that could either be phased in or put in place all at once
on top of that the international reaction would be mostly negative particularly in europe where the uk france and germany were integral to the original european involvement in ratcheting up the pressure on iran will make the campaign decidedly less effective than the first time around
in particular europe was instrumental in tightening the screws on the insurance of oil tankers scaring away oil traders from doing business with iran
that won t be nearly as much of a threat to iran compared to last time

china and russia will likely be even less cooperative and will probably balk at are also tons of technical complications including what constitutes crude oil as well as purchasing contracts that will leave little wiggle room for buyers of iranian oil to turn on a dime
then of course monitoring progress and conveying policy requires quite a bit of manpower from the state department an agency hollowed out by sec
of state rex all of those caveats in mind there are some figures that the columbia university report puts out
if the implemented sanctions only targeting iranian oil purchases it would be reasonable to estimate an initial year reduction of perhaps bpd the report concludes due to lower purchases from japan korea and some european drop off would be closer to bpd if china india or turkey decided to cooperate with the on some level
the effect on oil prices would be to add a few dollars per the efficacy of the campaign could be significantly undercut if china or any other country decides to increase oil purchases from iran as other buyers back out an entirely reasonable scenario
the obama administration was successful only because much of the world cooperated
that is unlikely this time remains to be seen and importantly nobody really knows what will happen
unlike in the international community is largely and remarkably unprepared for a us decision to withdraw from the jcpoa richard nephew writes in the columbia university report
contacts in industry report skepticism with this being a likely us decision and even foreign governments seem to treat the concept as a bluff
