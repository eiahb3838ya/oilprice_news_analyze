new exploration tech finds 1.5 billion barrels of oil in alaska
digital technology adoption in all stages of upstream operations in the oil and gas industry has seen a steep rise recently
while a lot has been written about the benefits of digitizing various aspects of the extraction and field maintenance processes there is also another major field where digital tech is changing the game before the even alaska for instance new technology in oil and gas exploration has led to the discovery of more than billion barrels of crude oil in the north slope in just two years s p global platts recently reported
these are deposits that were known to be there but the resources they held could not be mapped or measured so the deposits were considered unproductive before digital tech in the form of advanced seismic surveys and new data processing techniques came established exploration methods are one area where there is a surge of improvements as seen in the alaska case but there are also alternative exploration techniques emerging around the world
one of these is interestingly enough soil analysis
a dutch company biodentify collects thousands of soil samples to analyze the dna of thousands of microorganisms for traces of hydrocarbons in their environment
the company utilizes machine learning for the task and to calculate the potential reserves of a deposit with according to the company more than percent accuracy
what s more the whole procedure takes between and weeks which is a relatively short time especially in light of the fact that it reduces the risk of drilling unproductive digital technology matures and machine learning techniques advance we ll probably be seeing a lot more different exploration techniques that reduce the risk of spending millions on a well only to find out it s dry
despite last year s international oil price improvements the industry is still being cautious and there are indications it is beginning to like this new normal of leaner and meaner to a significant extent enabled by technology
related oil prices see best january in yearsoil and gas companies even the most resilient and successful among them are keeping their spending under control
true some supermajors have announced larger budgets for this year than last but for the most part the industry is keeping a lid on expenses and trying to get more from every dollar spent than is an environment conducive to a lot of innovation in all stages of the production process
new drilling tech is also helping lower costs and improve results
s p global platts tim bradner notes coiled tubing drilling as an alternative to the multilaterals in horizontal drilling
coiled tubing involves drilling horizontal wells with a flexible tubing bit which is cheaper than drilling with rotary rigs
it could be so cheap in fact that drilling costs per barrel of new oil in already producing fields could be as little as us on the other hand is focusing on developing artificial intelligence to use in drilling among other things
business and tech expert bernard marr wrote recently in a story about his work on data strategy with the supermajor that shell is using reinforcement learning a form of machine learning to improve drilling results and also reduce wear and tear on the equipment which ultimately once again saves costs
the list of examples can continue and it will only become longer in the future
the oil and gas industry has been remarkably fast in adopting what digital technology has to offer and spurring innovation aimed specifically at the note biodentify has not played a role in the above mentioned exploration process that led to the discovery in alaska north slope
