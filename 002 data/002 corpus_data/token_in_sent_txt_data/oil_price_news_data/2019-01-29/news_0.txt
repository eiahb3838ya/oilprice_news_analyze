u.s. seeks to cripple venezuela’s no.1 “vehicle for embezzlement’’
the trump administration stepped up its effort at regime change in venezuela on monday announcing sanctions intended to cripple the country s oil government will bar most transactions between any american companies and pdvsa with some limited exceptions
the treasury department justified the sanctions saying that pdvsa has long been a vehicle for the sanctions immediately put bpd of venezuelan oil exports at risk as well as some bpd of exports of diluents to the subsidiary of venezuela would be allowed to continue to operate but its revenues will be diverted into a designated account
the trump administration is trying to put venezuela s oil revenues into the hands of its preferred president juan threat of oil sanctions on venezuela has been on the table for the better part of two years
former secretary of state rex tillerson repeatedly hinted at the possibility of oil sanctions but the government held off on such a drastic move over fears that it would deepen the humanitarian crisis in venezuela and it would also result in the bearing responsibility for the of those things are now happening
prior american sanctions have arguably made the humanitarian situation much worse and the new round will surely deepen the misery inside the the is actively seeking regime change in venezuela and is no longer trying to hide that fact
if there was any question about american intentions those were put to rest late last week with the appointment of elliott abrams as the special envoy for american policy on venezuela
related what s behind saudi arabia s new downstream strategy abrams is infamous for his involvement in the affair his support for strongmen in central america that engaged in massacres in the as well as his efforts to discredit reports of those killings
in many ways he personifies the very dark period of american foreign policy in latin america in the century
his elevation to lead american policy on venezuela is a little on the nose but to be sure the trump administration no longer has any compunction about broadcasting its desire for regime s national security advisor john bolton was holding a yellow legal pad at a press conference which had troops to colombia scribbled on it
he did not mention that fact and the white house declined to backtrack when asked about it a spokesman responded by saying as the president has said all options are on the in the meantime the sanctions on pdvsa alone are a dramatic escalation in the campaign to oust maduro and they amount to a nuclear bomb franscico monaldi of the baker institute at rice university said in comments to the new york times
however he pointed out that chevron halliburton and schlumberger are going to be allowed to continue to work in venezuela
that suggests that venezuela s oil production may not entirely motivation by the government is to rip venezuela s oil sector out of maduro s hands and place it under the control of juan guiadó
as such the wants venezuela s oil sector to remain alive if on life support

venezuela has been exporting upwards of bpd to american refiners on the gulf coast
any shipments already at sea will be allowed to reach their destination but sales will be barred going forward
pdvsa can seek alternative destinations for its crude such as in india and china but it is going to have to offer some painful discounts to complete sales in those if the sanctions starve the venezuelan government of hard currency maduro and pdvsa may struggle to meet it soaring debt obligations
that could put citgo in the sights of swarming creditors something that maduro clearly sees as a possibility
with this measure they re setting out to steal the citgo company from all venezuelans maduro said at the diplomatic ceremony in caracas
no donald trump
no no the estimates that the sanctions could cost the maduro government around billion in missed revenue over the next year and the new measures also freeze around billion in for the global oil market venezuela is now in danger of suffering steeper supply losses something that treasury secretary stephen mnuchin dismissed as a minor problem
there has been excess oil mnuchin said according to the nyt
