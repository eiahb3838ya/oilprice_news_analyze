can north sea oil stay profitable?
the uk continental shelf in the north sea has recently drawn attention with several significant asset sale deals that have seen chevron reduce its exposure to the legacy production area and small independents gain more ground
now an academic study has estimated there may be between and billion barrels of oil equivalent still to be pumped from the north sea over the next three decades although overall production is set for a steady and alexander kemp and dr linda stephen from the university of aberdeen on request from the oil and gas authority recently completed a study involving economic modeling based on two scenarios featuring crude oil prices at us and us a barrel the favorable effect of lower production costs in the area the authors of the study report the development of these resources would cost a few hundred billion dollars assuming the current tax regime remains in place incentivizing producers to drill for more oil and gas and also assuming platform decommissioning costs of over us billion billion pounds in the period to resources of billion barrels of oil and gas sound like pretty good let s not forget the price and tax the authors also report production will decline steadily
the number of new wells drilled annually in a medium effort scenario is set to fall from in to in and in
in a low effort scenario the number of new wells drilled would decline from in to in and in s worth noting that this decline will occur despite improving technological capabilities that are boosting recovery rates while lowering costs further
there is hardly a chance for anyone exploring the north sea to stumble upon an elephant now
indeed the authors of the study note the current exploration environment is dominated by small undeveloped discoveries that can not generate substantial net present value whatever the investment made

this compares with less than us million million pounds invested in new north sea oil and gas projects in both and the ft s myles mccormick challenges remain
as oilprice reported earlier this month there has been something of an exodus of japanese companies from the uk north sea
while these companies have been replaced by small private independent energy firms it remains unclear whether this replacement could ensure sustainable development of the area s yet untapped resources over the long recent approval by the oil and gas authority of a joint project of bp and shell is certainly big news in this respect after most supermajors including these two shrank their presence in the north sea but chances are such announcements would be few and far between in the long run
after all there is only so much lower than production costs could fall and the future of prices is highly uncertain discouraging risky irina slav for top reads from
