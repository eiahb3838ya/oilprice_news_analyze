is the cushing oil hub still relevant?
crude oil inventories at cushing ticked up slightly to million barrels for the week ending on april but still hovered near lows not seen in several the oil market downturn that began in and lasted through much of inventories at cushing bounced around roughly between and million barrels
cushing s inventory levels have now been slashed by nearly half a sign that the oil market continues to there is more to the story
as reuters points out cushing s importance as an oil hub is rapidly diminishing
while there is of course some oil production in oklahoma cushing s significance has always been larger than a mere storage site
cushing s original importance was as a gathering hub for crude oil streams from all over from various oil fields in different parts of the from imports coming from canada and mexico and from the pipeline crossroads of the world cushing s larger significance was its role as the home of the wti the physical oil upon which wti is based is no longer moving to cushing at least not the way it did in the past
the oil hub is far from the coast where there are refineries and export terminals and it is also rather far from the shale fields in west and south s not just that shale has burst onto the scene in the last few years and shifted the geographical landscape of production
arguably a more crucial factor was the lifting of the crude oil export ban which for decades had trapped oil production within exports are now steadily on the rise
in the last week of march oil exports jumped above million barrels per day up from negligible levels a few years ago and from an average of in although there is great variation from week to week
the revamping of several gulf coast export terminals such as corpus christi and the louisiana offshore oil port loop also have heightened the importance of moving oil to the coast

again that means producers are trying to ship as much of their oil and gas to the gulf coast as everything flowing in the same direction the permian in particular is starting to run into bottlenecks a problem that could yet slow the region s supply growth
several pipelines are in the works and when completed they will solidify an even greater tie between west texas and the gulf coast diminishing cushing s importance
genscape estimates that takeaway capacity from the permian will jump by by the end of next year from to as reuters notes the dakota access pipeline started operations in allowing bakken crude to bypass other words the gulf coast is emerging as a more important oil hub than the one in cushing which will increasingly be cut out of the picture
oil production is even as inventories in cushing are at lows
while cushing stocks currently stand at about million barrels a level of about million barrels is effectively empty according to reuters because a certain amount of oil must be kept on hand to blend with other grades as well as to keep infrastructure working reuters reports some oil traders are clamoring to replace wti as the benchmark for the oil market because wti is derived from supply conditions in cushing
instead a benchmark based on physical oil flows in houston might make more sense
related the oil eating bacteria that can clean up crude spillswti is still one of the world s most traded commodities and it is the basis for a long line of other benchmarks who discount their oil relative to how wti is trading
a switchover to a benchmark would be no small matter
but even if it takes time it might be inevitable
that s the direction it s moving joshua wade a crude oil marketer in oklahoma told reuters
as opposed to importing now you re exporting through the same infrastructure
