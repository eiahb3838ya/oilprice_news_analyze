the sources are the main origins of the flows the key exporting regions such as the middle east latin america and west africa
as for the sinks they are key regions to which these barrels drain continues to be an sink for global crude flows with waterborne discharge in the region clocking in at around million barrels per day
while much has been made of rising crude exports into asia of late other regions in the atlantic basin have shown pockets of strength in the last to asia from the north sea the and west africa averaged just under million barrels per day in up by over a quarter on the prior year of last year strength was to do with the ramp up in the availability of crude egged on by rising domestic production while another piece of the puzzle was the narrowing spread betwixt brent and the benchmark amid the opec production cut making north sea crude a more attractive proposition
a similar trend for helped boost has continued this year with deliveries to asia from the three sources climbing above million barrels per day again in january for only the second time on our records

the olombendo crude stream sees sporadic exports as does sangos while similar to the chart above clov exports are holding up just fine
but as for the older crude streams of medium sweet pazflor and medium sour saturno both have indeed started their descent affirming lower output click to enlarge by matt smithmore top reads from
