record oil production doesnâ€™t free u.s. from global market
in the first week of july net imports of petroleum products fell to just million barrels per day the lowest weekly total on record in at least three decline of net imports comes as the has ramped up oil production in the last few years which affects the net import figure in two ways
surging oil output cuts out the need for imports
also a steady increase in exports also pushes down the net import oil exports hit a high of in the third week of the net import figure has been falling for years and a large part of that is the fact that the has been scaling up exports of refined products including gasoline distillate fuel oil and propane among others
this trend dates back longer than the recent run up in crude weekly net imports peaked routinely topping
now that figure has plunged to less than a zero net import bill in sight is the on the verge of energy independence the long goal that has been promised by just about every president dating back to richard nixon related do crude producers really want higher oil prices not exactly
while the may not need oil and refined product imports in the same way that it used to the is still completely enmeshed and intertwined with the global market
in fact as output of oil and refined products dramatically increased over the past few years the volume of trade also rose sharply
far from reducing interaction with the world higher light tight oil output has contributed to increased traffic as refiners seek to diversify their crude slate and producers look for new markets the iea wrote in its latest oil market report

texas is gushing light oil but refiners along the gulf coast are better equipped to handle medium and heavy grades
that has oil from shale increasingly heading overseas
china for instance has emerged as a major buyer of refiners on the east coast for instance don t have easy access to all of that oil from texas
so they continue to import oil just as gulf coast refiners are processing as much oil as they can and indeed the uptick in domestic oil production has helped fuel a surge in the export of refined products
and as refinery operations have deteriorated in places like mexico and venezuela refined products have found receptive markets in the western top it off demand while not growing at a blistering rate has remain elevated
imports of oil from canada have increased steadily over the past three the us crude oil market is more connected with the rest of the world than at any point in the last years the iea the new oil cartel threatening opecpoliticians have long argued that producing a ton of oil will free americans from their dependence on foreign producers
a look at president trump s twitter feed will quickly demonstrate the hollowness of that claim
even as net imports have plunged the president has been pleading with opec to increase production a perfect example of how the remains at the mercy of the global market regardless of what happens at
oil production continues to break records topping in the last few weeks an high
yet any driver will notice gasoline prices creeping up the national average is hovering around per gallon the highest in of that domestic production only helps insofar as it lowers the global price of crude oil
but there is a lot more going on in the world that determines that price than just what is unfolding in nick cunningham for top reads from
