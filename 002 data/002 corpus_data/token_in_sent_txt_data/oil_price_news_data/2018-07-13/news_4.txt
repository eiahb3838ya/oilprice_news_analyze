iraq set to boost oil output after bai hassan restart
satellite surveillance shows that production has fully resumed at the bai hassan field in iraq
the field is part of a complex of oilfields in northern iraq that were shut down after the kurdistan regional government krg unilaterally voted for independence from baghdad causing iraqi troops to move in on the kirkuk area under its control
while there were reports of the field resuming production at the end of june kayrros satellite surveillance shows it did not achieve normal operations until july disruptions at the bai hassan field accounted for most of the lost barrels in iraq s kirkuk producing region as monitored by kayrros
now that the fields are returning to normal operation that loss which had already been offset by higher output from the south of iraq should drop drastically
the recovery will likely enable baghdad to participate in the supply hike agreed by opec in june offsetting any lost iranian barrels as may result from washington s recent move to leave the nuclear deal between iran and the and reimpose oil sanctions on at the field under krg management averaged in a time when tensions in the region ran particularly high
the kurdish peshmerga forces had to stop the isis insurgency from taking control of the field or setting it ablaze again which hampered production
fighting around the field restricted the flow of oil making it difficult for the krg to maintain pipeline hassan previously produced at a maximum historical value around in before the conflict with isis engulfed the region
the latter s occupation of neighboring syria and parts of northwest iraq created a constant source of struggle for the krg leading to disruptions and reduced productivity
when militants attacked the field in production dropped to only that hassan came back under control of the iraqi government on october when the national army seized the oil fields shortly after the kurdish referendum for dealthe restart of activity coincided with the iraqi prime minister recent announcement that the country would participate in opec s plan to boost output starting in july
the june agreement did not spell out the volume of the production increase speaking only of a return to conformity with the previously agreed ceiling
participating countries had overshot that target by approximately million barrels a day and in media comments the saudi oil minister suggested opec would aim to lift supply by such an amount
related this oil price crash was just a correctioniraq was exempt from its pledge to curtail production under the previous opec deal due to the massive fiscal pressure felt during the war with isis and the looming infrastructure projects that will be required in reconstruction
the recovery at bai hassan should help provide increased revenue make up for lost production in iran and meet the new opec production quota outlined on june were also halted at the neighboring kirkuk avana field before resuming production on march
iraqi and bp officials signed an agreement in january to help boost production from kirkuk area deal will see bp increase the output capacity of the six fields in the kirkuk region to a target of more than million barrels per day overall three times current has been using satellite technology to monitor field production and detect disruptions at and around bai hassan
by tracking production the total output of the field can be contrasted with disruptions to determine the effects of geopolitical events on supply storage and exports which in turn affects global markets
kayrros methods allow for analysis of both historical data and current operations to track the developments in real pipelineiraqi officials also announced that sanctions will not affect the swap early december of last year iraq and iran came to an agreement to ship crude from the kirkuk fields to iran for use in their refineries in exchange for refined products to be delivered by iran at iraq southern deal has proved tricky to implement with several false the negotiations to reopen the pipeline are still adding bai hassan output to the crude to be supplied by iraq to iran under the swap agreement could meet tehran demands that its value be increased by nearly times the current kayrrosmore top reads from
