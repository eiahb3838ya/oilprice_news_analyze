is the oil industry repeating a critical error
ten years ago this to be price of a barrel of oil on the new york mercantile exchange hit an intraday high of its highest price ever
by the following autumn the world economy was in shambles and the price of oil was tumbling
the oil price eventually bottomed out around per barrel in the following prices started at around per barrel and then rose almost continuously until
as they rose the world best known critic of peak prognostications daniel yergin began to look so foolish for having predicted ample supplies for decades to come that his firm finally reversed itself in and began to forecast higher prices
that should have been read as a contrarian signal just two months later the oil bull market oil thinkers at the time believed that their forecast of a nearby peak in the rate of world oil production had been fulfilled
the official numbers seemed to confirm this
petroleum geologist kenneth deffeyes had made a prediction that thanksgiving day would mark the high for production
production of crude oil including lease condensate which is the definition of oil was slightly more than million barrels per day mbpd in december but thereafter high and rising prices oil production failed to exceed that number for two years
in december production inched above the previous high mark and stayed there through july the month the oil price peaked
that month the world produced slightly more than august production fell by more than one million barrels and did not surmount mbpd until two years demand in an era of stagnant supply had sent prices spiraling upward
those high prices became a contributory cause of the worst economic calamity since the great depression
a moment of high drama seemed to coincide with the peak oil moment in world what if peak oil is a process rather than a moment a process with a series of twists and turns filled with sometimes ambiguous and counterintuitive signals
if so it might look something like what the economy rebounded and oil prices rebounded with it the peak oil thesis seemed reconfirmed
the international energy agency had noted in its world energy outlook page that the rate of production of conventional oil had in fact peaked in and that unconventional supplies would thereafter have to provide the world oil supply it turned out world oil production plateaued bouncing between and mbpd until late
not surprisingly this constrained supply brought on high prices
in fact the years through experienced the highest ever average daily prices for crude oil higher than the average for the year of the price fact however was obscured by the fawning media coverage of increasing supplies of shale oil in the united states properly called tight oil which did little to stem the price lonely voice petroleum geologist and consultant art berman pointed out that the companies drilling for this oil were almost all free cash flow as oil prices levitated over per barrel and stayed there
free cash flow is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures
berman said the economics just did support bringing the shale oil out of the ground
but investors did listen and kept handing new investment capital in the form of both equity and debt financing to the drillers
without this capital the drillers would not have been able to continue growing their production since their operating cash flow from existing wells came nowhere near the amount needed to grow we know that berman was right
this fact became more apparent when oil prices declined in and kept going down
several drillers went bust
but even as much of the industry remains on life support those companies currently drilling in the permian basin in texas are involved in yet another bizzare boom
the permian has become a wall street darling even though it actually the latest place where capital goes to countries canada and the united states have been largely responsible for growth in world oil production since
the extra oil came mostly from the tar sands in canada and the tight oil fields of the united states
oil production rose smartly in both countries as long as prices stayed aloft
but the price decline that began in and ended with brent crude at on january caused canadian output to stagnate and production to in both countries has now rebounded with production eclipsing the production peaks of the previous boom
almost all production growth is coming from the permian basin in texas where a drilling frenzy fueled by the flood of new capital mentioned above analysis of the permian details financial conditions that no peak oil thinker could ever have imagined
let take a few moments to see why this is do crude producers really want higher oil prices one of the criticisms of peak oil thinking is that it does take into account economic factors
a second criticism is that it fails to recognize unconventional oil resources such as tar sands tight oil heavy oil and arctic oil
both criticisms are false at least as they apply to the thinkers such as petroleum geologist colin far back as campbell recognized that high oil prices would dampen oil consumption and delay or draw out the peak
but neither he nor other thinkers believed that unconventional oil resources could do anything more than soften the rate of decline in worldwide production
the reason was that such resources would be expensive and difficult to extract and would therefore not enter the market quickly enough to overcome the decline of conventional oil here is what peak oil thinkers could foresee that investors would subsidize the production of vast amounts of oil rather than seeking a return on their capital and that they would do this year after year even in the face of the obvious financial evidence
essentially wall street has been subsidizing the consumption of oil on main this is unsustainable is obvious
eventually investors will realize that there is no value in tight oil
for now the flood of oil from tight oil formations has conjured the illusion that the world need worry about oil supplies anymore because of the miracle of hydraulic fracturing often referred to as fracking
why investors have been cautious about additional investment in the canadian tar sands but not american tight oil is a truly puzzling question
the recent rebound in oil prices should spur some investment elsewhere especially where genuine financial returns await
but the punishing price decline in oil from to and the slow recovery that followed has resulted in deep cuts in exploration and development throughout the industry if not so much in the tight oil fields response the international energy agency has been waving its arms for some time that this dearth of investment will mean constrained supplies after
in addition rystad energy an independent energy research firm reported at the end of last year that saw a record low in oil discoveries
it noted that exploration expenditures had dropped percent from to
without a substantial reversal of this trend the firm expects supply deficits
translation there wo be enough oil to go around in the future
meanwhile writer gail tverberg has been pounding home her counterintuitive thesis that peak world oil production wo be accompanied by high prices
rather it will be the result of prices too low for much of the remaining oil to be extracted profitably
in other words in tverberg opinion there is an oil price that is both low enough to avoid economic stagnation a price that consumers can readily afford and yet high enough to incentivize oil companies to extract sufficient quantities of oil to prevent a decline in the overall rate of production seems the first part of her analysis is proving correct with regard to tight oil production and probably tar sands deepwater and arctic oil
but the fact that tight oil extraction remains by and large free cash flow negative and yet continues to attract investment has obscured her underlying financial the new oil cartel threatening opecinvestors however wo keep subsidizing expensive tight oil extraction for the benefit of the masses indefinitely
as economist herbert stein once said if something ca go on forever it will stop
when it does stop one of three things will emerge the first result seems unlikely as innovation cycles are very long in the oil industry sometimes taking years to reach maturity
the second is possible only in the longer term and only if countries worldwide put themselves on the equivalent of a war footing to speed up their transformation
the third result seems the most probable outcome as the lack of investment in oil exploration is likely to show up in two to three the next oil crisis will mark the peak in worldwide oil production is unknowable
if it does the reprieve provided by what we now know has been tight oil will have been a dangerous that delayed a transition away from oil when the price spike of and the record high prices of the early part of this decade should have made clear that such a transition was urgent
for the uninitiated peak oil in this context refers to the moment in time when the worldwide rate of oil production reaches a peak and thereafter enters a permanent but possibly bumpy decline
it does not as many wrongly claim mean the world will run out of oil
in fact oil will continue to be pumped as long as human society has a need for it and can afford its extraction
the cost of using oil as our main energy source however may be too great for the economy to bear in the long run after the kurt cobb via resource insightsmore top reads from
