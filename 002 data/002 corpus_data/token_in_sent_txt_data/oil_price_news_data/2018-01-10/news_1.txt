the biggest loser of the opec deal
opec s oil production and supply in their second claimed a victim
it s an industry that s vital for the crude oil exports of countries supertanker supertankers or very large crude carriers vlccs are vessels capable of carrying around two million barrels of oil
as opec and its allies work to remove a combined million bpd off the market to draw down the global glut the number of supertankers voyaging from the middle east to asia for example has decreased demand coincides with a period of vessels being delivered and adding to the global supertanker fleet thus creating an excess supply of supertankers at a time when crude oil trade out of the middle east is down
moreover the oil futures market is currently in backwardation the situation in which prices are higher than those for months further in the future which makes hoarding oil in supertankers at sea uneconomical and frees more vessels adding to the overcapacity of the global these factors led to a slump in supertanker average daily earnings in to their lowest since and to below initial analyst to clarkson research the average vlccs earnings dropped to per day in from in a slump
the average earnings were the lowest since at least according to clarkson data cited by bloomberg
just before the production cuts began in january analysts had revised down in december their forecasts for tanker earnings by percent for expecting the worst year since it turned out was the worst year for vlcc earnings since at least the world s most expensive oilprospects for the supertanker market in are also grim especially if opec and allies decide at their june meeting to stick to the production cuts until the end of this year
the cartel and its friends will be reviewing the state of the oil market and might choose to revisit the cuts if they see the market has top of that newly built tankers will continue to add to the global fleet in albeit at a slower pace than in the past two years
clarkson research has estimated that the world s supertanker fleet will grow by percent in following growth in and a increase in if opec lifts the output cut in its revision in june the rates would improve as more oil will be pumped to the market olivier jakob managing director at petromatrix said in an interview for bloomberg
but if it doesn t then the rates would suffer the whole year jakob will continue to suppress any material improvement in the global shipping industry in fitch ratings said in a report last month
the tanker shipping segment is the most exposed following a glut of new vessel deliveries in
we expect demand for tankers to grow by around percent in helped by rising global oil consumption higher exports and declining oil inventories fitch said
but this would still only broadly match the expected growth in tanker supply
rates therefore may not fall further but a sustained increase is unlikely the rating agency added
according to shipping industry association bimco not until we see global oil stocks at a much lower level can we expect a renewed interest in seaborne oil trading activities that will lift oil tanker demand from its current subdued level
however the first half of may pass by before that bimco expects tanker demand growth this year to continue last year s imports in the far east and growing exports from the
this is set to benefit the vlcc market and to some extent suezmax tankers the association said in its preview for the market
