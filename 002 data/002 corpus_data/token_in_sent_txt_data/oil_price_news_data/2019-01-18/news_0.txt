huge backlog could trigger new wave of shale oil
the number of drilled but uncompleted wells ducs in the shale patch has skyrocketed by roughly percent over the past two years
that leaves a rather large backlog that could add a wave of new supply even if the pace of drilling begins to backlog of ducs has continued to swell essentially uninterrupted for more than two years
the total number of ducs hit in november up from a month earlier
that figure is also up sharply from the from the same month in a percent increase
the eia will release new monthly duc data on january which will detail figures for level of ducs is normal but the ballooning number of uncompleted wells has repeatedly fueled speculation that a sudden rush of new supply might come if companies shift those wells into production
the latest crash in oil prices once again raises this calculus on completing wells can cut two ways
on the one hand lower oil prices despite the recent rebound prices are still down sharply from a few months ago can cause some e ps to want to hold off on drilling new wells
that may lead them to decide to complete wells they already drilled as a way of keeping production aloft while husbanding scarce resources
companies that are posting losses may be desperate for revenues so they may accelerate the rate of completions from their duc the flip side producers don t exactly want to bring production online in a market that is subdued
the lower oil price raises some questions about whether you go ahead with completing these wells tom petrie head of oil and gas investment bank petrie partners told s p global platts
some companies want to get them in a producing mode others say they wo get an adequate return right now so they related us oil gas rig count plummets as oil prices surgerob thummel managing director at tortoise capital advisors told s p global platts that companies may have already started to work through some of their duc inventory late last year
he suggests that the explosive production figures in seem higher than last year s rig count justified
a higher rate of completions from wells may explain the higher output the pipeline bottleneck in the permian which to be sure has eased a bit as some additional capacity has come online in recent months could prevent a sudden rush of duc completions
after all the soaring number of ducs was itself at least in part the result of the pipeline handful of new pipelines will add significant new pipeline capacity in the second half of after which more ducs could be completed
last summer pioneer natural resources ceo timothy dove warned in a conference call that oilfield services costs could increase when those pipelines come online because producers may rush to complete ducs all at t hat could be another period of inflationary activity to the point where everyone is trying to get their duc count reduced dove said last august
and so i would say the bigger risk is really past
it really and the prospect of higher completion rates has ramifications for production levels
ducs may keep oil production aloft at a time when low prices are starting to curtail drilling activity
the rig count has been flat for a few months production growth has slowed and growing number of companies are detailing slimmer spending plans this year

as a result of the slide in oil prices over the past three months operators have already started to guide down activity for compared to their initial plans to ramp up activity rystad energy wrote in a recent commentary
consequentially we have lowered our expectations for oil production growth by about bpd for and implying less need for takeaway but completing ducs is fruit
the cost of drilling a well accounts for to percent of the total cost according to s p global platts
as a result companies deciding on whether to bring a duc online has already incurred the drilling costs
a shale company may decide to scale back on new drilling this year because of low prices but the rush of fresh supply from ducs may allow output to continue to grow
of course any decline in new drilling will eventually be felt in the production data but that may not show up until somewhere down the line
more completions from the duc backlog could keep production figures on the this shakes out is anybody s guess but at a minimum the explosion in ducs over the past two years complicates oil production forecasts for this nick cunningham of top reads from
