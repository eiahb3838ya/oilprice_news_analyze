canadian shale is hitting the wall
plunging canadian prices have been depressing oil producers realized prices and revenues even though the benchmark and the international brent crude prices have rallied year to it s not only oil sands producers that have been coping with wide price differentials between canadian crude oil prices and wti this s shale drillers have also started to face widening differentials between the canadian benchmark for light oil delivered at edmonton and wti due pipeline infrastructure to transport the light oil to the edmonton sweet crude discount to wti slumped to us a barrel earlier this widest spread since bloomberg began compiling the data in june that western canadian select wcs benchmark price of oil from canada s oil sands delivered at hardisty been doing any better
the wcs discount to wti has been more than us this year and even us at one point
this resulted in canada natural resources saying in early august that it was allocating capital to lighter oil drilling and is curtailing heavy oil production as the price of canadian heavy oil tumbled to a nearly relative to the benchmark oil prices this year have encouraged more canadian light tight oil and condensate drilling and production but takeaway weakest link of canada s oil maxed and has already started to affect the realized prices of shale drillers similar to the widening discount for midland crude from the permian in the united be sure canadian shale producers are still making money even with a wider discount because wti is now at a barrel analysts tell signs have begun to emerge that a glut has started to pile up as shale and condensate production has been growing when pipeline infrastructure has condensate production in alberta and british columbia has surged from around bpd in early to nearly bpd in march and bpd in may according to bloomberg estimates based on national energy board neb shale and condensate drillers expect that the wider canadian light oil discount to be temporary tom whalen ceo at the petroleum services association of canada told light oil and condensate prices are currently depressed due to the infrastructure constraints analysts see one upside for the canadian oil industry from the wider light oil discounts
related why oil markets can t escape opec russian influencewhile the wide price differential for canada s heavy oil has prevented oil sands producers from taking full advantage of the international and wti oil price increase over the past year low canadian condensate prices is helping their finances a bit because they pay lower prices for the condensate to dilute the bitumen they sands production has created a market for bpd of condensate necessary to dilute the bitumen kevin birn director on the north american crude oil markets team at ihs markit told large part of that condensate currently comes from imports of condensates
according to birn the idea that canadian condensate could overtake imports from the united states wasn t considered in the if it s a battle for market share it s going to come down to imports being pulled back birn said
canadian condensates may end up helping oil sands producers with cheaper domestic diluents but the widened price differential for edmonton light crude highlights the key factor that has plagued canadian oil prices this year and that will likely shape the fate of canada s industry over the next five enough tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
