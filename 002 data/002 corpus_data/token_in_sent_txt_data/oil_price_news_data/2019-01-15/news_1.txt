u.s. ‘tough line’ on iran depends on crude prices
the government is planning on taking a tougher line on iran in the months ahead redoubling its efforts to cut iran s oil exports down to hook the state department s special representative for iran boasted earlier this week about the success in curtailing iran s oil exports to date
in an interview with bloomberg hook noted that when the trump administration withdrew from the iran nuclear deal last may iran was exporting million barrels per day
now he says iran s exports are down near or below in fact in those first six months we took off roughly a million barrels of oil
we did that without increasing the price of oil hook told bloomberg in an there s a lot more to come
we are going to continue our path to get to zero hook said referring to the administration s goal of zeroing out iran s oil exports
however when pressed on when that might happen hook demurred telling bloomberg that the campaign to zero also needs to be balanced against national security and economic s the rub
cutting iran s oil exports to zero was always going to be tricky because it would likely contribute to significant increase in oil prices
in fact the decided in november to issue sanctions waivers to eight countries importing oil from iran precisely because it was worried about the effect on oil time around to be sure there is a lot more room for the trump administration to maneuver
the oil market entered into a state of surplus in the fourth quarter a development that stemmed from the ramp up of supply from opec countries in anticipation of major outages from iran
the surplus could allow the to take a harder line tightening the screws on iran we are not looking to grant any new waivers
that s been our policy from the beginning hook said
we are not looking to grant any exceptions to our campaign of maximum economic he conceded that such an effort to be stingier with waivers is contingent upon oil prices
the granted waivers to japan south korea india china taiwan turkey italy and greece
they expire in may

we believe that we should not comply with the illegal sanctions against iran zanganeh problem for the is that it still hasn t figure out a way to reconcile the twin goals of low oil prices and zero exports from iran
the same puzzle that bedeviled american officials last fall remains
even though the oil market is now that could change in the months arabia having felt a little burned by the trump administration in november helped engineer another round of cuts in december
saudi arabia alone will cut output by around bpd from october levels taking production basically back to where it was before the asked it to increase supply to offset losses from other words the recent oil supply glut seemingly gives the government more leeway to take a harsher line on iran but is already cutting output which will take away some of that make matters more complex the government has sent very mixed signals about its approach to the middle east
a few weeks ago president trump announced a withdrawal of troops from syria and has expressed a desire to reduce american commitments to the region
that was followed by a damage control tour of the middle east by secretary of state mike pompeo and trump s national security adviser john bolton both of which sought to dial back trump s stated goal of troop withdrawal
related fears of shale demise may be overblownmeanwhile the new york times reported that bolton has been itching for a reason to go to war with iran and that his request to draw up military options against iran has raised concerns within the for oil there are also mixed messages
trump s personal desire seems to be low oil prices at all costs
but bolton along with mike pompeo and brian hook all want to ratchet up the pressure on this shakes out remains to be seen but the hawks might feel constrained if the oil market continues to tighten
oil prices are up more than percent from their december lows but are still rather low
if oil remains at current price levels the hawks in the trump administration could have room to if the cuts begin to drain the surplus and oil prices steadily rise over the next four to five months the trump administration may be back to where it was in october feeling a little too skittish about cutting iran s oil exports to zero because of fears over driving oil prices too nick cunningham of top reads from
