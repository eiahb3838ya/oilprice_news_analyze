heavy crude: from glut to shortage
just a few months ago canadian heavy crude oil producers were sending their product to storage amid a painfully deep price discount to west texas intermediate that ate into their margins
chinese refiners took advantage of the cheap canadian crude and stocked up as well while it was cheap
now some are worrying about a shortage of heavy crude that would interfere with the operations of gulf coast refineries that process more than percent of the world s heavy crude reports some heavy crude grades such as heavy louisiana sweet are already trading at a premium to lighter and typically more expensive grades because of this concern which seems like it has further to grow
others are shrinking their discount to brent and december alberta s premier rachel notley ordered a crude oil production cut in the province of bpd to clear up stockpiles and prop up the price of the local benchmark
this worked even before the cuts entered into effect which was at the beginning of this month but it also coincided with opec s latest production cut agreement
more notably it coincided with saudi arabia s early production cut historically when the saudis have cut output it s heavy and medium crude a senior analyst from consultancy turner mason told bloomberg s robert tuttle and sheela toben
this means lower heavy crude production in canada has combined with the consistent decline in venezuelan oil output unlikely to be reversed in the observable future and now with expected lower heavy and medium crude production from saudi arabia
no wonder prices are spiking

asian refiners will suffer from the shortage just as much as their counterparts if it materializes if not more
but it will also present an opportunity for alternative suppliers of heavy crude such as mexican producers if the premium of the usual supplies goes high enough to make these alternative sources of crude competitive
russia is also a large producer of heavy crude and well positioned to up its deliveries to asian analysts expect the rally to be temporary as the refining industry gears up for the new bunkering rules of the international maritime organization it has certainly highlighted canada s pipeline conundrum
there is robust demand for canadian heavy crude from refiners but not enough capacity to transport it across north america to the gulf coast cheaply
the good news for canadian producers is that cheap or not if the refineries need it the refiners will buy news is good for saudi arabia as well as whatever heavy crude it produces will fetch more per barrel than before
venezuela however is in no position to enjoy higher revenues as most of the oil it exports heads for china and russia under agreements signed in the past
mexico would also reap some benefits despite plans by the new government to refine more crude locally than export it these are plans that need refining capacity
in short stakeholders set to benefit from the price rise in heavy crude will likely try to make the best of it while it irina slav for top reads from
