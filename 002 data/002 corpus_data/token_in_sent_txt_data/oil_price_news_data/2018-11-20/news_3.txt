since new pipelines are far from likely to come into operation in the foreseeable future other options are being considered including most recently deliberately cutting production to prop up however are divided on this
while cenovus is all for cuts in production suncor an equally large producer is against we re probably producing about or barrels per day of oil in excess of our ability to get that oil out of the province either by pipelines or by rail cenovus ceo alex pourbaix told canadian media earlier this the other hand our position is that government intervention in the market would send the wrong signals to the investment community regarding doing business in alberta and canada
