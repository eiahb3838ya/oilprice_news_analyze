why aramco abandoned the $40 billion bond sale
saudi aramco has changed its mind about a bond sale of about us billion that would have funded the bigger part of its planned acquisition of a majority stake in local petrochemicals giant sabic
the wall street journal reports that the oil major had been concerned about requirements for disclosure as well as the volatility and uncertain outlook for oil prices according to unnamed sources familiar with the announced plans to acquire up to percent of sabic in a deal expected to be worth about us billion
the seller is the saudi sovereign wealth find the private investment fund
the deal would have expanded aramco s downstream business substantially which would have made it more attractive for potential investors if its initial public offering ever took place which senior officials recently said it us billion turned out to be too hefty a price even for the world s biggest oil company in terms of resources
talk at the time surrounded aramco s plan to use us billion of its own cash and borrow the rest in a combination of various large loans and smaller bridge loans
the loans could be replaced with bond issues after a year or a year and a half several sources told reuters last the public disclosure condition of international bond sales has made aramco think twice
as the wsj reports bond issuing requires disclosure of three years of audited financial results as well as detailing any obstacles that could affect the bond sale
aramco however is notoriously opaque when it comes to financial results and everything else
while its executives have repeatedly made assurances that aramco would start reporting its financial results and disclose information about its operations ahead of the ipo now that this has been postponed until at least the company seems to not see any need to stick to its disclosure pledge
related the impending endgame in oil marketsyet disclosure is not the only factor stopping aramco from tapping international bond markets
the company s only asset is oil and oil has not been doing so well in the past few weeks
in fact over the past month crude oil benchmarks dived down so sharply they lost over a fifth of their value over the period
what must have additionally stung the oil industry in general and aramco in particular was the fact that virtually everyone expected a price rise during that time as sanctions against iran came into effect
instead amid assurances including from saudi arabia that there will be enough oil prices went the other aren t many options left for the acquisition of the percent in sabic
as per a reuters report from october a leveraged buyout was also on the table as aramco discussed strategies with advisers jpmorgan and morgan stanley
the other option is debt
and yet the lack of enthusiasm for bond issuance is likely to have reverberations opening up the saudi bond market was one facet of the sweeping economic reforms that crown prince mohammed has been pursuing over the last couple of s more aramco s unwillingness to disclose financial reports and other information is unlikely to sit well with prospective investors if we assume the ipo is really still an option
this unwillingness after all was one of the main factors that caused a rather lukewarm interest among investors during prince mohammed s roadshow the he undertook to promote the ipo
finally the combination of unwillingness to disclose information and the uncertainty surrounding oil prices might make it harder to borrow
true this is aramco we re talking about and aramco s reputation means a lot for bankers
still after the backlash saudi arabia received after the murder of dissident jamal unthinkable a few years are bankers might have become more cautious when approving loans
