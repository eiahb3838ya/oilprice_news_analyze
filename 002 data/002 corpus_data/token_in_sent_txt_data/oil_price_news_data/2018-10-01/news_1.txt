the oil industry needs large new discoveries, very soon
market participants and analysts are all focused on the imminent oil supply gap that is opening with the sanctions on iran just five weeks beyond the shortest term a larger and more alarming gap in global oil supply is forecast that unless large oil discoveries are made soon the world could be short of oil as early as in the latest such prediction comes from energy consultancy wood mackenzie which sees a supply gap opening up in the middle of the next decade
at the current level of low oil discoveries and barring technology breakthrough beyond woodmac s assumptions that supply gap could soar to million bpd by to million bpd by and to as much as million bpd by s not that discoveries aren t being made they just aren t enough to offset the natural decline at mature fields while global oil demand is still expected to continue to main reason for lower discoveries is that spending on exploration has drastically plunged since the oil price crash
the good news is according to wood mackenzie that the volume of new discoveries is correlated with spending on exploration
so if spend were to increase the chance of more and major oil discoveries gets early as the beginning of this year woodmac said that the share of exploration of upstream investment has slipped to below percent since and is not about to recover
this could be the new normal with the days of one dollar in six or seven going to exploration forever in the past the consultancy said in its things to look for in related refiners struggle to adapt to the shale boomover the past year however exploration seems to have gotten its mojo back woodmac said in june noting that oil discoveries offshore guyana continued to deliver more oil volumes major discoveries were made in the gulf of mexico as well as on the mexican side of the gulf by shell chevron talos and dramatic cut in spending including on exploration has done one good thing to the forced companies to realign strategies and look to do more with less
according to andrew latham vice president global exploration at woodmac this will be the first time in a decade the industry has actually created rather than destroyed on the flip side the oil industry is now finding less oil and gas than it used to latham fact is we need more guyanas a lot more and we need them soon simon flowers chairman and chief analyst at wood mackenzie said in a post last opec secretly discusses bpd production boostthe industry basically needs to replace one north sea each year as the world needs to replace million bpd of supply decline from mature fields while global oil demand continues to grow at a robust pace the international energy agency iea said in its oil report in upstream includes exploration just started to rebound from the lows the iea said in its report on world energy investment in the oil price crash investment plummeted in and from the peaks in but last year s investment rebounded by percent in real terms the iea said expecting the same level of growth this year as are still keeping very tight discipline on capital expenditure and costs and are looking to reward shareholders with fatter dividends now that they are getting more cash from the upstream divisions thanks to the higher oil prices
but the industry as a whole can t afford to neglect spending on exploration because a supply gap may be lurking just around the tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
