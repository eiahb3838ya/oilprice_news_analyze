who will save ukraineâ€™s dying refineries?
ever since war broke out in eastern ukraine the energy industry has been guessing what will happen to ukraine s gas transit and its transmission system
in the background however ukraine s oil sector has remained in tantalizing agony as only one out of the country s six refineries is currently functioning at a utilization rate most of the products supply taken over by neighboring countries and all this with no end in sight
almost every refinery was built with some sort of russian involvement as an owner or crude supplier yet after against the background of unprecedented antagonism between ukraine and russia russian companies have left the country for good
now the question is who will step into the vacant spot
so far it seems that no one is willing refinerynominal capacity mtpacurrent refining status utilization rate at a mere out of ukraine s six oil refineries only one is functioning currently the kremenchug refinery even though at a mere utilization rate
another soviet remnant from the for much of modern ukraine s history it has been under the control of ukrtatnafta initially a joint venture between tatneft and the igor holding privat
following a successful hostile takeover the ownership structure now includes the privat and the ukrainian state a pairing which proved to be contentious to the maximum
ukrainian authorities want to gain full control of the refinery for reasons manifold among others ukraine has to pay russia million for the illegal seizure of kremenchug which happened against the government s will
adding to the piquancy of the situation ukrainian authorities have no idea how much crude exactly does kremenchug actually refine overall we should expect a protracted quarrel until the dust refinerynominal capacity mtpacurrent refining status idle since is in many ways understandable why odessa was chosen as a refinery site back in and why the possibility of the odessa refinery being brought back onstream remains a real one despite a relatively low nelson complexity index of
close to the black sea odessa was lukoil s asset for almost years and it is largely due to the russian major that its refinery slate became significantly lighter
in the hfo took up half of the yield by early it was a quarter of it
however as the stakes rose economic disputes loomed large here too lukoil could not find a modus operandi with the port terminal operator privat port fees artificially high and decided to sell the refinery in to avoid greater damage
lukoil sold it to the vetek energy group hence after the coup the ukrainian state tried to lay its hands on the refinery the legal battle between the two promises to linger for many years to come

before it was sold to in it mostly functioned in a way its fortunes turned to the better afterwards even though the refinery s performance remained to be volatile in terms of profitability
as rosneft swallowed up tnk in the refinery ended up in its hands as it turned out for a brief period
just two years later in the yanukovych coup and the military conflict that followed the russian state giant initiated the lisichansk s modernization only to roll back any financial injections later
given the refinery s substantial damages combined with the current ukrainian authorities stance lisichansk will most likely remain a grim reminder of how sour just things refinerynominal capacity mtpacurrent refining status idle since similarly to drogobich and nadvornaya see below saw no russian involvement hence due to a lack of substantial capital investments is one of the least likely candidates to be brought onstream ever again despite its relatively high nominal refining capacity
after a tumultuous period of ownership in the the refinery has been under the control of the ukrainian business group continuum which has used the refinery as a product storage facility
any modernization initiatives were generally linked to foreign investment not ukrainian funds
two chinese national companies sinopec and later cnpc were alleged to hold negotiations in early over a potential takeover however the talks were largely a market reconnaissance undertaking

as usually with ukrainian idle refineries it requires a significant amount of money to be modernized and brought to a competitive level with a nelson complexity of drogobich can not even produce euro fuels let alone meet quality standards since january has been the standard required by the ukrainian state
the likelihood that any investor will want to renovate drogobich is close to zero realistically it would be much easier to build a new one than to replace all of its units from the sixth refinery nadvornaya traces its foundation to and is in many ways similar to drogobich more or less offline since and being so outdated that it can not produce fuel even compliant with standards its future is remarkably dim
all the more so that when it did refine some oil in the past it refined domestic ukrainian the output of which almost halved to in the last decade
what to do in such a futureless state of things
three russian majors have left in the last ten years either due to political pressures or weak economics and no western major filled their shoes
until the oil sector internal showdown comes to a close it is highly unlikely there will be any to do it
doubly unlikely that russian investors will want to return anytime viktor katona for top reads from
