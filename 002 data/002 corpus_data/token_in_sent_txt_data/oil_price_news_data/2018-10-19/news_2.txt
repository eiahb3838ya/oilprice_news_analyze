oilfield service companies bet on full recovery
growing permian drilling and production started lifting last year the revenues and profits of the world s top oilfield service providers who were badly bruised by the oil price halliburton and baker hughes saw their earnings in the past few quarters lifted by the return of frenzied drilling in north america led by the permian basin while international operations lagged amid slower recovery in global investments in exploration and july this year the mood at schlumberger and baker hughes in earnings was an upbeat outlook for the immediate future with signs that the international market outside the was also on the road to the top oilfield service providers started warning in september that the permian constraints would temporarily slow down activity in the shale for all three of them the international business looks increasingly positive as global spending on exploration and production is beginning to recover rising this the first time since expect all three top oilfield service companies to report higher earnings for the third quarter compared to last year but they have been cutting their projections in recent weeks due to the takeaway capacity constraints in the permian expected to reduce drilling in north america lack of additional pipeline capacity in the permian basin is becoming an increasing constraint to production growth schlumberger chairman and ceo paal kibsgaard said as early as in july on the earnings release
related what killed the oil price rally in september kibsgaard said at the barclays ceo conference that the market consensus that the permian would continue to provide million bpd of annual production growth for the foreseeable future is now starting to be called into in fact so far in the third quarter the hydraulic fracturing market has already softened significantly more than we expected in spite of the overall rig count holding up relatively well schlumberger s head said but added that international e p spending has been picking up pace in the second half of the the same conference in early september jeff miller ceo at the leader on the fracking market halliburton said that in order to overcome takeaway constraints in the permian some operators will capital to other basins some will slowdown other will build as early as in earnings halliburton had warned about a downturn in activity in north america due to budget constraints and takeaway there has been and it s more than we expected miller said last month adding that weakness in pricing in several basins plus project delays in the middle east would impact halliburton s earnings by between to per international markets are recovering and this is where the top three oilfield service providers would look for more drilling and hughes ceo lorenzo simonelli said at the september barclays conference that global e p spending is expected to grow at a healthy pace over the next three to four oil s billion black market we are also seeing the beginnings of a recovery in the international markets
we re expecting offshore activity to see a healthy rebound as well
it will likely remain significantly below peak levels but at the same time we see improving activity and importantly more stability as we look into the next few years simonelli baker hughes and halliburton see the north sea and the middle east as the key growth areas internationally although halliburton s miller warned in july that how much improvement and how quickly it comes will depend in large part upon commodity prices and equipment higher oil prices and lowered development and project costs have led to cautious optimism and measured within the industry that is set to see an uptick in global oil investment this year energy consultants wood mackenzie energy expected in may that new offshore projects are likely to be sanctioned this year compared to just projects in and fewer than in world s top oilfield service providers will be betting on international e p spending recovery while they are waiting for the permian constraints to abate probably sometime at the end of
the current permian takeaway constraints in north america should be addressed within the next to months a series of and challenges is emerging in the us shale basins that could dampen the most optimistic production growth projections schlumberger s ceo said today in its press release on its tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
