oil majors bet big on offshore drilling in 2019
oil majors will spend us billion on offshore drilling and other oilfield services this year but not all sector players are positioned to benefit from the higher spending bloomberg reported last week citing rystad energy s head of oilfield service research audun oilfield service providers unsurprisingly would have a better chance at making the most of the recovery in offshore drilling especially those with expertise in deepwater projects according to martinsen among them technipfmc and subsea in all martinsen told bloomberg that big oil will probably approve about offshore projects this year up from last year and in
that s also slightly more specific than what rystad forecast for offshore oil in a december report
what the forecast suggests is that optimism remains robust despite the oil price drop in the last quarter of to this optimism and relatively high prices there is good news for the oilfield services sector too
the offshore service market is like a super tanker it takes time to accelerate
the uptick in new projects in and now will be enough to turn revenue growth positive to digits as offshore capex is set to increase due to the recent years of capital commitments
and on top of that comes expected increase in operating expenses martinsen said in the december industry itself is cautious about the immediate future
with oil prices trading below there continues to be some uncertainty on e p spending particularly offshore according to the chief executive of a norwegian oilfield surveyor firm tgs nopec geophysical as quoted by bloomberg

one wood mackenzie analyst told bloomberg that despite a moderate increase in demand for drilling vessels this year some percent of deepwater rigs may remain idled this year
that s percentage points down from the number of rigs idled in but still quite a lot of by these expectations and projections the recovery of the oilfield services sector will continue at a rate much slower than the exploration and production industry
companies with greater exposure to the middle east would benefit from the rise in offshore investment there with rystad expecting percent of all new projects to be approved this year to be in this region with another percent in south america and percent in africa and asia combined
the remainder of new offshore projects will be in europe and north america combined rystad chevron and occidental join bill tech companythat should be good news for oilfield service providers focused on the united states but a reuters report from december has suggested they are facing challenges as well
oil producers the report said are still trying to do more with less which has affected negatively oilfield service providers bottom lines despite the stable increase in production
fewer frack crews and fewer rigs are in the plans of several companies for this year what s more they are unwilling to pay more for the crews rigs and other equipment they plan to use this year
and not to put too fine a point on it offshore drilling in the is even slower to recover than trends suggest growing consolidation in a sector already pummeled by the oil price crisis
apparently the recovery we saw a couple of years back when oil prices started climbing and producers chiefly in the united states started boosting production again was temporary or at least irina slav for top reads from
