how supermajors are transforming the permian
the permian basin was once a hotbed of small independent prospectors wildcatters and small companies hoping to strike it rich
now it is brimming with supermajors clamoring to buy out the region s smaller operators and pump out the basin s vast reserves of crude with the kind of breakneck efficiency that only massive corporate backing can achieve
ten years ago in united states oil production bottomed out at about million barrels a day
today million barrels are produced in a day in the permian basin a bit of perspective the entire state of california which recently beat out the united kingdom as the fifth biggest economy in the world has around active drilling rigs
the permian basin alone has nearly
exxon mobil and chevron the united states top energy moguls have both made the permian basin their focus prioritizing their investments in west texas over all their other projects worldwide while european supermajors including royal dutch shell and bp are also working diligently on growing their presence in the of last year exxon mobil based in irving texas became the most active driller in the permian basin with drilling rigs running in the region that extends from west texas to southeastern new mexico
the midland concho resources previously the most active driller in the permian before being surpassed by exxon mobil comes in second with rigs
concho resources significantly expanded their presence in the permian basin last year when they acquired competing company rsp permian for billion
san ramon chevron takes third place in regional drilling activity with more than rigs in the has recently begun ramping up the development of their holdings and now says that their permian basin production spiked a whopping percent in less than a year up to its current level of about barrels of oil equivalent per day
displaying a similar bravado exxon mobil has said it plans to produce more than barrels a day in the permian basin by the year

these high production numbers and huge operations however simply aren t enough to make independent companies competitive in west texas
occidental petroleum and pioneer natural resources are just no match for the corporate companies now throwing their full weight around in the permian basin
even the biggest independent producers simply can t compete with the scale and diversification of an international the crude glut paranoia persists and oil prices remain low supermajors with deep pockets like exxon and chevron can still depend on profits coming from their refining and petrochemical holdings to soften the blow of reduced cash flow in the production sector but independent companies don t have that cushion
as a result many smaller firms are being snapped up by supermajors looking to increase their presence in the permian
endeavor energy is just one company currently on the market and shell exxon mobil and chevron reportedly are among the top bidders eyeing the company for a sale of at least shell only has a modest presence in the area but has expressed a desire for growth and has been increasing production by around percent a year
new shell oil president gretchen watkins was quoted saying the permian is certainly an area of focus for us and one where i can see us expanding over the next little bit with the veritable rush spreading its fever over west texas some reporting has even speculated that the permian could become the most productive oil field in the world
while it was long thought impossible that any field would ever surpass saudi arabia s ghawar oil field the permian is closing that gap in a hurry with no signs of slowing
with a skyrocketing production rate massive and growing drilled but uncompleted duc oil well inventory and what are estimated to be massive untapped resources the permian basin is on track to exceed even the wildest expectations but it s safe to say that independent companies shouldn t expect to be part of that renaissance for haley zaremba for top reads from
