fears of u.s. shale demise may be overblown
recently there has been some concern about the ability of shale and in particular the permian basin to continue the meteoric increases in production that have characterized the past decade in shale production since has led to a scenario no one ever imagined even a few years ago
america is now an energy exporter sending cargoes of oil and lng around the world
click to enlarge source eia chart by authorthe data shows a rapid production ramp from as horizontal drilling and fracking technology replaced vertical wells
this continued and even accelerated through the end of as ducs drilled but uncompleted wells were brought online
the decline of reflects the impact of the oil price drop that actually began in
the new ramp beginning in reflected the new lower costs from suppliers and the effects of the improved well and frac was schlumberger s ceo paal kibsgard who first commented on a decline in productivity that was being observed in completions often called child wells
in their third quarter conference call with analysts he made some remarks that were likely misunderstood by them but subsequently received wide reporting in media perception taken away from these remarks was that kibsgard was saying that it was the quality of the reservoirs that was creating a in child well productivity that could lead to a decline in production down the road
that wasn t what he meant however and in later remarks that were largely skipped over he explained how technology is favorably impacting the results the frackers are seeing it is applied
first here is the quote from that sent everyone into a at present our industry has yet to understand how reservoir conditions and well productivity change as we continue to pump billions of gallons of water and billions of pounds of sand into the ground each year
however what is already clear to us is that unit well performance normalized for lateral length and pounds of proppant pumped is dropping in the eagle ford as the percentage of child wells continues to increase
today the percentage of child wells drilled in the eagle ford has already reached percent and in the period since this percentage broke the percent level we have seen a steady reduction in unit well related venezuela s crisis threatens control over oil prices in the permian the percentage of child wells in the midland wolfcamp basin has just reached percent and we are already starting to see a similar reduction in unit well productivity to that already seen in the eagle ford suggesting that the permian growth potential could be lower than earlier expected
therefore assuming that oil demand will remain robust despite the trade war worries and market concerns around economic weakness in the emerging markets we believe that the level of e p investment must increase both internationally and in north america first of all to counter the multiyear drop in investments and second to develop and deploy the new technologies needed to overcome the emerging shale oil production challenges according to an earnings call changed beginning in let s acknowledge that shale fracking is still a relatively new oil province
as shown in prior to shale regions contributed a minor amount to total production
given that it s only fair to agree the initial period involved some trial and error to see what worked provide some data for analysis and final changes that were made by the majority of the fracking companies were extending the lateral section by percent to where these lengths now routinely run more sand per foot ppf of an interval with current designs calling for as much as ppf
over a foot interval that s a huge volume of sand and closer well spacing
operators have an obvious incentive to avoid well construction costs
spacing the wells closer to each other can accomplish this kibsgard was actually addressing though was that while all of these might be beneficial initially there were problems arising that the application of technology could address
his remarks in response to an analyst question no
i think it can absolutely be solved through technology
a lot of this has to do with the conformity of the frac to make sure that we frac every cluster that we perforate and we have diverse technologies that we have been promoting to the market for several years with some but i think this is likely to accelerate and it s also about how you ensure that your frac stays within the allocated rough volume that you have for the well which is more of a conformance that you are looking for and we have technologies in terms of how we design the frac fluid to address that too
so all of these things i believe are addressable but it requires a bit more of a reservoir focus on how the wells are drilled how the wells are fracked and we need a little bit more data to make sure that we do the right things here
but the measurements are available the analysis and interpretation of the measurements are available and the remedies that we need to do to the frac fluids are also available
it s just a matter of adopting these technologies
we have them all ready to the message kibsgard really meant to convey was that while changes implemented by operators in the previous year were good after all they were making more oil over time there might be a price to pay in lost production
he was saying there was available technology that wasn t being fully deployed to ensure optimal reservoir eurs estimated ultimate recovery
technology that could give the operators a better understanding of the reservoir they were of the direct outcomes of the oil price collapse of the last few years is the ironclad determination of operating companies to tightly rein in costs as has been discussed
this was vital to the resurgence in drilling and completions we saw commence in
but a consequence of this is the difficulty in convincing them that technology is worth paying that of course is the rub
technology has to be paid for initially for it to deliver on its promise of improved results
fortunately it seems many operators are getting the message
click to enlarge sourceone of the big problems that the industry has started to recognize in conjunction with the more aggressive reservoir treatments were frac hits
these effectively cannibalize the production from the parent well by the proximity of the child well
shown in is a modeling example of the closeness of well spacing impairing the integrity of the mentioning also are the needless consumption of scarce resources water and sand that not optimizing well construction entails
wood mackenzie published a study on frac hits recently that was quoted in an article published in desmog closely spaced child well performance presents not only a risk to the viability of the ongoing drilling recovery but also to the industry s prospects
virtually every operator believes child well performance is a material issue but there is no consensus on how to best address the good news oil operators have been regularly improving and beating their own oil production forecasts
in a random survey for this article the recent results of several large shale operators were tallied
all showed consistent and in some cases dramatic quarter over quarter increases in oil other oil companies have been reviewed recently as well including bp chevron and occidental petroleum
all have met or exceeded the production increases of the companies in the chart below
in particular oxy one of the larger permian producers increased oil liftings by percent year over year

what it suggests is that this basin is twice the size of previous estimates with total estimate for hydrocarbons of all forms running as high as billion barrels
click to enlarge summarythis is good news for american shale producers
it shows that rather than entering a period of stagnation and early decline a few years hence due to poor reservoir conditions the industry is just getting its legs under it shows that technology can play an absolute role in maximizing ultimate recoveries from shale wells
this can have a big impact on both lessening our increasing energy dependence on foreign sources and providing a source of export dollars to other are tremendous resources available as the graphic below suggests and it is up to the producers to extract it efficiently and for maximum benefit to the nation
