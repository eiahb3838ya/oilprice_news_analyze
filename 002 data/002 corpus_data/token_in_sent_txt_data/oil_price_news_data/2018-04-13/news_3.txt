pipeline opponents need a shot of common sense
the very word pipeline these days seem to put a lot of people on edge
it has somehow become a synonym of evil
yet pipelines are simply infrastructure for transporting liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons from one place to another
the reason they are necessary is that oil and gas have to go where they are needed by both supporters and opponents of the fossil fuel industry
we all use is now a growing problem with oil and gas pipeline capacity in north america and the solution involves opponents embracing common sense which says that you can not keep it in the ground and have the lights on securely at the same james conca exemplifies the impossibility of eating your cake and having it too with new england
new england is very and anti oil gas and nuclear
it is closing its nuclear plants faster than it is adding renewable capacity and it is paying through the nose for emergency lng cargoes when electricity demand jumps
why
according to conca it s because the states do not want the new pipelines they need and they also doesn t want the additional transmission lines from canada to import more power
as a result the region is suffering you haven t been following the headlines from canada recently the situation is not much different there
a lot of people don t want the trans mountain oil pipeline to be expanded
they don t want any pipelines to be expanded or built
but another group of people finds that this pipeline s expansion is essential for turning canada into a truly international oil s true that canada s heavy oil is dirtier than gas and that transporting it is more expensive than transporting regular crude because it needs to be diluted to a liquid form
but canada needs the international markets as production continues to grow on both sides of the border but demand is not sufficient to absorb all that alberta s producers have to offer
related the invisible sweet spot for big oilwhat pipeline opponents like to point out is the danger of legitimate issue
yet these same people seem unconcerned about the higher spill risks inherent in railway transportation which canadian producers are forced to resort to due to pipeline capacity shortage
if we are talking about statistically calculated risks then these are the lowest with pipelines especially in the age of environmentalism when every pipeline project is the object of very close scrutiny causing pipeline builders to avoid cutting pipeline proponents on the other hand like to point out is that a lot of the pipeline network in north america is of it older than half a century
the older a piece of infrastructure the higher the risk of a breakdown
yet the lobby is against that too for reasons that are not precisely replacement should be easy enough but it is not enbridge s proposal to replace the aging line was met with severe opposition despite the fact that the replacement is supposed to make the pipeline safer
pipeline replacement can certain the need for new infrastructure conca notes
a minor expansion of the diameter of the pipes can increase the flow of oil through them quite a factor of four in would think that people would choose the lesser evil of expanded pipelines to new ones but it appears that opposition is a very supporters want no pipelines period
of course no pipelines at all would mean blackouts and a lot of have yet to fully replace oil and gas and be as somehow this doesn t seem to be a concern
perhaps because it hasn t started happening everywhere and the reason it hasn t started happening is that there are irina slav for top reads from
