is opec’s mission ‘’accomplished’’?
opec s goal of draining the global inventory surplus has finally been international energy agency said in its latest oil market report that the supply overhang has pretty much vanished thanks to opec s efforts at limiting production
it is not for us to declare on behalf of the vienna agreement countries that it is mission accomplished but if our outlook is accurate it certainly looks very much like it the energy agency fundamentals are on a similar track compared to last month s report
the iea kept its oil demand forecast at million barrels per day although it noted that the on trade tariffs between the and china puts the demand outlook at risk
for example a percent decline in global gdp growth would result in a reduction in demand growth by bpd
oil demand would suffer the direct impact of lower bunker consumption and lower inland transportation of traded goods reducing fuel oil and diesel use the iea said
still the negative effects of a trade war remain to be supply picture also looks about the same with growth expected to hit a soaring this year underpinned by a staggering growth rate from the
however the iea said that its supply forecast is also vulnerable to some new potential risks
the pipeline bottleneck emerging in the permian basin could slow the rate of growth of shale supply
t here is concern about bottlenecks in takeaway capacity that have seen recent discounts for wti midland versus houston widen to a record at nearly
this issue applies in canada as well as in the us the iea said

the iea said that taken together some bpd of supply has been sidelined dramatically bolstering the impact of the cuts
to all intents and purposes more than a second saudi arabia has been added to the output agreement the agency declines from venezuela in particular are accentuating the agreement helping to put opec s compliance rate at percent in agreement is succeeding in balancing the oil market
with just under half of global oil supply subject to restraint and oil demand growing steadily the impact on stocks has been substantial the iea inventories have plunged with the surplus in the oecd falling to just million barrels above the average
at the same time refined product stocks are actually below the average
the iea says that if output remains constant and the demand forecast lives up to expectations the market could see inventories decline at a pace for the rest of the data on inventories is not perfect
oecd numbers are published on a lag providing the market only with a retrospective look at the state of play
also the inventory data in the at this point accounts for the bulk of demand growth is notoriously opaque which makes sweeping conclusions about the oil market those caveats in mind the iea said the market rebalancing effort may have arrived
with markets expected to tighten it is possible that when we publish oecd stocks data in the next month or two they will have reached or even fallen below the average related are oil markets tightening too fast against that backdrop the reassertion of geopolitical uncertainty is now heavily influential
as we write uncertainty about the next steps in syria and yemen have helped propel the price of brent crude oil back above even as opec has apparently achieved its goal of draining surplus stocks the group seems set on keeping the cuts in place through the rest of this year
that likely means it will formulate new criteria to justify ongoing cuts
opec is within rapid reach of its first announced goals and will have to come up with a new metric for the june meeting if it wants the agreement to last into the second half of the year olivier jakob of petromatrix told nick cunningham of top reads from
