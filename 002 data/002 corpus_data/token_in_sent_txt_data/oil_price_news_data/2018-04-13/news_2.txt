the biggest hurdle to chinaâ€™s yuan-priced crude benchmark
china finally launched last month its crude oil futures that have been in the works for years after several start of the new contract trading was successful attracting interest from institutional and retail investors and major commodity trading houses glencore and trafigura
yet it s too soon to call the contract a total success because it still faces a long road toward building reputation and history analysts say
they have also identified the single biggest risk factor for western extent to which china could meddle with government regulation in the yuan crude futures as beijing is known for little tolerance toward wild price swings in its markets and has a history of is also the conclusion of china s biggest crude oil supplier opec
in its april monthly oil market report the accounts for close to percent of china s crude oil that the extent to which the ine contract is independent from government interference is currently the main risk factor facing western investors which is in addition to a currency risk given that the ine is settled in according to reuters john kemp possible chinese intervention on the yuan crude future market could be one of the three elements that could doom the new contract
citing the paper why some futures contracts succeed and others fail kemp argues that the third key element to a successful futures policy should not be too adverse to futures be the stumbling block to the chinese crude futures while the new contract could easily meet the other two criteria for success
these are a commercial need for hedging and a pool of speculators must be attracted to a especially its middle eastern producers will be closely watching the futures contract because once established the chinese reference crude price could act as a regional benchmark for negotiations of spot or term crude oil prices
the contract is made up of seven crudes prevalent in the chinese freely traded middle east grades basrah light dubai masila oman qatar marine and upper zakum and china s shengli crude
related will batteries ever become viable at this level of imports from opec middle eastern producing nations will be watching closely as they could in time face pressure from their chinese buyers to adopt this benchmark for pricing their physical crude contracts the cartel said in its monthly fact that opec dedicated a special article on the chinese yuan crude futures in its closely watched report shows that the cartel is taking seriously the possibility that at some point in the future its middle eastern members may have to price the oil they sell to china versus a chinese crude the official goal of the new futures contract is to establish a regional benchmark for more useful pricing of the crude grades prevalent on the chinese market analysts see the yuan oil futures as a step toward china seeking wider acceptance of its currency in global trade including the oil trade and establishing a petroyuan that could challenge in the future the dominance of the is now the biggest crude oil importer in the world and the pace of its oil demand growth is capable of influencing the oil market and the trade in the two most traded crude futures in the world brent and wti
so it makes sense for the top crude importer to want to use oil as a means to promote its own currency on international to dr mohamed ramady an energy economist and geopolitical expert on the gcc the launch of the yuan crude futures contract has two key and pragmatism
on the practical side such a contract would better reflect the crude grades on the chinese market that often differ from the grades underpinning the brent and wti oil prices fall as eia confirms inventory buildon the political front denominating oil contracts in yuan would promote the use of china s currency in global trade one of the country s key goals as an alternative to the dollar making this even more appealing to countries relying on the dollar ramady writes in the yuan is still used in less than percent of global trade but the yuan crude futures contract and china s push to assert its currency internationally could perceptibly change in the near future and create the conditions for a respectable challenge to the us dollar ramady briscoe head of fixed income asia pacific at ubs asset management said in a report just before the chinese futures launched that we believe that in the long term this will change how oil is traded globally create a petroyuan currency flow increase the role of the rmb as a global trading currency and compel investors to up their allocations to chinese financial in the longer term yuan oil trading could shift the structure of the global oil market but two things need to happen first briscoe says
one is that china needs to remove or substantially reduce capital controls
the other is that china s oil suppliers such as saudi arabia russia and iran to agree to accept yuan for their oil exports to china
this is also taking shape because russia already accepts rmb for oil exports as does iran and we expect saudi arabia to soon begin invoicing china in rmb briscoe yuan crude futures launch is as much practicality as it is politics but many analysts and opec itself see chinas domestic capital market policies as the biggest threat to the contract s tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
