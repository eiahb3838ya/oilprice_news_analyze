how significant is wtiâ€™s breakout?
oil after looking rangebound for a while albeit at the highest levels since looks like it has broken out
when wti futures challenged february s high of a few weeks ago we reached before retreating rapidly a pattern that reinforced the resistance level and suggested that we would head lower again
a couple of days ago however we broke through and have been trading above that point for three days now
that confirms that wti has broken out of its range but the lack of follow through since suggests that this may not be all that significant
an analysis of the reasons for the breakout and the price action since however suggest that it will be
click to enlarge the first question that heeds to be answered is how significant any technical signal is in the longer term
the answer is not very
even clearly visible technical analysis such as this can only take you so far
the break of a level often triggers stop loss orders clustered around it so can cause a quick jump that traders can exploit intraday but over time more powerful fundamental forces hold sway
it is those fundamentals that forced oil higher this demand factors that have been in play for nearly a year now are well known
improving global and growth suggest higher oil demand and the market has reacted accordingly
what changed this week however was the supply side of the equation
conventional wisdom has held that that was a restricting factor for oil prices
the seeming ability of north american shale producers to turn production on and off in response to price moves suggested that the run up would prompt big increases in supply
that is still a possibility but what changed this week was the supply picture permian drillers prepare for cost jumpmiddle east tensions and conflicts are nothing new for oil traders nor for anyone else for that matter
they have existed for millennia and the occasional are sometimes taken in stride by the market
the reaction to syria s president assad using chemical weapons against his own people however has the potential to be very are calls for a reaction greater than the targeted strikes employed by president trump last time and that has traders worried
there has been talk from opec this week about extending their production cuts into next year but if the proxy war in syria heats up the prospect of a unified front by the signatories to that agreement are seriously reduced
if the vienna agreement were to break down just as shale producers are ramping up production it doesn t take a genius to conclude that oil will be hit of that however is speculation and if we return to the recent price action there are suggestions that the market is not worried
even as trump has been tweeting out contradictory signals this week and the iea has issued a report that they expect the signatories to the vienna agreement to declare mission accomplished wti has held above the previous highs
that indicates one of two things
either traders are not worried about the effects should that be the case or simply don t believe it will then while technical levels and breakouts are not usually too significant in the long term the lack of volatility following the initial push upwards suggests that this one may be
we are still close enough that a drop back below could come and return us to the previous range but forming a new range of around looks more martin tiller for top reads from
