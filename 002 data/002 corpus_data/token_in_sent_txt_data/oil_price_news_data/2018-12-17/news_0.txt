shale under pressure as oil falls below $50
the cuts still are not doing very much to boost oil prices dashing hopes for many shale producers
with companies in the process of formulating their budgets for the prospect of oil sticking around raises questions about the heady production figures expected from the shale iea expects oil production to grow by million barrels per day in
but oil prices could significantly impact those projections
total shale oil growth is highly sensitive to wti prices in the range morgan stanley wrote in a december note
the investment bank said that shale producers are growing more sensitive to prices below but less sensitive to price spikes above
if wti remains around current levels us growth should start to the investment bank said that larger companies such as conocophillips or occidental petroleum are less sensitive to price swings than smaller e ps
on the other hand some companies could begin to slow production if prices linger at low levels
morgan stanley pointed to apache murphy oil newfield exploration oasis petroleum whiting petroleum and chesapeake energy
with low oil prices we see these companies slowing production growth in to spend within cash flow or minimize outspend free cash flow levels fall or turn negative and leverage metrics move related equinor starts up major gas field in norwegian seaother analysts also see price sensitivity from the shale sector
we expect capex growth on average at wti which should yield production growth of nearly bank of america merrill lynch wrote in a note
however producers may budget for lower oil prices given the recent decline in prices and increase in bofaml went on to add we believe the to price range for wti yields highly variable e ps budgets
in a mid to low wti scenario producer budgets would likely come in flat to lower yoy and would likely lower us production growth to somewhere closer to for next there is one major obstacle that the shale sector faced in that could start to dissipate pipeline
shale producers and pipeline companies have deployed a variety of methods to mitigate the impact of pipeline production figures from shale this year largely come down to the ability of producers and pipeline companies to work around the swelling bottleneck particularly in the permian
pipeline operators have used drag reducing agents to speed up the flow of oil through the lines allowing them to ship more oil than the nameplate capacity suggests
also the plains all american sunrise pipeline came online ahead of schedule which also relieved some congestion
no major outages occurred in which has been an element of luck given the high throughput rates the iea said in its oil market projects are set to come online in which should reduce the pressure on oil producers
the bridgetex and the sunrise expansions will add and bpd in the first half of respectively
another bpd will come from the cactus while enterprise products partners could add bpd by converting a natural gas liquids pipeline to crude oil
related these countries found the most oil in should be close to enough to avoiding production impacts
takeaway capacity growth will therefore closely track output growth in the permian but it will still lag behind until the second half of when the epic project comes online the iea be sure the midstream challenges are not entirely resolve just yet
pipeline congestion at the cushing hub should persist during keeping pressure on wti timespreads and differentials to brent relatively wide bank of america merrill lynch said in a the margin is tight the multiple pipeline projects slated for operation in need to stay on schedule while the midstream sector needs to avoid any unexpected outage
operators can ill afford major pipeline or refinery shutdowns during that time as this would only exacerbate the shortage the iea by the end of there will be very few midstream constraints holding back the shale industry
new planned export terminals will also clear the path for oil to be shipped overseas in ever rising volumes
p ipeline and export projects slated for completion by should unchain north american oil production growth early in the next decade bank of america merrill lynch nick cunningham of top reads from
