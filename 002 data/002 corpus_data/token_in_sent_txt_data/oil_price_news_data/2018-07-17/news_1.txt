is the u.s. overly dependent on russian oil?
at this week s nato meeting in brussels president trump criticized germany s reliance on russian natural gas germany is totally controlled by russia
they will be getting between and percent of their energy from russia and a new president trump s point was that germany s purchases of russian natural gas were making russia richer and that this posed a concern for nato
he later took to twitter to complain what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy pbs news hour argues that the president s numbers are incorrect in any case
the story notes that trump was referring to the nord stream pipeline that is being built between russia and germany but trump s assertion that the pipeline will provide to percent of germany s energy is incorrect
while russia will be able to increase the amount of natural gas it sells to germany through the pipeline russian gas will only provide a sliver of the overall energy germany needs
germany s energy comes from a diverse mix of oil coal and renewables
less than one fifth of the country s power is powered by natural gas at the moment just percent of the country s power is generated by russian this led me to wonder by comparison what percentage of oil imports are being provided by russia
reliance of russian crude oil has fallen since peaking at barrels per day in
however in the still imported barrels per day of crude oil and products from russia click to enlarge total crude oil and products imports from russiaincidentally assuming per barrel for those barrels means the spent about billion on russian oil in

the russian contribution was then about percent of certainly not in the range of germany s reliance on russian natural was the most important supplier of crude oil in
the reliance on foreign crude in was higher for imports from canada percent saudi arabia percent mexico percent venezuela percent and iraq percent opec provided percent of crude oil and finished products in
we are certainly making opec richer with our crude purchases to the tune of about billion last year
