venezuelaâ€™s oil sector may soon have new owners
venezuela s oil production fell by another barrels per day bpd in march a devastating blow that will only make the country s economic crisis worse
output is expected to continue its downward spiral the only uncertainty is over the pace of venezuela comes apart at the seams it will hand over more and more control of its natural resources and even power over its institutions to china according to a new report from the center for strategic international report argues that enormous levels of foreign investment may seem beneficial but that venezuela s economic predicament has actually been made much worse by china
taking advantage of venezuela s desperation china has managed to convince caracas to sign financial agreements that perpetuate the economic malaise afflicting the the past decade china has sent an estimated billion to venezuela in one form or another representing about half of all the money that china has lent to latin america
for years venezuela has been sending oil shipments to china as repayment and last year it shipped roughly bpd to china sales that earned caracas little or no s patience with venezuela seems to have worn thin
reuters reported last month that china is likely to roll over a current financing arrangement it has with venezuela allowing for lenient repayment terms but that it won t lend the venezuelan government any more money than it already has
china remains venezuela s largest debt owner with billion in outstanding csis argues that china remains a key piece of the puzzle propping up president maduro s repressive the think tank says that china s excessive influence is both bad for venezuela and it also raises security concerns
related oil prices poised to rise as cycle comes to an endchina s hunger for commodities has led to dependency essentially preventing venezuela and other countries in latin america from ever developing more sophisticated sectors of the economy
venezuela will remain in a state serving as a place for resource extraction for china s benefit
indeed china s appetite for commodities is only expected to china s loans to venezuela are particularly opaque
csis says that china has often routed its investment in venezuela through hong kong to undisclosed locations
and deals are especially difficult to track
countries that overly dependent on oil exports have historically been prone to corruption but china s effort at obscuring the money trail to venezuela has added yet another layer to the entrenched corruption of the maduro regime csis wrote in its report
the international community should be skeptical of the seemingly endless amounts of untraceable money pouring into a country with a history of corruption narcotrafficking and without checks and that dirty money is then spent on military weapons rather than food and other essentials for the venezuelan people
even as the country crumbles and people go hungry csis says that venezuela ranks in the world in terms of military expenditures and first in latin america
and all that hardware is often put to use against its own the lack of cash has already resulted in debt defaults
csis says that venezuela has not paid a sovereign bond since september and is actually in a state of default on sovereign bonds totaling billion in missed payments
still up until now the totals could be miniscule compared to what might lie ahead in the near future venezuela has more than billion in bond payments coming due in debt default would result in a new stage of suffering for the venezuelan people
it would also leave caracas with fewer options for selling its oil if creditors around the world try to seize oil shipments
this scenario would also likely result in even greater influence for china and russia over venezuela s resources
related oil prices head higher on large crude drawchinese and russian oil companies will probably market a significant share of pdvsa s exports and operate an increasing share of its production guaranteeing the repayment of their loans according to march report from the atlantic council
in other words venezuela will have to more or less hand over its oil to chinese and russian companies if it wants to sell any oil on the international market at there are few good options
the is reportedly considering sanctions although it is unclear when or what form those might take
while there is an urge to do something sanctions would likely only deepen the misery in venezuela with uncertain odds of affecting change
moreover what is clear is that sanctions could knock even more oil production offline significantly raising the odds of default and potentially opening up venezuela to more control by nick cunningham of top reads from
