the clock is ticking: how much oil will iran lose?
those energy analysts who are not yet bored to death with the whole iran business must be having a field day making forecast after forecast about how many barrels the country will lose following next monday s of sanctions
there is a lot of space for speculation and guesswork and even those who are wary of making shocking forecasts don t have a lot of facts to work with
yet it s been six months since president trump announced the sanctions and since then a lot of data has is still coming that the initial shocking forecasts of losses of between and million bpd in iranian exports were slightly compiled by clipperdata and reported by the energy information administration for one thing suggests that iran exported a little less than million bpd in september
that s the same month when there was a flurry of media reports about sharp drops in iranian exports based on conventional tanker tracking suggesting that iran had lost as much as million bpd in outbound shipments
as the clipperdata regular updates based on satellite imaging from this is not the actual japanese and south korean refiners said publicly that they have stopped all iranian oil purchases ahead of the hopes of securing a waiver from the department of and india continued guzzling iranian crude in substantial amounts
china bought about bpd of iranian crude in september clipperdata estimated with india importing bpd
that s down from the average for the first half of the year but not dramatically the average for china was bpd and for india it was yesterday reported almost all iranian oil tankers in the persian gulf have now switched off their geolocation devices and were moving around back and forth between ports to create this basically means the market would have to wait for at least a couple of weeks after november to get any relatively reliable data about how iranian exports are faring amid the sanctions
even so some analysts are once again predicting losses of million meanwhile is preparing
earlier this week media reported that president rouhani had replaced the economic team of the government and that four cargoes of crude were sold on the iranian energy exchange
the amount is not a great one at less than bpd but it could be the start of something regular
related opec radical strategy change after the midtermsthe idea for the exchange is to have private local entities buy the crude and then resell it to foreign traders
analysts accurately point out that this would still put the foreign entities on the hook for penalties from washington as doing business with iranian entities would constitute a breach of the sanctions
yet smugglers would hardly care about iranian sanctions so there is a good chance that illegal entities would make use of this the same time washington is looking into waivers according to a state department spokeswoman who spoke to s p global platts this week
our goal remains to get to zero oil imports from iran as quickly as possible
we are prepared to work with countries that are reducing their imports on a basis
although the two parts of this statement are kind of mutually exclusive chances are even the most hawkish hawks in the trump administration have realized that they do not have complete control over who buys iranian crude and there is such a thing as a black market that iran must be familiar with given its past sanction irina slav for top reads from
