u.s. and opec flood oil market ahead of midterms
opec and the are together adding enormous volumes of new supply which together have softened the oil october opec hiked oil production to the highest level since back before the oil production cuts went into effect according to a recent reuters survey
the higher output led by saudi arabia and the uae come just as iranian oil is going offline
also libya saw a sharp rebound in production although the country is not part of the production countries in opec produced an average million barrels per day in october the highest since december
that was also up bpd from september
oil producers appear to be successfully offsetting the supply outages from iran and venezuela said carsten fritsch of which is not part of opec but part of the coalition continues to produce at record lost bpd in october due to buyers cutting back as sanctions near but the losses were more modest than many analysts had expected
in fact despite the hardline rhetoric from washington the is poised to grant waivers to several countries that are unable to cut their imports of iranian oil to was largely predictable
top importers of iranian oil including india china and turkey could not slash their purchases to zero without incurring a significant economic cost
the pressed these countries but ultimately had to back down
we want to achieve maximum pressure but we don t want to harm friends and allies either national security adviser john bolton said on wednesday
he recognized that some may not be able to go all the way all the way to zero the admission is notable since bolton is widely known as one of the most extreme hardliners when it comes to iran
related cold snap could send natural gas to waivers along with efforts by iran to work around the sanctions regime means that the export losses could plateau
it is doubtful whether iranian oil exports will fall much further from their current level however
after all there are reports that india is to be granted an exemption by the us to buy iranian oil
without such exemptions buyers of iranian oil will risk us sanctions from next monday commerzbank said in a even as opec is boosting production the is also adding supply at an impressive rate
the eia just released production levels for august revealing a massive increase
the agency estimates that the produced a whopping in august an increase of bpd from a month earlier
that level makes the the largest oil producer in the world just a hair above the added compared to august the largest increase over a period on even with opec production at a high and production surging at a torrid pace the oil market is not necessarily on the verge of plunging into a new downturn
despite the flood of new supply the surge does not seem to have overloaded the market according to standard chartered
crude oil inventories have climbed significantly but part of the reason for the increase is that refinery utilization is way down
refineries tend to go into maintenance after the summer but standard chartered said this has been a maintenance that has led to inventory increases but still inventories are right in the middle of the average
that also included a scheduled release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve a volume that was previously legislated by congress

investors have sold off bullish bets on oil futures and the futures curve has flipped from backwardation into contango a sign of increased given these output numbers with russia pumping hard and the united states and opec as well and we are not really seeing a pickup in demand for another month it could indicate we re back to the good old range that persisted through april and august saxo bank senior manager ole hansen said according to kemp of reuters argues that the surge in production this year is the result of the increase in prices in and the early part of this year
enormous production increases tend to come to months after a shift in prices
and because prices have moderated since april the production increases could also level off next year suggesting that the blistering rate of growth seen in probably won t for now the flood of new supply may have put a cap on oil prices in the barring any unforeseen nick cunningham of top reads from
