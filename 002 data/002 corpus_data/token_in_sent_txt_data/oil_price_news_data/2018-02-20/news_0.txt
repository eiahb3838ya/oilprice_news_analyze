frac sand shortage threatens shale boom
higher drilling costs could threaten the recent surge in united states shale production
halliburton said last week that its earnings could be negatively impacted because of bottlenecks related to the supply of frac sand used in shale drilling
the wall street journal reported that halliburton s shares were briefly halted on february after halliburton s cfo chris weber told an audience at the credit suisse energy summit that the company s first quarter earnings could take a hit by a whopping cents per reason he said was because of delays by canadian rail companies that would slow the delivery of frac sand
halliburton saw its shares drop by more than percent on a day that saw broader gains to the s p sand is integral to growing shale production increasingly so these days with more and more sand pumped down into a well
shale drillers have credited the heavy doses of sand with squeezing out more oil and gas from the average well
demand for frac sand surged from million tons in to million tons in
consumption fell in the ensuing years as drilling dried up when oil prices collapsed but frac sand consumption surpassed previous highs in as drilling resoundingly came back
related oil prices diverge on mixed datain frac sand demand is expected to top million tons according to rystad energy
right now the market is really stretched thin says thomas jacob a senior analyst at ihs markit told the ft in december
everyone is running at full much of the frac sand has come from places like wisconsin which produces northern white sand that is hard and round helping to create porous fractures in shale wells
it is high quality but expensive particularly because it has to be shipped by rail to texas shale fields
the ft reported that frac sand could cost per short ton on at the texas well head in essentially triple what it costs at the mine in the northern led to new investment in frac sand mining in texas where brown sand could be produced
the quality was not as good with finer grains but texas brown sand could cost a third less than its northern cousin and it is located much closer to drilling as the mines in texas are still in the process of coming online the shale industry s dependence on far away suppliers continues
and because drilling is ramping up and the average shale driller is using more proppant than ever before sand supplies are feeling the during the fourth quarter we also saw cost inflation in sand and trucking
the price of sand escalated over the last few months of jeff miller halliburton s president and ceo told investors on an earnings call in january
b ut i believe that increasing sand capacity particularly from localized mines combined with our supply chain strategy will reduce the cost throughout he went on to try to reassure investors
now these headwinds were anticipated are transitory and are not a surprise at this point in the cycle miller said
related crude exports hit a major milestonethe effects could wear off as new mines startup close to the action in the permian
we using local sand with a few customers in the permian and i believe this will become an increasing trend as additional capacity is activated
therefore sand cost should go down in as regional sand mines come on line and capacity is increased halliburton s ceo jeff miller said last month
this will not happen overnight but we are working with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we can provide desired profit at a reasonable in the meantime drilling operations could face some obstacles
the wsj reported that evercore isi warned in a research note that customer frustration is rampant given the impact to production
most other pressure pumpers will likely see similar headwinds further hampered by the cold weather texas experienced in canadian national railway said that it halted all new shipments for a week in minnesota and wisconsin during some brutally cold winter weatherit will be a while before the impact on oil production if any becomes clear
