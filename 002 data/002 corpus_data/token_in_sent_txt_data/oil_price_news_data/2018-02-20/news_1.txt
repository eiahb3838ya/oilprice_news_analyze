brazil’s coming oil boom will weigh on oil prices
it has been an appalling few years for brazil s energy patch
weaker oil prices sweeping corruption scandals and the worst economic downturn ever have sharply impacted the nation s oil industry but improvement might finally be in aforementioned factors triggered a steep decline in investment notably from foreign energy majors preventing brazil from fully exploiting its sizable oil reserves of billion key problem is that a large portion of those reserves are held in its offshore oilfields that means they can be complex and costly to fully the potential held by the belt is tremendous
its basins have some of the highest drilling success rates globally and the national petroleum agency the anp believes that if effectively exploited the area could easily double brazil s oil insiders estimate that the largest oil field in the acreage the libra field alone has recoverable oil resources of up to billion barrels
for these reasons during production became a major driver of brazil s growing oil output
and for the first time ever in december it was responsible for over half of the nation s total oil oil production rising by year over year offshore drilling activity and the number of discoveries declined significantly
this occurred due to the of petrobras nyse pbr which was mandated as the sole operator in the belt
after gorging itself on debt and becoming embroiled in a corruption scandal it slashed spending on exploration as well as drilling activities as it focused on shoring up its balance sheet and resolving costly litigation
related why commodity coins are gaining popularityother factors which deterred investment were high operating costs created by local content rules costly logistics and overbearing regulation
these in conjunction with substantially lower oil prices made brazil s fields an unattractive investment for foreign energy companies
by december the volume of active rigs was less than half of what it was two years earlier while the number of development wells completed during was a seventh of what it was in after years of mismanagement there are signs that this is about to change and the world is on the cusp of witnessing the emergence of a latin american petroleum combination of reforms including a formalized bidding process relaxed local content rules and the elimination of petrobras exclusive rights to operate in the area have made it far more appealing for foreign oil companies to invest in brazil s energy sector
this in conjunction with firmer oil prices falling lifting costs and high demand for the commercially appealing light sweet crude produced from the area has stimulated considerable interest among foreign first auction in four years and under the new regulatory regime occurred in october
six of the eight exploratory blocks on offer received bids
more promising many foreign energy majors including statoil nyse sto exxon mobil nyse xom royal dutch shell nyse and bp nyse bp participated
the next auction is slated to occur in march with blocks in the offshore ceará potiguar campos and santos basins and basins of parnaíba and paraná on of the earliest pioneers of investing in brazil s fields chevron nyse cvx which didn t participate in the october auction is considering taking part in march
the energy major previously stated that it intends to ramp up activity in brazil having reached a preliminary agreement with schlumberger nyse slb to drill six wells in the frade field in
related offshore oil is poised for significant growthlet s not forget about petrobras which owns and operates around of all the projects
there are signs that the brazilian energy major is on the cusp of emerging from the maelstrom of crises that swept across the company over the previous two years
this will free it up to focus on boosting its drilling activity and production
petrobras says it intends to invest over billion between and to target production growth through a combination of exploration well development and infrastructure appreciable level of interest as well as investment coming online for the area will drive material increases in oil reserves and production over the coming years
because of their low operating costs the oil fields are extremely appealing to oil companies in an operating environment where brent is trading at less than a is confident that it can produce oil for as low as per barrel from its holdings while the libra field which commenced production in november is estimated to have breakeven costs of a mere per tremendous scale of the potential production increases is highlighted by anp estimates that oil output from the libra field alone will reach million barrels the region measuring km by km and containing three oil basins there is considerable scope for the area s oil output to grow
that means as the acreage is developed brazil s oil production will undergo enormous growth further expanding global oil supplies in a market battling an existing supply that will weigh on oil prices it will be boon for brazil s economy and see it become a major player among smith for top reads from
