iran hints at compromise to raise oil output
iran has suggested it could be open to a compromise on a small rise in opec oil output after earlier rejecting a plan by russia and saudi arabia to increase production in response to consumer concerns over rising oil minister bijan zanganeh on june said cartel members that had cut more than required in recent months could increase output back to higher agreed said that would effectively mean a slight increase from top producers such as saudi arabia which has been cutting more deeply than required under previous policies designed to raise day earlier zanganeh had told reporters upon arrival at organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec headquarters in vienna that i do believe at this meeting we can reach agreement
moscow and riyadh have proposed reversing most of a cut in production that opec and other major producers agreed to in amid recent calls by the united states china and other major countries for relief from rising pump iran has signaled its opposition along with iraq algeria and venezuela three other influential opec members
zanganeh cited recent demands for a production increase from president donald trump as a reason to oppose has created difficulty for the oil market by imposing sanctions on venezuela and iran zanganeh asserted leading to lower production and higher prices
related opec s modest aims won t be enough and now he expects opec to change something for better prices he said
that is not fair
opec is an independent organization not an organization to receive instruction from president trump opec is not part of the department of energy of the united states he crude prices have surged nearly percent to almost a barrel since opec and allies such as russia kazakhstan and mexico agreed to a production cut in late is due to meet on june to review the agreement and plans to meet the next day with russia and other producers that joined the agreement in had said he would leave vienna before talks with russia and other countries were held but participants said on june that efforts were taking place to persuade iran to participate in any mohammad barkindo said on june he was confident there would be a deal during the june oil chief jabar said he hoped there would be agreement when opec met but added that the oil market has not reached the level of stabilization
iran opposition to raising oil output puts it on a collision course with russia which has called for raising production by million barrels a day in a rollback of the production energy minister aleksandr novak said the need for increased output is urgent during the summer when demand for gasoline and oil hits a high point for the year
related goldman expect another bull run in oil oil demand usually grows at the steepest pace in the third quarter we could face a deficit if we do take measures novak said on june
in our view this could lead to market overheating meaning sharply higher said that if opec and its allies decide this week to raise output they could review their decision and it at another planned meeting in arabia a close ally of the united states is particularly under pressure from trump to offset any production decline caused by the reimposition of sanctions on iran in and others have also warned that continuing to limit supply could encourage increased production from shale oil producers in the united states who are not part of the opec agreement and pose outside top reads from
