opec meeting could end without decision
back in when opec met to discuss raising oil production to offset the drop in libya resulting from the civil war saudi arabia s ali called it one of the worst meetings that meeting ended without consensus and this is likely to happen again this week when the cartel meets to discuss another production fault line is between saudi arabia and russia which have both signaled that they are all for a substantial increase in production of up to million bpd and iran iraq libya and algeria to date which would have a problem raising their latest remarks from iran s oil minister are not really encouraging
bijan zanganeh said as quoted by reuters that i don t believe at this meeting we can reach agreement
opec is not the organization to receive instruction from president trump opec is not part of the department of energy of the united the comment refers to president trump s tweets about opec artificially pushing prices higher and reports that he personally asked saudi arabia s government to step in and replace iranian barrels with its own after sanctions kick also said he will be leaving vienna before opec s meeting with russia and the other partners in the cut deal
russia is iran s geopolitical ally but now they are in opposing camps with regard to oil production moves and missing that particular meeting could be a diplomatic move to avoid is the country pushing for the highest increase of million bpd
energy minister alexander novak said oil demand usually grows at the steepest pace in the third quarter we could face a deficit if we don t take measures echoing widely shared analyst expectations of booming oil demand that they have argued was instrumental in the oil price improvement over the last year or as it has been it is not as robust and unyielding as previously believed
when prices climbed closer to us a barrel demand growth began to slow down which for some reason surprised many oil bulls
related goldman expect another bull run in oilthis slowdown in demand growth highlighted the fact that the emerging economies that are the biggest drivers behind global oil demand growth are not ready to pay whatever asking price they are offered
they are rather going to bargain for lower prices which is exactly what india and china did prompting opec to consider an early end to the for the internal fractures within opec it s also worth noting that two of saudi arabia s gulf and also not on board with a quick major production boost
they seem to be leaning more towards a gradual and more modest increase reuters reports citing opec sources
indeed some believe russia s proposal is a tactical move aimed at priming the dissenters for agreement to a more modest or not this move chance seems to be right might soon have a bigger problem to deal with
the congress is deliberating the no oil producing and exporting cartels act allow lawsuits against opec members for manipulating the market
need we say that president trump is an ardent supporter of nopec by irina slav for top reads from
