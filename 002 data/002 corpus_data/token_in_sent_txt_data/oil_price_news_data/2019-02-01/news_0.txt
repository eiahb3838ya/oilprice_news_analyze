canadaâ€™s most crucial pipeline comes under fire
police and private security contractors have been quietly preparing to head off protests of a key oil pipeline in the midwest in an effort to avoid another standing to the intercept minnesota police have been planning for months in case protestors try to block construction of the line pipeline
police and private security contractors have tracked and identified potential protestors and have consulted with law enforcement in north dakota who busted up the standing rock protests
it s not clear why law enforcement is siding with industry or why they are surveilling environmental and indigenous groups but they clearly fear a rerun of the dakota access protests that garnered international attention in line replacement at least to date has not received nearly as much attention as the dakota access pipeline keystone xl or the trans mountain expansion for that matter
but the line replacement is absolutely vital to enbridge its owner and to the canadian oil sands industry as a pipeline runs through ojibwe lands in minnesota
opposition has been strong but so far limited to ojibwe and local environmental groups
but the issue could yet blow up into another standing rock
private security contractors themselves have singled out line as the next likely flashpoint of opposition to a pipeline project according to the good reason
not only would line present a threat to indigenous tribes in minnesota but it is also a critical project to canada s oil industry
alberta and the canadian oil industry have struggled for years to push through a single major pipeline s keystone xl has been in limbo for more than a decade
the company s energy east pipeline which would have run across much of north america from alberta to canada s east coast was scrapped two years ago
related oil rises in best january on recordthe trans mountain expansion was supposed to be the project with the highest odds for completion particularly since it was a twin line along an existing pipeline and not a greenfield project
but that project ran into a brick wall last year when kinder morgan threatened to shelve it only to have the canadian government bailout the company by essentially nationalizing the project
as of now the pipeline s fortunes are still puts incredible importance on line as the salvation for canada s oil sands
because of the pipeline bottlenecks western canada select wcs an oil benchmark that tracks heavy oil from canada suffered enormous price discounts
late last year wcs temporarily traded at a discount to wti which meant that wcs traded as low as per pipelines maxed out and wcs prices crashing the provincial government in alberta instituted mandatory production cuts
just days ago alberta partially lifted the mandatory curtailments because wcs prices have rebounded
a surge in shipments have helped rail shipments were up percent in october compared to a year earlier according to the wall street journal
the crisis in venezuela and the government s efforts at regime change have also pushed up heavy crude prices in rail is costly and ultimately is only a partial and temporary solution
alberta needs a new pipeline if the province is to see its oil industry grow
the line replacement project is a roughly billion overhaul of an aging existing line
replacing the more than pipeline would restore its capacity to bpd
as such it s hard to overstate the importance of the project to canada s oil industry
with energy east dead trans mountain expansion on life support and keystone xl still up in the air the line pipeline is the only significant increase in midstream capacity for the next few years at much of the construction already completed the replacement including construction through minnesota is expected to be completed later this year
it s no wonder that the industry and apparently its allies in law enforcement are desperate to avoid any delays that might crop up from a sudden outburst of nick cunningham of top reads from
