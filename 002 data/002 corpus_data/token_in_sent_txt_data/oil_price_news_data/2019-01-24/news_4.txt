canadian heavy crude producers find new ways to ship oil
when alberta premier rachel notley announced obligatory production cuts of bpd in december in a bid to tackle a deep discount between western canadian select and west texas intermediate the market s reaction was promising
the price of canadian crude jumped up immediately and has been trending higher ever since now that the cuts actually came into effect
but local oil producers are not relaxing they are looking for ways to cut their costs further by reducing transportation expenses and they are employing new technology to do s kevin orland reported earlier this week that meg energy was working on commercializing a proprietary method of partial upgrading that eliminates the need to add diluent to the alberta bitumen so it can be transported by pipeline
the technology as described by orland involves a process that entails removing and recycling some diluent used in its initial processing separating out the lighter and heavier portions of the bitumen then removing solid materials known as meg is not alone in its push
cenovus energy and husky energy are also testing their own methods of reducing diluent demand
they all have a good reason for this
diluents are typically light crude fractions and light fractions are expensive
and that s just the costs are multiple and include the cost of transporting it from its place of origin to where it would be added to the bitumen then stripping it off the bitumen upon arrival at its destination transporting it to a diluent collection hub and from there back to its producer
all these costs really being to burn when you factor in the proportion of bitumen to diluent that makes it possible for the oil to flow through a pipeline
this ratio is bitumen to diluent

for one thing bitumen does not need diluting to be loaded on rail cars and that s some cost savings
for another undiluted bitumen is much harder to spill or leak so from a certain perspective transporting oil by rail might in fact be safer than pipeline transportation
and there is research aimed at enhancing both of these for example a canadian engineer and his team accidentally discovered a way that could make transporting heavy alberta crude by rail much more safely
in fact the bitumen pellets that ian gates and his came up with could make oil transportation safer than method which involves applying heat and pressure to the bitumen turns bitumen into pellets with a highly viscous coating and a liquid core
the process is as costly as adding diluent to the heavy crude however which is probably why it hasn t yet been adopted on a large scale

canadian national argues canapux as it has called its invention can also be transported more cheaply than existing alternatives
it is now looking for financial partners to commercialize a pilot plant with a capacity of bpd of the solid bitumen search for alternatives to diluted bitumen is on but it will probably be a while before we see any meaningful if you look at technology certainly it could have an effect on diluent demand in smaller volumes earlier ihs markit s north american crude oil markets chief kevin birn told orland but to have a really large effect i think you re looking some period out into the future
