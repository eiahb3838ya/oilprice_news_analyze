u.s. set to pump more oil than russia and saudis combined
in a major shift the united states is set to produce more oil and liquids than russia and saudi arabia combined by rystad energy s base case oil price scenario us liquids production is forecast to surpass million barrels per day over the next six years thereby outpacing the combined output from russia and saudi arabia
click to enlarge the united states having regained its position as the world s top liquids producer in is poised to accelerate into a league of its own over the next six years and eclipse the collective output of its two closest rivals by said rystad energy partner artem the us russia and saudi arabia have consistently switched places at the top of the global list of liquid producers measuring crude oil lease condensate and plant natural gas liquids but lately us oil activity and production has built significant momentum
the us has not seen its liquids market share exceed among the big three producing nations since us growth potential could be slowed if oil prices slide below our base case for extended periods but as long as average prices stay above positive us production tendencies will persist abramov added

given the steep production decline rates of shale wells consistently strong annual capital expenditure capex levels are needed in order to deliver on our base production forecast
this corresponds to as much as growth compared to the investment level observed in the us oilpatch in while the billion capex level recorded in is not expected to ever be seen some market participants have voiced concerns about a possible depletion in resources from core parts of major liquids basins in the us
but there are no indications that such a development will occur any time soon abramov noted
