north sea oil has escaped its death spiral
the oil industry is expected to increase spending in the north sea and the number of projects that could receive a greenlight is set to rise this year for the first time in half a estimated to projects are expected to be sanctioned in according to a report from oil gas uk
to put that in context only projects moved forward between and would translate into additional spending of about billion pounds and the production of million barrels of oil equivalent over time
as a result revenues for oilfield service and supply chain companies will rise for the first time in years the report spending and drilling will ultimately mean more oil and gas production from the uk north sea over the next two years although the level of spending and drilling still falls short of the level required to sustain production at current levels oil gas uk while the project landscape for is the healthiest the industry has seen since the industry will still need greater exploration success and will also need to boost production in existing assets in order to avoid decline
for its part standard chartered says that without more gains in spending and the sanctioning of new projects output will once again head into decline after

between and new fields came on stream
this year just four to six new field are expected standard chartered wrote in a note
drilling remains an ongoing concern exploration appraisal and development continue to the bank says that only wells were drilled in the lowest figure since north sea is a mature oil basin that has been suffering from declines for a long time
it is a area with oil fields that have mostly been picked over
still oil companies are greenlighting some new projects and are also returning to older fields with new international energy agency singled out the north sea as one area that has seen a dramatic improvement in the decline rate at existing oil fields
in its oil report the iea said that globally the decline rate at mature oil fields dipped from an average of percent per year between and to just percent in
the unexpected improvement came from a variety of places but the iea singled out the north sea for exhibiting a remarkable deceleration in decline slower decline rates ultimately help the region avoid a decline in absolute terms
while in the north sea the majority of output comes from fields that have already peaked a number of redevelopment projects and efforts to reduce downtime and maximize output have paid off the iea wrote
the agency said that in the norwegian part of the north sea the weighted average decline rate dipped to percent in compared to percent in the early
decline trends in the united kingdom are similar despite a marked slowdown in drilling rates the iea said
related oil prices up as eia confirms crude drawan improvement in the decline rate along with higher levels of drilling and spending could lead to a slight uptick in overall production in the short run
the is another matter
because so many of the fields have been in production for decades and are past their peak output gains are difficult to achieve
higher oil prices would likely be needed if the north sea is to boost production for a longer period of the report from oil gas uk that points to the first increase in fids in several years will be met with relief from the industry
last year royal dutch shell s ceo ben van beurden told the ft that the north sea had escaped the death spiral which had seemed likely just a few years earlier
the decommissioning of older infrastructure would have raised the cost of existing assets ultimately pushing more fields to shut down
that big risk


looks to have been averted van beurden told the ft in nick cunningham of top reads from
