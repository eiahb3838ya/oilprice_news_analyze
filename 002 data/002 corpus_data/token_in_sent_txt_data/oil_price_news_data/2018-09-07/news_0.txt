the downside for oil is limited
more than two weeks of nearly uninterrupted price gains for crude oil ended this week with the rally running out of steam
the question is what happens next oil prices posted steep losses just as the bulls were back on the march
wti briefly topped per barrel in recent days and brent was flirting with
but the rally was kneecapped by a variety of factors and it could be challenging to break above those key pricing thresholds in the near a lthough the timing of the price slide comes as a surprise brent dipped well below for a time on thursday the slide itself does not as expectations recently have doubtless been too optimistic commerzbank wrote in a note
in fact to some the timing was not all that surprising wti faced technical resistance at around and having failed to break above that threshold was forced back beyond the technical analysis oil prices also face some questions on the fundamentals
the emerging market turmoil some say crisis or contagion has not gone away
currency problems continue to dog a long list of emerging market economies pushing a few into or to the brink of fact the msci emerging market index of equities officially fell into bear market territory on thursday and there is little sign of light at the end of the tunnel
my fear of contagion is that right now the sentiment towards the whole spectrum is very fragile mario castro a latin america currency strategist at nomura said in a wall street journal can we expect an oil price spike in november because much of global oil demand growth is concentrated in economies currency weakness could have an outsized impact on crude oil the worries about demand and a possible spillover from emerging markets are weighing on prices hans van cleef senior energy economist at abn amro bank nv told bloomberg

as for the rest of the weekly data it was negative but also unremarkable for late related saudi oil income could reach this yearthe softness in recent days has taken the wind out of the sails of crude oil but it does not mean we are on the verge of another downturn
the news backdrop does not really point to any further price slide according to the doe us crude oil stocks declined by a surprisingly sharp million barrels to million barrels last week their lowest level since february
things also remain interesting with respect to the iran sanctions particularly as far as the situation in india is concerned commerzbank said
we assume that new delhi will bow to the pressure from washington so the supply situation on the oil market will remain with two months to go on iran sanctions exports are falling fast
crude inventories are at their lowest point in years and saudi arabia is going to be forced to burn through much of its spare capacity
