who was buying iranian oil and what happens next?
with trump having started the month process of pulling out from the iranian nuclear deal or rather as steven mnuchin admitted trump true intention is merely renegotiating the existing deal and entering a new agreement the biggest concern among traders and analysts is what impact the trump decision will have on iran oil a reminder some such as barclays have suggested that iran oil production may not be affected at all others such as ubs predict the sanctions could lead to the reduction of oil exports by over the next months
meanwhile deutsche bank notes that because of the wind down period neither iranian oil production nor exports will drop before the november effective date
in fact if behavior follows the example from there is the possibility of a short spike in iranian exports just before the effective date after which a slow decline may set goldman explained this morning the final impact on iran oil will likely be somewhere in between with the ultimate impact on iran production rather negligible for the foreseeable future
the reason for that is that following the announcement other signatories of the deal reiterated their support for the agreement as well as their desire to revisit it
president macron said that france germany and the uk regretted the decision and the eu vowed to uphold the iran nuclear accord
russia announced that the alone would not be able to overturn the deal and its deputy foreign minister said it was willing to support france proposal for new negotiations
at the same time iran announced that it will remain in the nuclear deal and will start talks with european nations china and russia
related oil market volatility set to soar this monthso with the support of the other deal signatories in place goldman damien courvalin writes that the impact on iranian production may be more limited than implied by the us secondary sanctions and certainly less than the decline seen in which many use a benchmark for what happens all as shown in the chart below the bulk of iranian exports is shipped to asian countries most of whom have already said they will continue importing iranian oil while the handful of european nations that received iran crude will likely continue to do so in the future once they request and are granted sanctions waivers

while a specific quantity of reductions that would make buyers eligible for waivers wasn t announced a slew of nations including china india and south korea received japan became the first country to confirm that it will seek a waiver
the nation plans to find out whether its current import volume is enough to get an exception or whether it needs to further reduce purchases bloomberg nations such as china india and turkey will most likely oppose outright the move and keep current levels of iranian crude purchases still some smaller allies including south korea may comply unless they get a waiver over concerns of they could lose a security umbrella against north korea according to mufg and in another deja vu to the last iran sanctions in order to skirt the financial system asian buyers could also resort to using currencies other than the dollar to pay iran for their oil purchases
payments may be routed through either local or foreign banks that don t have close ties to initially paid iran via a turkish bank before routing payments through a domestic financial institution the last time sanctions were in place
the nation along with china also sought to get around the restrictions by trading oil with the persian gulf state for local currencies and goods including wheat soybean meal and consumer eu could seek to protect its entities operating in iran by offering currencies other than the dollar through institutions including the european investment bank mufg s khoman said
indian oil buyers said they can continue to make payments in euros as long as the european union doesn t impose sanctions on the persian gulf the bullish and bearish case for oilas a result of these unknowns and given this uncertain impact on global oil supplies goldman writes that like barclays it has not assumed a loss of iran production in its base case supply forecasts yet and adds the following while we view yesterday decision as introducing upside risks to our brent price forecasts at there remain potential mitigatingour outlook for a tight oil market in could therefore leave the magnitude of the required iran import reductions below the targeted in
medium term we would expect to see a greater shale supply response to high oil prices especially once pipeline bottlenecks in the permian ease said there are clear upside risks to the oil prices among which the hawkish tone of president trump the of all the past secondary sanctions the guidance to begin implementation immediately and finally the high efficiency exhibited by the latest round of us unilateral sanctions on rusal all raise the risk that iranian production declines sharply even despite this foreign course a scenario where as much as in iranian production is taken offline will merely boost production from the likes of saudi arabia which have substantial excess capacity to pick up the slack
some more from goldman importantly it is unlikely that a sharp decline in iranian exports translates into a commensurate decline in global supplies
the us treasury secretary commented that the us has had conversations with various parties that would be willing to increase oil supplies to offset iranian losses
in particular saudi arabia energy ministry issued a statement saying that the country was committed to supporting the stability of the oil market after the us decision to withdraw and that the kingdom would work with major producers and consumers with and outside opec to curb the effects of any supply shortages also helping limit the offsetting beneficial impact of higher oil prices for iran in our view arabia had already boosted its oil output during the last round of sanctions
admittedly there is no guarantee that saudi arabia would deliver a perfect offset to lost iranian volumes especially given its assessment that the rebalancing of the oil market is not yet achieved
and even if saudi arabia did match iran production losses it would simply reduce an already relatively low level of production spare the biggest risk for an upside price spike has little to do with iran and everything to do other potential supply choke points growing geopolitical tension in other key oil producing countries like saudi arabia venezuela libya and nigeria create risks of additional production losses in the face of depleted inventory buffers according to example yesterday also saw a military confrontation between israel syria and iran
the situation in venezuela has already led to a decline in production over the past six months more barrels than presently at risk in iran with no sign of any slowdown in production declines
in fact the seizure of venezuelan assets this week has led to a stall in local top reads from
