the dangers of china’s growing oil demand
china s oil thirst continues to grow despite the impact that tariffs are starting to have on the world s second largest economy
on saturday preliminary data from china s general administration of customs showed that china s crude oil imports rose percent to record high of million in november
a report by commodities data provider s p global platts said it was the first time china monthly crude imports have totaled more than million
the previous record high was million reached in april

oil prices are low so it makes economic sense to store some crude as commercial inventories said the executive who asked not to be scenariogoing forward a scenario for not only china but for global markets particularly emerging markets would be no formal deal reached by march a likely possibility given trump s hard line over china s trade imbalance with the as well as beijing s inability to concede in key areas that negotiators demand
numerous demands are almost impossible for china to agree too at least in the short term since it would force the country to reconfigure how it trades and even how it implements government financial and economic policy
likewise too much acquiescence by xi jinping would weaken his status in the eyes of the chinese populace just as he continues to build his leadership and power to levels not seen since the reign of mao tim daiss for top reads from
