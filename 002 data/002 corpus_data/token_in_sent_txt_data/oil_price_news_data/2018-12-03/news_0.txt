alberta intervenes to halt canada’s oil crisis
oil prices rose on monday buoyed by coordinated production cuts cuts that did not come from vienna although that too could occur later this week the mandatory reductions were handed down by the provincial government of alberta
perhaps opec should therefore consider inviting canada to its meeting on friday commerzbank said in a premier rachel notley announced the production cuts in response to the historically high oil price differential that is costing the national economy more than million per day her office said in a statement
western canada select wcs has plunged below per barrel representing a discount to wti that has hovered at around per the price gap is caused by the federal government s inability to build pipelines
ottawa s failure in this area has left alberta s energy producers with few options to move their products resulting in serious risks for the energy industry and alberta jobs the alberta premier s office s oil industry is producing roughly bpd in excess of available takeaway capacity
the surplus is filling storage up quickly
oil producers will be required to make cuts on the order of percent or bpd beginning in january
once the storage glut is reduced the cuts will narrow to just bpd which will stay in place through the duration of first bpd for each producer will be excluded from the mandatory cuts intended to avoid negatively impacting small producers
the baseline used to calculate the cuts will be the highest level of production for each producer over the past six expects the production cuts to boost prices for wcs by roughly per barrel adding billion to government revenue between and
related why we should worry about low oil pricesthe provincial government went to lengths to describe the measure as temporary and one that will be a benefit to government finances
every albertan owns the energy resources in the ground and we have a duty to defend those resources
but right now they re being sold for pennies on the dollar notley production cuts come just days after notley said that her government was considering paying for increased rail capacity in order to relieve the bottlenecks
that additional rail would add bpd in takeaway capacity but wouldn t be available for another year and would take time to scale s line replacement project is expected to be completed at the end of which will offer the first significant increase in takeaway capacity
however since that is still a rather long time to wait particularly with wcs having dropped close to per barrel the provincial government clearly felt it had to extraordinary intervention into the market was supported by some top canadian oil executives
some producers had already been slightly curtailing output in recent weeks because of painfully low prices but there is a problem that goes into this thinking
any effort to cut output by one company only stands to benefit another
as such some oil executives argued that only government action could provide an orderly way to reduce output to narrow price differentials
related new breakthrough will change how oil reserves are measured while curtailments have been used before by previous governments we believe they should only be used for a short period of time and only in extreme cases said a statement by cenovus ceo alex pourbaix
this is an extreme case
it makes no sense for alberta to stand by while its valuable oil resources sell for next to nothing the provincial treasury loses up to million dollars a day job losses continue to mount and our industry suffers billions of dollars in value the largest impact could come in the first quarter of
the reductions will erase some of the inventory overhang allowing the cuts to be phased out
more rail capacity could ease the midstream burden as well
we interpret the phrasing of the announced cut as keeping production down in and below our prior assessment with the greatest impact on down before new rail capacity gradually comes online from april onward goldman sachs wrote in a s worth noting that years of pipeline fights from environmental groups local communities and first nations are bearing some fruit
the inability to build a major pipeline has put a ceiling on midstream capacity and the bottleneck has swelled over time ultimately leading to the latest announcement from alberta ordering the shutdown of some oil supply
industry groups and pundits scolded protestors declaring that the oil would find its way to the market one way or another
however pipeline delays and logjams are literally keeping oil in the nick cunningham of top reads from
