the unintended consequences of trumpâ€™s solar tariffs
there may not be blood but there will be plenty of losses for those who still hold hope for an age that is passing after the trump administration announced a tariff would be imposed on imports of chinese pv cells and modules the new york times ran a headline declaring this was a threat to solar
what struck me was not that president trump had done so much to harm solar but that the times knew so little about why this action will amount to nothing in the grand scheme of things where the outcome is no longer in doubt that renewables will sweep all contenders even the mightiest fossil fuels from the playing field
a click upon the headline in question produced an improved result the threat level was downgraded to cloudy
well yes there are clouds in springtime even in seattle and london but there are no hurricanes or tornadoes
not so far anyway pump a few more degrees into the oceans and that could change
as for the tariff itself apparently the threat from chinese pv production is slightly less grave than that from washing the same day the most knowledgeable among us signaling from their lofty colorado eyrie pointed out that per watt pv installations were coming around the mountain it didn t say if they would be riding six white horses but let s just assume that s the case
of course they could be gold in which case four should suffice
india is exempt from the tariffs
while we are on the subject of knowledgeable sources consider listening to the greentech media podcast on this matter at the minute mark
while we americans are whining about unfair trade practices which has always been code for those guys are better at this than us and russians interfering in the process that millions of people go through before pulling the lever on the voting machines the chinese and their formidable leader xi jinping are building the next silk road
related texas set for another oil boomthis remarkable undertaking should not be underestimated
in fact it should be closely examined for what it is the path that leads to the chinese assuming that this next inning will only last years and not or
the irony of course is that the trump administration are by default making china great again and much faster than xi jinping probably could have hoped for when he stepped into the top job five years american century began when theodore roosevelt charging up a hill finally kicked the decrepit and broke spanish imperialists out of our backyard or lake rather where they were camped out for years
as the caribbean is to americans and their territorial pride the south china sea is to the reborn and strengthening chinese
it s hard for them to understand what business it is that the americans have here
world war ii ended years ago
ike ended the korean conflict years ago
note that military heroes hate war
would the americans really go to war over taiwan
the romans authors of the source code for the empire called the mediterranean our sea
is roman for middle earth and before the likes of da gama and cook and the coming of satellites it may have been possible to think they got it right
however rome had a somewhat provincial perspective and a better location a name like the indian ocean the wet branch of the new silk road
the indian ocean before the withdrawal of the mings and the coming of the portuguese around africa was always the middle earth sea and the regular and consistent monsoon winds brought trade back and forth across the then civilized world
camels did the heavy lifting across asia
click to enlarge ike was the key driver of the interstate highway system that not only employed millions for a generation building it but also employed those who brought suburbs and shopping malls to the farthest reaches of the new paved network
he got the idea when he crossed the rhine into germany and realized what good wide roads meant for military action and security
hitler wasn t the first to see this after all once upon a time all roads led to rome and good roads meant you could get a legion bristling with roman steel wherever it was needed in a hurry
it was a business model that worked well for over asian highway network that s now being built will do for most of the rest of the world what ike s superhighway did for us
like route that sprang up along the way there will be winners
a very promising one has to be the port of piraeus near athens that is the western terminus of the great road
furthermore from an investment perspective who doesn t hate greece
in other words the news won t get worse there is no one left to convince that it is a terrible place to invest sell and didn t we just bail those guys out realize that the term greek bailout is a bit of a misnomer it was a bank bailout
banks made bad loans
fortunately for them the oldest principal in banking still holds a rolling loan gathers no loss
thanks to the great stan salvigsen for that insight
what will undoubtedly lose at some point after decades of mismanagement and a sobering realization that its keepers don t know the score is the world s reserve currency
it should be clear who s up next and it isn t bitcoin

in case you were asleep and did not hear it the bell has tolled
in fact the recent rise in the price of crude above may have more to do with dollar woes than economic strength though this is always an arguable matter
drillers in the eagle ford don t the noise about russia and bitcoin which more than anything else seems to be a symptom of a world that is rapidly losing faith in paper money and the people and institutions responsible for creating and managing it
bitcoin is not a currency nor a store of value nor a unit of exchange
and until china embraces it which may never happen it will mostly be a fascinating conversation piece and trading mechanism for many who have more dollars than sense
the best thing about financial manias is that they drastically reduce the amount of actual currency before coming to an exhausted rest
you should seriously consider trading your bitcoins for a piece of greece while you can

in his farewell address edited by the great alexander hamilton architect of american financial might he said that an enlightened public was the key to the success and endurance of the american republic
by enlightened he meant educated not buddhist meditation
considering that the new york times itself doesn t yet seem to understand the lay of the land one suspects the ghost of our great father is rattled
rest perturbed spirit the energy wars will be won by the good guys

if you want jobs look no for the currency hamilton the news is not so good
but for solar specifically and those who work in the business the wind still sits fair and it s getting stronger political theater notwithstanding as this impressive chart indicates
