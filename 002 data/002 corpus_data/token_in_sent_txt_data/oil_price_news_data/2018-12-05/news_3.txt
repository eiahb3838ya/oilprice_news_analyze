the u.s. pipeline industry is booming
every once in a while a new technological development shakes up a conservative sector
in the oil and gas industry the shale revolution has changed the business in multiple ways
the has been transformed from one of the world s leading oil importers into the world s largest producer of oil and gas
fracking in the permian basin has created bottlenecks as the existing infrastructure can not cope with rising production
producers are not able to get all the oil and gas to customers creating a price differential with the wti benchmark
on average shale oil producers in the permian basin receive to dollars less for each barrel compared to wti is not only energy companies that are benefitting from rising production pipeline manufacturers are also reaping the rewards
globally the ranks no
in pipelines planned and under construction
most of the oil and gas pipelines planned for and will connect the permian basin with consumers and export terminals in the gulf of mexico
however the additional capacity will create another problem by moving the bottleneck from transportation to the facilities on the and more pipelineswith the need for additional pipelines rising fast texas has become the epicenter of a booming industry
the lone star state produces percent of the national oil production production that the energy department estimates to be million barrels per day
in texas companies are investing billion in building or expanding miles of pipeline which is enough pipeline to reach from west texas to the end of at least three large pipelines will be put into action raising capacity by an additional million barrels per day
however this comes at a time when existing facilities have a limited unused capacity
the added pipeline infrastructure will exceed the available capacity at export facilities by a large margin
several additional facilities have been announced each in a different stadium of planning
however it is likely that not all plans will come to fruition
related opec oil exports jump ahead of meetingaccording to james teague ceo of enterprise products anyone can build a terminal but it what behind that terminal that determines its success
in other words success in the terminal business is as much about securing the barrels as it is about shipping them out
some companies have an edge due to two reasons early planning such as trafigura or those with interests in production transportation and the terminals itself such enbridge successtrafigura is to date the only company that has submitted a formal permit application to build a terminal in the corpus christi area
being the first to complete a facility would diminish the necessity of additional terminals as these facilities don t come cheap costing in the range of billions
however being the first to apply doesn t determine whether you re also the first to finish the facility as environmentalists are trying to delay the rate of success is also determined by supplies and the designated route of pipelines
the majority of export infrastructure is located in two regions houston and corpus christi
companies in these areas are battling to become the country s largest and most important location for moving american oil overseas
each region shipped out more than billion in crude during the first nine months of this year compared to just one billion two years ago
related gazprom s next big bet on european gas marketsfinally a wild card for investors is the additional rise of shale oil production in the coming years
this could determine the construction of additional infrastructure to be commissioned in trade war trucethe recent decision of the and china to halt all hostilities for days is good news for the global economy and especially good news for the american oil and gas industry
first the trade war negatively affected the global economy which in turn reduced the growing demand for oil
the positive news coming from the sidelines of the summit in buenos aires has improved the outlook for global energy demand at least for the construction of pipelines and export facilities requires buyers to make investments profitable
china is the largest growth market for oil and gas
beijing could agree to buy more american energy to reduce the trade deficit
however the truce of the summit is not a peace agreement
therefore american energy companies could be facing a bumpy year in vanand meliksetian for top reads from
