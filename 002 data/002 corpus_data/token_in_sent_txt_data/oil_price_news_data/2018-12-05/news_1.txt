u.s. shale struggles as oil prices drop
the explosive production growth in the shale patch has surprised even the most optimistic forecasters but the huge jumps in output belies and obscures the financial state of the industry which is a bit more complicated than the production figures might companies scrambled to cut costs during the oil market downturn between and and they successfully lowered their breakeven prices significantly
when agreed on its initial production cut deal which started at the beginning of the higher prices that resulted from the agreement allowed shale to rebound in a big way
surging production over the past two years suggested that the shale industry was stronger than year was supposed to be the year that the money started rolling in with cost cuts in hand and higher oil prices lifting all boats shale drillers were supposed to be in the clear
but profits have been be sure some companies have posted significant earnings
the oil majors in particular are earning more money than they have in a long time
but the bulk of the shale industry is still struggling
according to the wall street journal the largest shale companies earned a rather marginal billion combined in latest meltdown in prices however puts a lot in the industry right back into hot water

but often those figures didn t include the cost of land acquisition or transportation
or while individual wells might make a return the company was ignoring the cost of producing in other less desirable locations

the recent downturn in prices is hurting drillers which comes at a time when budgets are mostly exhausted we are seeing a significantly larger drop in activity than we expected which is leading to a larger drop in pricing than we anticipated patrick schorn executive vice president at schlumberger said in an investor presentation according to bloomberg
we continue to see the weakening of the hydraulic fracturing market as temporary with the expectation of a gradual recovery taking place over the first half of the financial strain may also be a hiccup that the industry can overcome
wall street has showered drillers with cash over the past decade or so
the interest rate environment allowed for a drilling boom
in other words unprofitable production barely slowed down the industry in years past
