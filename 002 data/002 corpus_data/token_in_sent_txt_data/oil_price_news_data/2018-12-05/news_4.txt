iran: donâ€™t count on a new opec deal
opec s meeting this thursday in vienna may not lead to an agreement to start reducing production iran s opec governor said as quoted by s p global platts
hossein kazempour ardebili said there were tensions between members of the cartel with some unhappy about others large production increases in recent months
the cooperation agreement is unlikely to be renewed ardebili said
at least some member states will not join it in which case any renewal will be out of the question
increasing the heat further the official said some opec members might even decide to follow in qatar s footsteps and leave opec reason according to ardebili is their limited production capacity especially spare capacity
some producers have limited production capacity
therefore they may be faced with lower demand for production while on the other hand they lack any spare capacity for increased production if need be he said adding that strengthens the possibility of exit by minor member states
that is not impossible
qatar which produces around bpd announced its decision to leave opec earlier this week citing a focus on natural gas and maintaining its position as gas exporter in the cartel is meeting tomorrow to discuss production cuts that may range from to million bpd
russia and another nine will join the talks
there have been reports citing moscow officials that while last time russia did not mind its cut quota which stood at bpd out of total cuts of million bpd this time the country may not be so willing to cut so we think million bpd cuts is more realistic not million bpd
but who is going to do this is another question the source said as quoted by irina slav for top reads from
