eia inventory report pushes oil prices lower
the energy information administration reported a crude oil inventory build of million barrels for the week to february versus an increase of million barrels in the previous week pushing prices crude and west texas intermediate have been trending higher today as news reports strengthen hopes the opec cuts will do their job and boost prices
the latest here was a visit by a special saudi arabian envoy to nigeria which had been straying from the production cut path instead increasing its crude oil production
after the visit however nigeria s president pledged a production production data from the eia failed to reverse the optimism the authority forecast that shale oil production will hit a record million bpd largely on the back of strong production growth in the permian
production in the permian is set to rise above million bpd for the first time in history next month the energy information administration said in the latest release of its drilling productivity gasoline inventories in the world s largest consumer of oil and oil products fell by million barrels last week versus a rise a week earlier
in distillate fuels the eia reported a decline as well compared with a inventory rise a week last week processed million barrels of crude daily compared with million bpd a week earlier producing million bpd of gasoline and million bpd of distillate fuels
a week before that refineries in the churned out million bpd of gasoline and million bpd of distillate the time of writing brent crude was trading at us a barrel and west texas intermediate was changing hands for us a barrel slightly down from opening today and eia s figures are bound to cause something more than a lukewarm reaction in markets
