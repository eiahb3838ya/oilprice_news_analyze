cracks begin to form in saudi-russian alliance
could cracks be forming in the bromance between saudi arabia and russia over oil production quotas
according to one analyst the answer could be yes
the background for one of the biggest structural changes in global markets in recent history dates back only a few years when opec defacto leader saudi arabia mismanaged its role as global oil markets swing producer and actually ramped up production in late in response to a then saturated oil saudi thinking at the time was straight forward
since us shale oil producers had caused the supply overhang and since shale oil producers at the time had a relatively high oil production point the saudis would simply turn on the oil production spigots to flood markets even more driving prices down to points below shale producers points thus driving them out of business
though the saudis have always denied this line of reasoning it s apparent from their actions at the time that this was their agenda as well as jealously protecting oil market share especially in europe and that plan backfired and with oecd oil inventory levels spiking with the next year plus prices dipped below the per barrel price point by january
in response riyadh had to not only backpedal it also had to seek help outside of opec and turn to members particularly russia to forge the first deal to return markets to a semblance of equilibrium and support forward just a few years and the second deal was reached in december and implemented in january for a period of six months with a review period to be held in april
however this time russia is reportedly not trimming production per terms of the new deal leaving most of the heavy lifting to saudi arabia

in response russian energy minster alexander novak who reportedly is on smart phone speed dial list responded in kind
in early february novak said russia was completely fulfilling its obligations in line with earlier announced plans to gradually cut production by may this year
the numbers don t liehowever the numbers come down against russia s claims that it is shouldering its part of the new deal
per terms of the deal members agreed to cut supply by million barrels per day bpd
saudi arabia agreed to make up for most of the cut among opec members and has also confirmed it will drop its crude oil production by a further bpd to million bpd in march
if that output cut is reached it would mean that since december one month before implementation of the deal saudi arabia has become responsible for percent of the total for its part was supposed to account for the greater share of cuts but from october to the beginning of february had only decreased output by bpd

in a note tuesday he wrote that any end to coordination would likely add significant downward pressure on prices
although our base case is still that riyadh and moscow find a compromise to extend the agreement the pact is now looking more fragile than ever said soltvedt
he added that to save the pact he expected saudi arabia may even have to settle for low levels of russian compliance to save the pact
going forwardhowever going forward the biggest risk is not the still freshly minted bromance between russian president vladimir putin and saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman but for global oil markets
if the group unravels and russia once again turns in the oil production spigots it would force saudi arabia into a weakened state similar to where it was in early when it had to turn to members and russia for help soaking up oil supply overhang
this dynamic along with oil production which is poised to pass a once imaginable million bpd would not only inflate global oil inventory levels but with significant downward pressure on prices both brent and west texas a deterioration of cooperation in oil markets would also impact the two sides geopolitical interests especially since riyadh and moscow are on opposite sides in the ongoing syrian civil war and more importantly on opposite sides in how to deal with iran s regional hegemony ambitions as well as it ballistic missile and nuclear development tim daiss for top reads from
