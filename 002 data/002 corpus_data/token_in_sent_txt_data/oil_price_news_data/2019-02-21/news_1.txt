european oil demand is shockingly weak
one of the unexpectedly soft spots in global oil demand recently has been in be sure europe was never expected to be a major driver of oil demand growth
consumption has been mostly flat for a long time
however demand has actually declined in the past few months which suggests a slowdown in the european glaringly demand in germany has fallen significantly
according to standard chartered demand in germany fell by bpd in december compared to a year earlier
that was the tenth consecutive month of an annual decline in consumption in excess of november germany seemed to be the only source of fragility
but in december the weakness popped up in many more european countries
according to standard chartered in december declines in consumption were reported in overall in oecd europe demand plunged by a staggering bpd in december
standard chartered argues that the main threat to global oil demand and oil prices comes from europe not china too is a source of demand weakness
more than a handful of metrics point to an economic slowdown including negative pmi numbers a decline in car sales and slowing imports and exports
the outcome of the trade negotiations will go a long way to deciding what happens next
for now the evidence seems to suggest that both the american and chinese governments are eager to make a deal
related the world s largest battery to power the permianhowever major oil forecasters have had to slightly lower their demand estimates for this year after previously holding them steady
opec lowered its estimate by bpd while the eia made a similar revision
the big question is if these changes were or the start of more chartered puts out a weekly index which offers a gauge on market sentiment
the latest reading was a a huge swing from the week before and the most negative reading since december
the main source of weakness came from the implied demand readings which were lower for all seven main product groupings and lower than the average of february for all products except propane the investment bank assuming demand estimates remain mostly unchanged they stand in contrast to the ongoing upward revisions to supply specifically shale growth
the eia came out with a whopping revision of bpd to supply growth for expecting an average of million barrels per a separate report the drilling productivity report the eia expects the to add another bpd in march compared to february another massive jump in output
the gains are led by the permian basin bpd with smaller additions from demand combined with production from shale presents serious downside risks to the oil market
the upswing in oil prices appears to have ended for now
it seems that the sharp rise in oil production in the us is having a slowing effect after all commerzbank wrote in a note on an underestimated niche in oil gas production at the permian basin the largest shale play is set to exceed million barrels per day for the first time in march
as such this shale play alone significantly exceeds the amounts produced by the united arab emirates brazil and kuwait
only five countries produce more oil than the permian basin excluding the us commerzbank these gains are largely baked in at this point the shale complex still has some glaring problems
shale companies are not uniformly profitable in fact many are not profitable at all
investors are increasingly demanding production restraint in favor of shareholder returns
that still could slow if the drilling treadmill ever slows down growth will take a hit
the production frenzy of the last few years means that the legacy decline rate the losses from existing wells already online has also exploded
in march the permian is expected to lose bpd in declines from legacy wells a figure that has doubled since the start of
to be sure there is enough new output bpd to ensure a net gain of bpd but the drilling treadmill has accelerated significantly
as such when the permian hits a rough patch so will this may be a problem for another day
