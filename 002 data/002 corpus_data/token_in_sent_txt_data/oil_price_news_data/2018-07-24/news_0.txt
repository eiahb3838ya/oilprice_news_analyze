coloradoâ€™s shale boom threatened by ballot initiative
there s a good chance that a ballot initiative to significantly expand the buffer zones between oil and gas wells and homes and other buildings could be up for voting by colorado residents in the november the politically mixed state of colorado residents still remember last year s deadly explosion at a home in firestone and people in some towns have tried to ban fracking almost succeeded
two years ago colorado s supreme court overturned bans on fracking in fort collins and longmont because it found that they conflicted with the application of the state s oil and gas conservation the ballot initiative s organizers to push the distance of oil and gas wells further away from homes manage to get the required signatures by august the november election could be the inflection point for colorado s oil and gas industry and have significant implications for oil and gas companies including anadarko extraction oil gas inc and noble energy analysts s field production of crude oil reached a record high last bpd according to figures by the eia
in as a result of the slump in oil prices production had dropped to bpd from bpd in
with the oil price rise in and so far this year colorado s oil production in april increased by percent over march to stand at bpd
that s a jump from april last year the eia data colorado leading campaign of the ballot the initiative that calls for establishing the buffer zone required between oil and gas wells and homes schools and other occupied structures to feet or nearly half a mile up from feet required to an analysis by the colorado oil and gas conservation commission from earlier this month initiative would place percent of colorado s land unavailable for new oil and gas development
of the land in colorado percent would be inaccessible using these same criteria according to the commission
in colorado s top five oil and gas producing counties combined percent of the surface acreage would be unavailable
related is the oil world in panic mode the colorado alliance of mineral and royalty owners camro says that since the colorado land board s education funds have received more than us million in revenue from oil and gas leases in colorado s wattenberg field and schools would face financial hardships if the ballot initiative it s not just mineral owners who have a lot at stake if something like initiative which would enact setbacks and eliminate oil and gas development on percent of land passes
all of colorado should be deeply concerned about the impact the initiative would have on our communities and future workforce said neil ray president of camro
colorado s schools would face extreme financial hardship
our schools already have experienced budget cuts
can they withstand additional hits financially
our students deserve even if the initiative makes it to the ballot and even if it wins approval the slim republican majority in the state senate could move to soften the blow to the oil and gas industry according to bloomberg
but the republican majority could also change in the november the democrat contender for governor representative jared polis hasn t clearly stated his stance on fracking but analysts say that he can t afford to undermine the oil and gas industry in colorado

i find that hard to believe welles fitzpatrick an analyst for suntrust robinson humphrey told colorado democratic party officially supports the initiative
while candidates may take guidance they are not bound by the party s positions on the gubernatorial race in november the democrat polis will face republican walker stapleton who said on twitter earlier this week that colorado democrats and congressman jared polis want to destroy colorado s energy industry and its jobs
we can not let congressman polis and his fellow extremists impose their radical agenda on hardworking if the ballot initiative raises enough signatures to go to the polls colorado s future oil and gas industry could be shaped by a crucial vote in the november tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
