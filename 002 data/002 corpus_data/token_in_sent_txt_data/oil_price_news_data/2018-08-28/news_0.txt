the single biggest breakthrough in oil tech this year
utah holds the largest reserves of oil sands in the united states but up until now no company had the technology to exploit these vast the potential only a few companies are pursuing the and development of the state oil shale and oil sand resources the eia said in a report on the state essentially writing off the region as a meaningful that could change in the very near future
petroteq energy hopes to bring the first commercially profitable oil sands production online in the united states in the next few we have a very disruptive technology david sealock petroteq s ceo told the new york times in a sweeping profile of the innovative oil sands company
there was a treasure chest here that didn t have a key and this technology is the unlike canada s oil sands characterized by vast toxic tailings ponds and environmental destruction petroteq has pioneered a breakthrough approach to oil sands production that minimizes the environmental uses a proprietary technology involving solvents that cleanly extract heavy oil sands by separating out the oil from the rock
crucially unlike destructive processes used in alberta petroteq s approach uses no water at all and does not pollute the soil
what s in canada is an environmental nightmare jerry bailey president of petroteq told the nytimes
with our operation nothing goes in the air nothing goes in the ground and there is no water the company crushes oil sands mixes it with solvents and spins the mixture in centrifuges
the process yields oil separated from the sand
the sand free of oil and solvents can be returned to the earth while the solvents can be reused
the entire process makes a mockery of traditional oil sands processing which involves vast quantities of water chemicals heat and toxic top of that utah would not have the same pipeline trouble that has plagued canada s oil sands
producers in alberta have proposed several pipeline projects that would essentially travel the length of the north american continent several of which have been blocked at every turn most notably transcanada s keystone xl pipeline
utah oil producers such as petroteq wouldn t have this problem
petroteq sells its crude to local refineries which can process the oil into diesel fuel

sealock used to work for chevron and two oil sands companies in canada while bailey is a former exxonmobil are starting small but have huge ambitions
petroteq has plenty of oil to work with and the company is eyeing the to billion barrels of estimated oil sands reserves in utah plus more in the surrounding rocky mountain states
but obviously utah is not the only place in the world with heavy oil sands
petroteq wants to license its technology to companies in australia colombia trinidad tobago and many other big question though is whether or not the company can make a profit
petroteq claims it can breakeven with oil prices at just per barrel putting it on par with some of the most competitive shale basins in the including the permian basin
and with wti trading just below per barrel there is a large margin of error to work analysts are somewhat impressed if guarded about the novelty of the new technology
the price is now in a zone where petroteq can possibly justify what they are trying to do kevin birn an oil sands expert at ihs markit told the nytimes
if the last decade has told us anything i d hesitate to rule out the potential for technology to generate new sources of energy petroteq is currently producing barrels per day with a plan to scale that up to barrels per day in three years
to be sure this is a relatively minor operation in the grand scheme of things but it would likely spark broader investor interest clearing the way for utah s oil sands charles kennedy for an investment advisor
