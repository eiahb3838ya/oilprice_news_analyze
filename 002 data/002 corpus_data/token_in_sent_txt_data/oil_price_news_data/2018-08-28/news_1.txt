solving the permian pipeline problem
the fracking revolution in the has considerably changed the global oil market and the strategic calculations of market participants
the initial entry of shale oil producers caused a crash in prices due to the sudden flooding of the market in
the steep decline in prices led to a landmark deal between the largest oil producers
the agreement to reduce production by million barrels per day significantly raised prices to a more sustainable level to the benefit of the world is facing several risks that could again significantly impact the price of oil only this time not a downward revision but upward
obviously lower prices are favorable to consumers for whom the sharp decline in was profitable
however the looming perfect storm of geopolitical and technical problems threatens to destabilize the trouble in several regions has decreased supply
the civil war in libya and unrest in venezuela has taken hundreds of thousands of barrels per day off the market
president trump s confrontational policy towards iran and the imposition of sanctions risks tightening the global oil market even the past shale producers have proven to fill some of the gap left by others
the relative efficiency and speed with which shale producers are able to increase or decrease output has made them extremely reactive to prices
however trouble looms ahead as a problem independent from oil production itself risks derailing some of the prospects transportation permian shale is one of the most productive areas globally with a production of million barrels per day
to put that into perspective it is comparable to the average daily oil production in the united arab emirates
however the inland position of the production area requires significant pipeline infrastructure to export to international markets and refining facilities on the gulf of mexico
road transportation is not an option as it is too expensive costing on average between and dollars per barrel for a trip
related saudi king stepped in to call off aramco iposeveral companies however have already made plans for additional pipelines
one of those is epic midstream holding
the company intends to build its first pipeline in the americas from the permian base towards corpus christi
the pipeline was designed to carry barrels per day which was more than sufficient during the planning stage
the enormous production growth in the permian however has prompted the company to reconsider its capacity
plains all american pipelines and philips are considering the same with a total capacity of million barrels
click to enlarge the investment in infrastructure is a welcome development for producers but their patience is also being tested
obviously construction will take some time with most pipelines set to become operational in or
in the meantime producers are expected to curtail the rapid development of additional wells as there is no capacity to transport those extra iea for its part predicts oil production to grow by million barrels in and million in in its june oil market report less than in its previous report
the bulk of the growth should come from the largest and most productive field the permian basin
the downward revision of the iea acknowledges the production constraints due to bottlenecks
related can the bring iranian oil exports to zero traditionally opec members spare capacity has prevented major price swings
however the more members pump oil to compensate for reductions in other regions
iran and venezuela the less capacity remains to utilize during a later stage
saudi fears of iranian domination of the middle east has led to increased support in riyadh for trump s goal to reduce iranian export of oil zero barrels per trump vehemently detests the iran nuclear deal its predecessor made
however domestic issues currently weigh more than iran as midterm elections loom
rising fuel prices could hurt republican support and the administration is aware of this fact which could explain washington towards its policy regarding waivers on the import of iranian administration seems aware of the impact the absence of iranian oil could have on the global oil market which already is tight with limited available spare vanand meliksetian for top reads from
