saudi arabia wonâ€™t bring 2 million bpd online
president trump said in a tweet on saturday that saudi arabia agreed to boost oil production by million barrels per day a claim that surely came as news to the spoke to king salman of saudi arabia and explained to him that because of the turmoil disfunction in iran and venezuela i am asking that saudi arabia increase oil production maybe up to barrels to make up the difference prices to high
he has agreed the tightening of the oil market has pushed up prices which is always a concern for politicians wary of catching heat from their decision by in june to hike production by looks increasingly inadequate in dealing with the growing number of supply outages around the world
it s no surprise that trump wants more saudi oil on the market but he likely misunderstood what the saudis told arabia was producing in may and recent reports suggest they might add as much as bpd to in july a massive increase in such a short period of it s a far cry from the that trump thinks saudi arabia will add
that would translate into overall production of around which is probably unrealistic for a few there are technical questions about how far and how fast saudi arabia can push its oil fields
can they ramp up to
probably but there is not a lot of historical evidence to go on
also they probably can t do it immediately it would take time perhaps more than a second and more important reason why saudi arabia won t comply with trump s wishes to add another onto the market is that they don t want to
ramping up that much would leave the oil market dangerously low on spare capacity cutting it down to less than
at that point any supply disruption would send oil prices skyrocketing
indeed it wouldn t even take a tangible disruption the mere possibility of another outage would lead to a significant volatility
related oil exports overtake opec s number course saudi arabia is aware of this which is why it is extremely hard to imagine them adding that is why the white house walked back president trump s comments when they published details of trump s conversation with king salman
in response to the president s assessment of a deficit in the oil market king salman affirmed that the kingdom maintains a two million barrel per day spare capacity which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance and stability the statement from the white house supply by is a very different thing than prudently using spare capacity to ensure market nevertheless trump is probably right that the oil market needs more supply
and opec could struggle to meet the emerging supply gap which seems to grow worse with each passing day
venezuela has lost close to in the past two years and could lose another bpd over the next year
an outage in canada is expected to send a little over bpd offline for the month of july
and trump himself could be responsible for disrupting around or more of iranian do forget the one negative to the iran deal is that you lose a lot of oil and they got to make up for it
and who is their big enemy
iran
you think of it
iran is their big enemy so they are going to have to do it trump said on sunday in a fox news interview
and i have a very good relationship with the saudi king and with the crown prince of saudi arabia and with the others around and they are going to have to put out more related india folds under pressure halts iranian oil importsover the weekend the oil market received another jolt on news that force majeure will likely be declared at two additional libyan export terminals which has translated into the disruption of more than bpd and has pushed the country s output down to a paltry bpd
it s a staggering loss and it almost wipes out the planned increase from the oil prices did not spike at the start of trading on monday which suggests oil traders clearly didn t entirely dismiss president trump s bold claim that opec would add
the market is probably betting that saudi arabia could add more supply than previously as the supply outages mount saudi arabia is in danger of losing control of the market
riyadh does not want to burn through all of its spare capacity which means it won t add something like
however that means that the market is starting to look undersupplied for the second half of
it s a tricky balance for riyadh wanting to keep the market balanced but also wanting to keep dry powder for future likely the saudis will opt for allowing prices to go higher rather than using up most of their spare nick cunningham of top reads from
