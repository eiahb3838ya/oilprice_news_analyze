what trumpâ€™s tweet actually means for oil
after a weekend of turmoil largely caused by president trump s twitter diplomacy the international oil cartel could soon be facing a new previously reported saudi arabia and iran have been on a collision course since the recent vienna meeting
tehran has openly opposed the oil production increase but was willing to compromise based on an understanding that opec members would fall below a percent compliance rate in the existing agreement
at the same time saudi arabia the largest spare production capacity holder seemed to be reluctant to flood the market right away
a consensus was found in which opec members could produce more by filling the gaps in supply caused by the sanctions on iran and falling venezuelan supply disruptions have been far greater than opec had originally prepared for with the recent force majeur in libya being an example of that
some analysts believed that a small opec increase would be enough to stabilize the market without putting extreme pressure on prices
in their opinion saudi spare capacity alongside the shale oil boom should have been enough to counter any mishap in the narrative was taken as a fact by the mainstream media and western political leaders with trump being one of its main supporters
the idea of ever increasing shale oil production which would help balance out the markets was supported by the myth of energy independency and global energy was considered a caretaker that would only be used once all other options ran out
but washington s dream of energy dependence dominating the global oil market has evaporated with a tweet of less than words
trump s tweet indicating that he had asked saudi king salman to raise production by million bpd can be seen as an admission of the dependence on opec
it can be read as the president officially admiting that the is not able to counter the expected removal of iran s oil export volumes with its own shale production boom
in order to mitigate the damage the state department soon responded with its own assessment of the between the two leaders

officials have reiterated that trump s views are being noted as a concern but decisions are being made from within opec not by outsiders
still volatility has shot up resulting in doubts on all fronts about the stability of opec as a group the viability of the vienna agreement the role of iran and the overall spare production capacity available on the markets
this doubt over spare production capacity is now sure to be an unexpected boon for deal within opec is needed soon to counter the possibility of a real price hike as millions of barrels per day of oil are expected to leave the market before the end of
in fact crunch time may have already arrrived with libyan oil production constraints growing and the specter of a prolonged war pushing still more uncertainty
the deal from vienna already seems irrelevant not just due to the iranian hardline opposition but due to geopolitical first priority at present will need to be to counter unrest in the market and fill up any supply gap caused by libya
at the same time opec s secretary general barkindo and opec chairman mazrouei need to find a solution to prevent iran from hijacking the market
tehran has already been calling for a possible emergency meeting
if this comes to fruition within the next weeks prices will be shooting through the roof
iran is also facing another issue with internal unrest destabilizing the country
the only financial for the islamic republic seems to be oil and gas
analysts should keep an eye on these reports as it will fuel the confrontation within opec for the only way at present to be clear about oil politics is maybe to be a twitter addict
trump s usage of this internet phenomena is already causing havoc
what is notable however is that by blaming opec for manipulating the oil market the president appears to be admitting that shale oil is still not the power player it is depicted as being
the future of shale oil was already in doubt and trump latest tweet just adds fuel to that fire
the blaming opec for pushing oil prices up is somewhat ironic in itself and the largest catalyst for oil prices has been the leaving of the iran deal by the
if analysts are to read trump latest tweet as an admission that shale is unable to make up for the loss of iranian oil prices will be given yet another boost

by emphasizing the power and importance of the oil cartel opec is being forced to show its cards
saudi arabia has been pushed into a corner as they are now the one source that most observers will be watching to bring more production online
the need for additional volumes is clear
in the coming weeks riyadh will need to open up every resource valve and storage tank to keep up the dream of a oil market whatever happens
if they can t manage to do this saudi arabia and opec could be about to face a broader crisis
a shortage on the supply side is not what all parties are currently vying for
prices should stabilize around per barrel leaving enough room for economic growth
trump s tweet has now broken this per barrel upper
shale oil is most probably smiling as their production horizon is based
a quick buck is better than supply security
for opec russia and the global economy a stable price is a necessity
trump s tweets however are causing total destruction including for his own voters looking for lower gasoline cyril widdershoven of top reads from
