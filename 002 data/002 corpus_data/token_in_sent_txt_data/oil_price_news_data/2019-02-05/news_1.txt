china faces an uphill battle for energy independence
a reuters report last week examining china renewed oil and gas exploration and production push should make the country s oil majors beijing energy planners and just about everybody else in the country s oil patch breathe a collective sigh of relief but at the end of the day the question has to be asked will it still be enough first the good newsfirst the good news china s national oil companies are raising spending on domestic oil and gas drilling to the highest levels since
this push comes as chinese president xi jinping calls for the country to boost energy development to enhance national energy security
a few months ago china national petroleum corporation cnpc one of china largest oil majors with some billion in revenue in announced an oil discovery at mahu in the junggar basin which has million tonnes of oil in place one of the largest oil finds onshore china in years
approximately million tonnes will be technically recoverable
annual output at mahu will reach over million tonnes per year in three years a demonstrative addition to the tonne per year xinjiang a few months ago petrochina cnpc s listed arm struck sizeable oil and gas flow in exploration well in the tarim basin in the xinjiang region in northwestern china
tested a daily natural gas flow of cubic meters and condensate of cubic meters
the well is located in the southern part of kuche trough in the tarim basin part of a exploration zone

production at cnpc s flagship shale gas play chuannan in southern sichuan hit a daily record of million cubic meters in late december up from million cubic meters in october the reuters report said citing cnpc data
cnpc also struck high volumes of gas flows at four exploration wells at dagang near beijing that could lead to a sizeable gas field called good newscnooc china largest offshore driller also has joined the act
the firm discovered meters of gas bearing deposit and meters of structure and tested daily gas flows of million cubic feet
bozhong also in the bohai sea is an oil find with potentially million tonnes of oil reserve in place
cnooc completed eight appraisal wells by august km off china s southernmost province of hainan is cnooc s deepwater find
cnooc made a final investment decision in march and total investment is estimated at billion billion yuan
energy consultancies wood mackenzie and ihs markit estimate that the block at an average water depth of meters feet has recoverable reserves of trillion cubic rest of the storydespite beijing s push to ramp up oil and gas development it will not be enough to offset the projected increase of both hydrocarbons while aging fields and infrastructure will still be an impediment for china goal of greater energy security and
in other words the goal of energy independence is out of reach for china in the foreseeable future at least in the era dominated by fossil fuels

meanwhile at the end of last year china surpassed south korea as the second largest importer of liquefied natural gas lng and is projected to bypass japan within the next few years to become the top global lng importer a dynamic unthinkable just a few years increase gas usage comes amid beijing s mandate that gas make up at least percent of the country s energy mix by with further earmarks to in an effort to clean up rampant air pollution particularly in its major urban centers
china already the world s largest oil and coal importer will see its gas imports approach the level of the european union by the international energy agency iea forecasted last oil and gas push also has geopolitical overtones amid beijing s ongoing development in disputed areas in the south china sea
as china continues its buildup and militarization of artificial islands in the area against growing international scorn and among concern from its neighbors in the region it will nonetheless be tempted to drill for more oil and gas in these areas it now claims as sovereign tim daiss for top reads from
