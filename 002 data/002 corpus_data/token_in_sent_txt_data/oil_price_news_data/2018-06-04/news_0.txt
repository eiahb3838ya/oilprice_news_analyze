the oil trader tug-of-war
despite the recent brent crude prices continue to be supported by geopolitical events and supply concerns while the benchmark wti crude has been pressured to the downside by pipeline constraints in the most prolific shale basin amid american oil discount of wti crude to brent crude topped a barrel last week and even touched a barrel last thursday
the spread is currently at its highest since huge discount of the oil benchmark to the international benchmark is setting the stage for a between oil majors and big oil trading houses that seek to capitalize on the wide price gap to make profitable arbitrage exports of crude oil on the one hand and hedge funds and other money managers who bet that wti will be pushed further into funds are betting that the spread will continue to widen while physical oil traders bet on record oil export volumes to narrow that gap brokers and traders tell wti discount to brent has doubled from around a barrel in while production continues to break records by the week and the permian faces takeaway capacity constraints

pipeline congestion could become a significant challenge to oil production early next year especially for smaller producers because larger operators are more likely to have contracts for takeaway capacity according to the dallas it s not currently restricting growth pipeline capacity is an issue in the permian and is expected to further discount wti prices to on the wide spread andy lipow president of consultancy lipow oil associates told the financial times the market is telling you that the pipelines are if there was enough pipeline capacity the spread would be no more than the pipeline tariff lipow spread is widening even though crude oil exports are also rising and recently reached an weekly high of million generally there should be a fairly linear relationship between exports and the arbitrage michael tran global energy strategist at rbc capital markets told bloomberg
