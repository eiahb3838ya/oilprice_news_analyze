u.s. oil production is rising much faster than expected
shale executives have gone to great lengths to convince investors that they will not drill aggressively now that oil prices have rallied into the
but in a new report released on tuesday the eia essentially said that those assurances are just a lot of hot eia s energy outlook predicted that oil production would top million barrels per day this year
last month the agency said that the wouldn t hit that threshold until november revision from just a few weeks ago is dramatic
in january the eia estimated that the would surpass at some point in february
but recently published data shows that the actually hit that milestone last november and now the agency says the actually averaged in an annual basis the produced last year a figure that is set to jump to for
things slow down a bit in with an average of do we make of all of this
well the shale industry is clearly drilling at a frenzied pace with an increasing concentration in the permian basin
the rig count continues to rise in the permian while remaining mostly flat elsewhere
so far the permian has shown no signs of slowing down despite some evidence of bottlenecking and cost inflation
production continues to rise at a scorching rate
related oil prices fall on rising crude inventoriesthe big question at this point is how rapidly expanding shale production will interact with the pace of inventory and the opec production limits
some analysts including goldman sachs and s p global platts recently raised the prospect of opec tightening the oil market too much allowing inventories to drain well below the massive upward revision in shale production from the eia might dampen those concerns
the eia says that inventories will build by an average of over the course of and and the agency predicts brent will average just per barrel this global financial turmoil is testing oil prices
wti and brent have retreated from recent highs over the last few trading days dragged down by the global selloff
the enormous build up in bullish bets from hedge funds and other money managers presents a deeper downside goldman sachs shrugged off the instability and reiterated its bullish case for commodities for this year
in fact the selloff increases the odds of more gains in the months ahead goldman analysts argue
commodities proved to work just as advertised during the sudden selloff in equities jeffrey currie the bank s head of commodities research said in a bloomberg television interview
in fact you saw base metals and gold trade up as the equity market went related the world s biggest oil benchmark could change forever historically when you look at commodities they perform very well during cycles currie said
oil s what we called backwardated where spot prices sit above forward prices so you buy at a discount and roll up the curve
in other words it pays you to be the investment bank says there is no reason to abandon the bullish case for commodities for this year
goldman predicts brent will top per barrel within six that is the case then surely the shale industry will accelerate drilling
after all the eia sees the industry adding upwards of between january and it might be too soon to tell if shale drillers are going to abandon those claims of restraint
goldman sachs said in a research note that the most recent spending plans and guidance published by a select few shale drillers does not necessarily point to a mentality
goldman looked at shale companies that released specifics and the capex and production estimates from those companies are about equal to consensus estimates
in other words the recent rally in oil prices has not significantly altered the approach of the shale industry for at least not eia s latest prediction however assumes the shale industry throws caution to the wind
