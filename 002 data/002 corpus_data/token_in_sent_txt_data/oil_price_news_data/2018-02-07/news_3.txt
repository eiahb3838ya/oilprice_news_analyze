exxon to produce all of its oil despite peak demand fears
exxonmobil was forced to finally acknowledge the possibility that future climate change policy could lead to peak oil demand a serious threat to the company s operations over the response to a shareholder resolution passed last year the oil major just released a report that recognizes the danger of peak oil demand
by climate change policies and regulations could cut into oil demand leading to a drop in consumption by this scenario oil demand would decline by an average of percent per year with the lower end of the range seeing declines of percent per would mean that global oil demand would decline to million barrels per day by down from in
in the most pessimistic scenario from the oil industry s perspective demand drops to s a rather bleak picture for oil and one echoed by a long list of analysts environmental groups and increasingly the oil industry itself
a few weeks ago a report coauthored by a top bp official lays out a case in which oil demand peaks and declines ushering in an era of permanently lower oil exxon was clearly issuing the report under duress
the tone of exxon s pathway scenario suggests that the company doesn t really see it playing out
while the report suggests that oil demand could fall exxon goes to great lengths to downplay the significance arguing that o il demand is projected to decline modestly on average and much more slowly than its natural rate of decline from existing producing fields and e ven under a pathway significant investment will be required in oil and natural gas capacity and p roduction from our proved reserves and investment in our resources continue to be needed to meet global requirements and the like

in this more bullish report exxon predicted oil demand would rise by percent through essentially the opposite conclusion from the scenario in which climate policy slashes oil can tell which one exxon really believes because it says it uses the more bullish outlook for energy report to help inform our business strategies and investment click to enlarge ultimately exxon predicts that it will be able to produce percent of the total oil and gas reserves that it has in its portfolio
the company also says that even in the climate scenarios in which demand falls ongoing investment will be needed to offset depletion from existing fields
so even in that case the oil major still believes that it will produce nearly all of the oil and gas it has on its books

exxon says that only a small portion of its reserves would be affected by climate policy but in those situations the company believes that investments could mitigate emissions and associated costs which could make them viable even in a the company would learn a lot more about the reserves in the ensuing decades
accordingly we believe the production of these reserves will likely remain economic even under the scenarios as a result exxon does not see a scenario in which it will be forced to leave oil in the ground it plans to produce everything it has even in the face of tightening climate groups say that is exactly the problem
exxonmobil s own analysis assumes the world will continue to burn through oil and gas to drive their profits and keep us on a path toward global temperatures well above the degree celsius target kathy mulvey a campaign manager at the union of concerned scientists said in an emailed statement to bloomberg
