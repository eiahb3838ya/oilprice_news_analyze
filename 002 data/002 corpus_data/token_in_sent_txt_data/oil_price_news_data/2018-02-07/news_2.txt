iran could add 100,000 bpd in “five or six days”
amid positive comments from opec on the global oil supply situation and indications that some members of the cartel are ready for a longer extension of the production cut deal iran s oil minister bijan zanganeh has sparked uncertainty with his proclamation that iran could raise its oil production in a matter of days should opec decide to scrap the deal at its meeting in to media in tehran during the weekend zanganeh said the country s crude oil production could jump by bpd within five or six days should the cartel decide that prices are high enough to stop curbing its has been talk from analysts that prices may be getting too high for opec s and russia s comfort but opec officials and russia s alexander novak have been true to the official party line the cuts will continue to the end of
the latest to comment on the state of affairs was opec s secretary general mohammed barkindo who said that oecd commercial oil inventories have steadily fallen to stand million barrels above the average in october adding that our determination and hard work are paying off
iran was allowed to cap its production rather than cut it with opec even allowing it a slight increase of bpd to million bpd
but according to bloomberg data last month iran produced less than that at million bpd
the country also recently closed two oil swap deals with russia and iraq and as analyst ellen wald noted in a recent article for these would amount to a combined bpd which doesn t leave a lot of free production capacity to match zanganeh s statement
related lng glut today shortage tomorrowof course iran is far from the most transparent country so the minister may well know something the rest of the world doesn t
on the other hand over the first ten months of this fiscal year iran s oil and condensate production already rose by bpd also according to the minister
that s a increase over ten months
it s difficult to believe iran has the resources to add another bpd in just a few s more the chances of opec ending the deal prematurely seem remote
they may draw closer in the coming months if producers continue to ramp up production at the current rate which prompted the energy information administration to revise upwards its forecasts for this year and next
now the eia expects production to hit the million bpd mark later this year reaching an average million in that s not all
now american oil has flowed to the middle east and more specifically the uae
if something like this something as unthinkable as this can happen then opec can t feel safe even on its home turf which could lead to some decision changes by certainly wants the deal gone so it can continue growing its production especially as its crude enjoys a rally that has pushed it close to the price of brent
so zanganeh is gladly stoking the fire under his fellow opec members
if we want to make a decision it has to be at the right time which is june when we ll next meet he said
but my impression is that opec members are not after very expensive oil because very expensive oil leads to price by irina slav for top reads from
