should the saudis fear the permian’s production potential?
the permian has increased its oil production more than any other shale basin in recent years and it even had its production growing when all other shale plays were scaling back production during the in the permian in west texas and eastern new mexico has grown so much that the basin now has a spare production capacity second only to saudi arabia s capacity that permian drillers could bring online in active in the permian have at least bpd of spare production capacity that could even be as much as million bpd nansen saleri former head of reservoir management at saudi aramco and now ceo at consultant quantum reservoir impact has told estimate highlights the increased importance that shale especially in the permian could play as a swing producer on the global oil for decades there was one country and one company that had spare capacity and that country was saudi arabia and that company was saudi aramco saleri told bloomberg
now we are seeing an analog to that in the permian he arabia s spare oil production capacity is estimated to be around million bpd according to data collected by opec s kingpin saudi arabia has had the greatest spare capacity in the world and has usually kept more than million bpd of spare capacity on hand for market management according to the eia which defines spare capacity as the volume of production that can be brought on within days and sustained for at least days
related statoil rising shale to keep oil prices below in to saleri the permian is capable of turning on the taps to respond to higher demand in three to four days faster than any other field in the world except for those operated by saudi everyone else the former manager at aramco also expects the permian oil production to grow substantially and reach at least million bpd in a year as less efficient drillers have left the game and only the most efficient drillers are if operators believe that oil prices will stay above for the coming six months they will go on a drilling program saleri told s latest available drilling productivity report shows that the permian oil production will grow to million bpd in february up by bpd from january contributing the most to the production growth in the key shale areas
in the february energy outlook steo published on tuesday the eia estimates that crude oil production averaged million bpd in january up bpd compared to december
total crude oil production is now expected to average million bpd in beating by million bpd the previous annual production record set in
next year crude oil production is seen averaging million permian is expected to be the main contributor to production growth in the next few permian production increases have averaged percent per year according to estimates by the dallas fed
the share of the permian in total oil production has also significantly increased over the past five years with the permian basin accounting for percent of oil in october up from percent in
related the world s biggest oil benchmark could change forever this year the international energy agency iea expects explosive growth in the with america overtaking the world s oil producer saudi arabia and rivaling the top oil producer russia provided that the deal to curb production remains throughout permian will undoubtedly play the leading role in the expected production growth although the pace of that growth will depend on many factors such as oil prices capex plans spending discipline or cost curves
according to the former saudi aramco executive the most prolific shale basin has large spare capacity second only to saudi arabia s
this makes the permian potentially capable of playing the swing producer role on global oil tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
