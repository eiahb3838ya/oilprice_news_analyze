are u.s. oil exports really unstoppable?
earlier this year when crude oil exports hit a record million bpd the figure was hailed as the beginning of a new era that could eventually see the world s top top producer for this year so export up to million bpd
some believe that nothing short of a sharp price spike can interfere with the bright future of light crude
indeed if fundamentals were the only factor at play that would be the case
alas there are more factors that can affect the future of the united states as a major oil it s worth noting why exports are growing
it s not just because of the shale boom
it s also not only because of the lifting of the oil export ban from the
an important reason for the jump in crude oil exports is the fact that as houston chronicle s rye druzin noted in a recent story a lot of refineries are simply not equipped for processing the light crude
they need heavier grades hence the still existing demand for canadian and venezuelan oil which is heavier than the light crude pumped from the could invest in new facilities that can process light crude but it is a large undertaking
still chevron is doing it although as druzin points out it might be the exception
for most exporting the crude they can t absorb in the refineries is the preferred option
so this means exports are set for a rise whatever happens right
wrong of course
there is no such thing as whatever the clearest sign yet that oil is not yet ready to take over is china s zero oil imports in august
local refiners apparently decided to be cautious amid the deepening trade row between washington and beijing and perhaps see if they can make do without crude
they did make do total chinese oil imports in august went up by percent hitting a reason china is important is that as of july it was the buyer of crude after canada
it took in percent of total oil exports last year and percent this year until august
that s more than a fifth of total exports and truth be told the receiving country mix is not that great without china
related oil s billion black marketsure producers are exporting to japan and india as well and india is a top importer of crude
but india is also having trouble with its oil bill already and oil will be hard pressed to compete with middle eastern crude which is simply a lot closer to india and hence korea is also a buyer of oil and it has a stronger economy than india and could therefore afford costlier crude for a while especially after it cut its imports of iranian oil to zero in anticipation of a pat on the head for complying with washington s request for iranian import cuts to zero
japan is a staunch ally and a major oil importer so that s good for exporters european countries notably the netherlands the uk and italy and to a lesser extent france and denmark are also buyers of crude but the amounts they need are too low to spur a true export boom
in fact morgan stanley warned about this earlier this year before the trade spat grew into a heated conflict
the prospects of oil demand growth in europe are modest at on top of it all the new emission rules of the international maritime organization will spur demand for heavier crude and shale producers may be forced to discount their crude to enhance its competitiveness
or maybe some of them will start investing in local light crude refining capacity
after all the is the largest oil consumer irina slav for top reads from
