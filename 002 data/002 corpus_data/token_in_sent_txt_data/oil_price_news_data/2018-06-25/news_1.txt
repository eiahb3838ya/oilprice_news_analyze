norwayâ€™s oil discoveries on track for best year since 2010
higher oil prices and increased efficiency have made companies more optimistic that they could spend more on exploration on the norwegian continental shelf ncs this year than they did in the previous two years of stubbornly low oil firms have boosted exploration spending more than expected and so far in they have had more success in discoveries than in the years of the oil price according to bloomberg calculations based on data by the norwegian petroleum directorate npd companies are on track to find nearly billion barrels of oil equivalents this year
these calculations show that the resources found per well could reach their highest since year in which the giant johan sverdrup oil field was discovered in the north sea with resources estimated at between billion and billion barrels of oil equivalents
johan production start planned for late be one of the most important industrial projects in norway in the next years and will be the main contributor to norway s rising oil production until from the onward production offshore norway will start to decline so making new and large discoveries quickly is necessary for maintaining production at the same level from the torgeir stordal director exploration at the npd said in the directorate s resource and exploration report published last week

the total resources found so far this year have already exceeded the volumes found in the wildcats last prices are now coming back up so activity is picking up and they ll want to drill wells that they might have held back on when oil prices were low the npd s stordal told years of high exploration activity the oil price crash led to exploration slumping from wells drilled in to just wells in and the npd said in its resource report
but this year between and exploration wells are expected to be drilled the regulator on average discoveries in recent years are smaller than before
smaller finds and fewer wells will make it demanding to maintain production over time
the number of wells drilled and the size of discoveries made must be above the average for the past decade if production is to be sustained at a high level
opportunities for making larger finds are probably greatest in areas the npd higher exploration success rate so far this year couldn t have come at a better time for norway s oil industry and the operators on its shelf
oil prices are higher than in the previous three years
the more commercially viable resources are found the more norway could push back the currently expected in production from the onward
related saudi oil minister agreement is just the beginningeven small discoveries close to existing infrastructure in the more developed areas on the shelf could be commercial if they are tied back to production maintaining a high level of exploration is important for identifying and developing small discoveries while the big installations are still on stream says the in formerly statoil struck oil earlier this month in a wildcat well drilled in the central part of the north sea and thinks the discovery will be commercial
following dismal drilling campaigns and depressed oil prices in and norway s oil industry and companies operating on its shelf may have another higher oil be happy this year if the current rate of resource discoveries tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
