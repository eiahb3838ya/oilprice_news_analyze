gasoline price set to soar despite opec+ deal
nearly everyone expected the decision to start raising oil production on friday with drivers excited to get some relief from high gas prices at the start of driving season
while opec did indeed announce the expected decision oil prices jumped and they look unlikely to trend downward any time soon for ministers claimed the group would increase its overall production by a million barrels per day but the increase is likely to be much lower because some members venezuela and iran in particular will find it difficult to increase their current level of production
exactly how much of an increase we will see remains unclear but the very fact that the production jump will be smaller than traders had hoped for has been enough to send prices fact all opec said in its statement after the friday meeting was that it will rein in its compliance rate from the percent for may to percent
estimates made on this basis suggested the actual increase will be a bit over bpd with another bpd to come from russia and signatories to the deal
that s not in the statement either it came from nigeria s oil minister emmanuel ibe wonder then that wti booked a rise of percent last week and though it might ease off the current highs it will hardly fall low enough for drivers to be happy
driving season means greater demand for gasoline and greater demand invariably means higher prices
also as gasbuddy senior petroleum analyst dan mcteague told npr driving season also sees refineries churn out more fuels that are costlier to produce
related saudi oil minister agreement is just the beginning my guess is that you are going to see sustained higher prices at least for the foreseeable future end of the summer mcteague said rubbing salt into the wound by adding that prices at the pump this year are likely to be possibly the highest since at least makes perfect sense since crude oil prices are now the highest in more than three years but not everybody is so pessimistic
the aaa npr reports is actually upbeat about gas prices expecting the beneficial effect of higher opec and russia production to make itself visible some time later when the production increase actually the other hand the strength of this effect might not be particularly great again for seasonal reasons
what we are seeing is a fairly typical pattern energy outlook analyst timothy hess from the energy information administration told npr
prices at the pump will likely inch up as july weekend approaches with the eia projecting peak summer prices of per gallon next seasonal supply and demand dynamics aside it is likely that traders were just too optimistic about opec and russia s meeting last week possibly expecting russia to prevail with its proposed million bpd increase in total production although that claim was highly questionable from the reports suggested the was a tactical move to get the more unwilling opec members on the output increase train by first hitting them with the proposal and then lowering it to a more palatable level
if that was the case the goal was accomplished
unfortunately this won t help drivers this summer irina slav for top reads from
