saudi oil minister: opec+ agreement is just the beginning
opec s decision to rein in compliance rates with the oil production cut deal is interim saudi arabia s oil minister khalid said after the meeting as quoted by kuwait s news agency on his remark the official said this meant that producers from the cartel were not obliged to strictly adhere to the new production ceiling which in itself is a vague one since the official opec statement following the friday meeting did not include a ceiling it said was that the conference hereby decided that countries will strive to adhere to the overall conformity level of down to as of july for the remaining duration of the above mentioned resolution and for the jmmc to monitor and report back to the president of the falih further made a point of reasserting saudi arabia s commitment to the deal despite already abundant evidence to that effect by saying that opec s producer could lift production by million bpd but it would not do so because it is an inseparable part of a gathering that functions with solidarity and partnership for stability of the global oil unfortunately it seems that this dedication has not played out as expected crude oil prices actually jumped last week after the conclusion of the meeting which was the opposite of what the meeting sought to reason for the jump was that traders either overestimated russia s clout with opec or simply took the initial suggestions made by and alexander novak too literally
