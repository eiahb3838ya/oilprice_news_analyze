can the gulf of mexico break its oil production record?
was the highest producing year for oil in the gom and included the record month in march
gas which has tended to come from shallow water wells had accelerated decline
the production would have been higher but for some disruptions from hurricanes in particular nate though that had the least impact onshore and some unplanned outages in november and december due to equipment failures
the failure to delta house subsea manifold affected rigel otis and son of bluto fields and the first two still appear to be while son of bluto resumed production in december llog the operator i think calls the rigel field neidermeyer which is much better for the animal house theme
the enchilada gas pipeline appears to have ruptured at the main platform and has resulted in baldpate salsa llano cardamom and magnolia going
plans were recently announced to restart which do not go through the platform but i haven t seen any notice of the restart
click to enlarge c c productiondecember production numbers were dominated by the unplanned outages so comparisons with november don t mean much
as well as the two issues given above the tahiti and fields were off line for a few weeks though i have seen no news why these share a common set of leases but are produced separately to the tahiti and constitution platforms
each month that these are three issues hold current outages would knock about to kbpd off the achievable average production for
click to enlarge despite recent variability it certainly looks like the new fields brought on since late and which have seen all the net growth since then have peaked
any average decline rate can t really be extrapolated yet given the recent upsets but the boem reserve estimate updates due in the next couple of months will provide better numbers as there will be longer operating data for all the fields
click to enlarge bp shell anadarko chevron and bhp have completed a lot of brownfield work and drilling to maintain production at their large operated platforms but they may be running out of options for the next couple of years and there is some evidence of rising water cut in some of the larger leases at shenzi atlantis and thunder horse and also in west boreas a recent for shell in
click to enlarge natural gas productionnatural gas production saw accelerated decline through mostly from rapid decline of hadrian south and the enchilada outage
shallow fields added some production late in the year all from one lease in the eugene island area
click to enlarge click to enlarge apart from hadrian south most of the gas from new fields is associated with the oil production and will decline in line with that
otis is a small gas field that has been held offline by the delta house outage
click to enlarge the impact from the loss of baldpate salsa production which are mostly gas producers is shown here however also evident is how fast those fields had been declining anyway since southhadrian south looks to have finished
production had been dropping fast since the summer and then in october and november water production appeared and gas flow stopped
on plateau it produced mmscfd from only two wells which is pretty prolific and slightly higher than planned
the wells had been producing about equally but one died between may and july and the second in november
both were offline throughout what trump s tariffs mean for global oil and gasoverall the field s total recovery is lower than the boem reserve estimate but only by about bcf mmbbls so it s questionable whether there will be any further efforts at increased recovery certainly in the near future as there is no drilling rig contracted there although there is another qualified lease for the field that has not yet been produced
click to enlarge production wells creaming curves the following two charts show the number of producing wells for new fields and the larger mature platforms
they both show how wells were added from through leading to the increased production in these two groups but both numbers have now flattened off which is likely to precede the start of a decline
for the new additions the move to with one or two wells in and is evident and the continuous development at also stands out
click to enlarge click to enlarge drilling activityby active drill rigs averaged in compared to almost in and the numbers have continued to drop this year with a low of earlier in march the lowest since though the drop in shallow gas drilling is responsible for by far most of the change
click to enlarge boem gives a monthly break down of each well by category and it is noticeable how the number of wells being drilled has fallen off in the second half of
i think inactive wells are those that have not yet seen any production but sometimes these are counted as temporarily abandoned of which there are many and therefore it s impossible to pick out new ones from old
click to enlarge plansthe stampede platform started up in january
it has nameplate of kbpd but some of that is for potential future
the wells are and it should reach or kbpd stream day production quickly though maybe not with high availability oil prices tear higher on middle east tensionsllog plan to bring several fields on line with one to three well to existing platforms
however red zinger and la femme blue wing olive go to delta house
the subsea system is likely to be fixed when these are due but the platform was operating at nameplate capacity and with extended production deferral may not have processing capacity for these new wells this has planned five wells in existing fields in particular for constellation with bp which will be about kbpd
anadarko have stated that they are looking at redeploying spar platforms onto other fields probably for shenandoah
i think that means one or more of their developments are nearing end of life despite recent near field and that their remaining green field prospects are not very attractive at current oil prices
the platform mentioned was marlin though they have other mature spar facilities like holstein which may impact llog as their for crown anchor are due to go there but may have relatively short lives and also is the site for two of this year s new wells so maybe this is just conceptual speculation at the foot is due at the end of the year
it was originally planned for but had mechanical failures during installation which are now fixed
capacity is kbpd nameplate
it is heavy oil and uses dry trees with esps
two wells are but the rest only have the top two conductor sections ready therefore will be through as new wells get peak oil barrelmore top reads from
