what trump's new appointment means for oil prices
president trump fired his national security advisor
mcmaster on thursday and replaced him with a staunch proponent of war
the appointment significantly raises the odds of a clash with iran and north korea and almost certainly will result in the withdrawal of the from the iran bolton was a fierce supporter of the war in iraq and comes to the white house as an unreconstructed proponent of the invasion
in fact one would be hard pressed to name a proposed war that he has not supported
in the past he has repeatedly advocated for military conflict in both north korea and iran preemptively and that remains the case the has been negotiating with european officials over how to amend the iran nuclear deal to appease donald trump
germany the uk and france have entertained stepping up some measures to iran s ballistic missiles program the end date of the limits on the nuclear program and the authority of international nuclear inspectors with an eye on keeping the in the wsj reports that the wants the deal extended in perpetuity but europe says that would amount to a renegotiation of the entire deal
the sticking point leaves plenty of room for the hardline government to find a pretext to withdraw from the deal
that was the case before john bolton s appointment
with john bolton now chirping in trump s ear few expect the iran deal to survive in year bolton released a blueprint on how the could and should get out of the deal a deal that he called a threat to in the plan he says unilateral sanctions should be imposed and he also said we will discuss military he explicitly says the should provide assistance to a variety of opposition groups in iran stopping just short of a endorsement of regime change although that was clearly the oil major that won t leave iranneedless to say bolton s appointment as national security advisor likely means the end of involvement in the iran nuclear deal
the deadline to extend a waiver on sanctions is may
bolton is an unrepentant advocate of regime change against iran and his demands for the may ultimatum in a practical sense will be sharper than those of mcmaster richard nephew a principal deputy coordinator for sanctions policy at the state department during the obama administration told s p global platts
nephew authored a recent report that estimated that iran could lose to bpd if sanctions were on seemed to telegraph his intentions on tuesday
a lot of bad things are happening in iran trump said on march just before meeting with saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman
the iran nuclear deal is coming up in one month and you will see what happens
ultimately at this point sanctions on iran are likely and in a scenario the could begin exploring military options against iran
to say the least the risk of war is much higher after bolton s a similar scenario is possible for north korea
bolton wrote an in february titled the legal case for striking north korea first and last year he said on fox news i think the only diplomatic option left is to end the regime in north korea by effectively having the south take it over
president trump s with north korea s kim may not happen and the odds of a military strike are now much oil markets should fear a demand shortageif trump meets kim it should be a fairly brief session where trump says tell me you have begun total denuclearization because we re not going to have protracted negotiations
you can tell me right now or we ll start thinking of something else bolton said earlier this month
that something else was clearly a reference to a preemptive military strike against north korea summit is supposed to take place in may the same month that the could scrap the iran nuclear deal and sanctions
may is shaping up to a fateful month for foreign fallout could have wide ramifications for the oil market a lot of oil supply could be put at risk this year after the dramatic reshuffling of the government over the past two weeks which has created the most radically aggressive foreign policy team around the american president in modern memory according to the new york it could occur at a time when the oil market is getting tighter anyway raising the odds of much higher prices
we are only weeks away from peak refinery maintenance after which crude and product demand should accelerate
global inventories are already at the bottom end of the range
with the inventory cushion largely gone oil prices will likely be more sensitive to geopolitical risk factors morgan stanley said in a research note
there are sufficient reasons to expect oil prices to strengthen further from here and we stick with our brent per barrel call for morgan stanley could be a conservative estimate if bolton succeeds in pushing the trump administration in a much more hawkish direction as seems nick cunningham of top reads from
