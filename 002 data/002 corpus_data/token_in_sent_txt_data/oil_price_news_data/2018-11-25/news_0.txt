can opec+ halt the oil price slide?
oil prices continue to plumb new depths but some analysts think the selloff has gone too prices fell to per barrel by hitting nearly a low
the bearish narrative has taken hold in a big way with rising shale production record output from saudi arabia rising inventories and faltering demand growth all combining to drag down crude prices
the bears still have the oil market firmly in their grip commerzbank said in a note on thursday
no end to the downswing is in sight for the foreseeable but are prices dropping too far too fast
some analyst think so
t he oil market has overshot current and forward fundamentals goldman sachs wrote in a note on november sachs believes that the most recent selloff which saw brent drop below came with no new fundamental data suggesting that the drop reflects a confluence of factors including expectations of a glut in speculative trading low trading activity ahead of the thanksgiving holiday as well as the broader selloff in global the fundamentals have been trending in a bearish direction
and even though has sent signals that a production cut is on the table other bits of news have been negative
libya expects to be exempted from the production cut and its output continues to rise steadily
venezuela s output fell by less than expected in october
iraq and kurdistan just agreed to allow for some oil up to bpd initially to resume flowing through a kurdish pipeline
if the tentative agreement holds and the two sides build on it another bpd could will take a fundamental catalyst for prices to stabilize goldman argues
while we expect prices to eventually recover we continue to expect high price volatility until evidence that the oil market fundamentals are improving requiring a decline in opec production and signs that demand growth is related plunging oil prices weigh on saudi bondsthe brent futures curve has flattened significantly and goldman argues that for spot prices to rise the futures curve will have to move back into a stronger backwardation a situation in which prices trade at a premium to oil futures
the good news for oil prices it that the current data does not justify the recent and sudden flattening of the curve goldman analysts argue

or decides not to cut at all at the upcoming meeting which leads to a significant supply glut heading into out over the next year s problems get even trickier
they could decide to flood the market which would likely crash prices but that would crush their own budgets
meanwhile shale is poised to add a flood of new supply next year
as bloomberg notes the shale industry has already vastly exceeded expectations in and shale companies have not slowed down
they are drilling new wells now but only completing some of them
e ps are keeping some wells uncompleted awaiting new pipelines in
when those projects come online another wave of fresh supply could be unleashed
we re going to see a of well completions in the permian in the second half of corey prologo head of oil trading in houston at commodity merchant trafigura group told bloomberg
the pipelines are going to fill up very could decide to cut output in december to stop the slide in oil prices
