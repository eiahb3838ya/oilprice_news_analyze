a rare state of affairs for refiners
the global oil market appears to be even as the production cuts begin to whittle away at excess barrels
but while crude may be ample there are growing problems within the market for refined products including an emerging glut of bottom line is that gasoline supply is surging while the market for other products is tightening up
there are multiple reasons for this
first the crude slate itself is helping to create these imbalances
the surge of shale production has made the global crude mix lighter and sweeter
light sweet oil tends to produce relatively more gasoline when it is refined
medium and heavier oils produce more diesel and other middle distillates and less output has surged in recent years leaving refiners with more crudes to process
at the same time because of skyrocketing shale production is backing out barrels in order to avoid a glut of crude
but many producers within the cartel churn out medium and heavy barrels
so light oil from shale is surging while medium and heavier barrels are being held are a few more factors driving the divergence in the crude slate
venezuela has been suffering from steep declines for well over a year
the south american opec member produces heavy oil
any unexpected outage in venezuela due to unfolding political crisis there would magnify these trends
mexico another heavy oil producer has seen its output deteriorate for years albeit at a more gradual pace than venezuela
iran too is losing supply
related the most important oil factor in the upshot is that light oil from shale has surged at a time that heavier producers from elsewhere have suffered declines
heavier and sour crudes which have historically traded at a discount are seeing upward pricing pressure
sour crude prices are strong because the west is net short sour crude a trader told s p global effect on the products markets is even starker prices for gasoline are slumping but those for diesel and other distillates are trading at a premium
while refiners can tweak their inputs somewhat there are limits to how they adjust to the changing mix of crude
some refiners are simply more equipped to handle heavier oils others can handle lighter as product prices go haywire refiners are trying to ramp up supplies of diesel and other distillates
but with more diesel comes more gasoline
refiners can t simply produce one without the other
as a result as refiners chase diesel barrels they are dumping more gasoline onto the global market exacerbating the emerging gasoline glut keeps getting worse investment bank jefferies said in a note on last week saw gasoline stocks reach their highest level since records began so it comes as no surprise that crack spreads for gasoline are under pressure commerzbank wrote in a note on friday
crack spreads in the us are at a low of just per barrel while in europe they are even european refiners are having trouble finding a home for their gasoline bloomberg reports

the international maritime organization imo has rules on marine fuels that take effect at the start of
those rules require ships to cut the concentration of sulfur in their fuels significantly
that means that ships will have to stop running on heavy fuel oil which is high in sulfur
to replace dirtier fuels many ships will switch to middle distillates
that may ease the pressure on heavier sour oils but it could also put even more pressure on diesel and gasoil another distillate some point refiners may not be able to take on more light oil as they reach a limit
if you analyze the refining system of the world they are designed to take a certain percentage of light crude that can not be changed dramatically pedro antonio merino garcia chief economist at repsol said at the argus americas crude summit in houston that means refiners may have to curtail processing rates which would undercut demand for crude oil potentially pushing crude oil prices nick cunningham of top reads from
