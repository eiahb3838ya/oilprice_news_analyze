chinese solar giant: “the party is definitely over”
just like in most things energy related including crude oil imports natural gas and lng imports coal usage and even nuclear power china s massive population and its economic heft also extends far and wide into global solar markets
china is the largest in the world home to almost a third of the world s cumulative installed solar capacity of around gw far greater than the at around gw and japan roughly last summer the chinese government pulled state support for solar power companies
beijing indicated at the time the curtailment was aimed at promoting the solar energy sector s sustainable development enhancing its development quality and speeding up reduction of the move caught many by surprise but may best be explained at least in part as beijing s response to a percent tariff put in place last year on chinese solar equipment by president trump
the president s decision was a response to several american solar companies claim that china solar subsidies were allowing its solar companies to undercut solar up reformby september even as trade relations between the and china worsened beijing sought to speed up its efforts to ensure its wind and solar power sectors could compete without subsidies and achieve what new energy regulatory draft guidelines called grid price parity with traditional energy sources like coal
all the while china needs a strong solar sector as beijing tries to diversify its energy mix away from dirty burning coal used for power generation to renewables as well as natural gas and lng the cleanest burning fossil support for solar on such a massive scale not only brought concern from foreign solar manufacturers but was also a large burden on state coffers that ran in to the billions of dollars annually
just by china owned some billion in subsidies to solar companies
beijing s withdrawal of support caused global solar panel prices to fall around percent last year a boon for companies that needed to invest in solar infrastructure but caused headwinds for manufacturers especially some smaller manufactures in china that almost went bankrupt

the subsidies came into force in december for a period of three years and were extended further than the original deadline
china s commerce ministry said at the time that the move restored trade of photovoltaics to a normal market condition and provided a more stable and predictable business environment for cooperation between the two party is overnow a major chinese solar player eric luo president of china s gcl system integration technology co a maker of solar panels said yesterday at the world economic forum in davos that the global solar power industry is about to lose a major competitive windfall as prices for chinese solar panels are poised to recover from a price plunge last the party if definitely over he added that solar panel prices were already stabilizing and that he expected them to rebound by to percent as the chinese industry consolidates over the next year or two
