oil prices rebound after eia reports another large crude draw
amid emerging doubts that opec and russia have outdone themselves with the oil production cuts and are starting to suffer the consequences the energy information administration reported another large draw in oil inventories this week
at million barrels the draw is significant enough to support a further price rise for wti
yesterday the american petroleum institute reported yet another draw of million barrels keeping spirits high
analysts expected the eia to report its ninth straight weekly inventory draw with a reuters poll setting the size of the draw at million barrels the same as last week s analyst poll by platts showed
in gasoline the eia reported another build of million barrels for the week to january
that s compared to a build in the prior week
production of the fuel averaged million bpd last week up from million bpd in the week to january
last week the eia shook markets with the latest edition of its energy outlook in which the authority forecast oil production would reach million barrels daily this year and rise further to million bpd in late
this has not affected prices negatively however as supply continues to tighten according to observers
related are hedge funds pushing oil prices too high as a result two banks have already raised their price targets for oil for this year
bofa said it had revised its supply and demand forecast for the year and now expected a deficit of bpd versus an earlier one of bpd
as a result bofa now expects brent crude to average us a barrel and wti to hover around us a barrel
that s up from us and us a barrel respectively
some analysts are warning that in this environment opec and russia may reconsider their cut strategy for this year and agree to phase the deal out earlier than the december expiry date
that s because higher oil prices are making their oil less competitive especially with the nice discount wti traditionally enjoys to brent and crude blends tied to it
at the time of writing wti was trading at us a barrel and brent was changing hands at us a barrel
