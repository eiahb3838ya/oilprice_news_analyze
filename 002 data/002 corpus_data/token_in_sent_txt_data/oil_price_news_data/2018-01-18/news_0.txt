peak oil demand is a slow-motion train wreck
will oil demand peak within five years
years
or not until or the precise date at which oil demand hits a high point and then enters into decline has been the subject of much debate and a topic that has attracted a lot of interest just in the last few years
consumption levels in some parts of the world have already begun to stagnate and more and more automakers have begun to ratchet up their plans for electric the exact date the world will hit peak demand kind of misses the whole point argues a new report which is notable since it is coauthored by bp s chief economist spencer dale along with bassam fattouh the director of the oxford institute for energy argue that the focus shouldn t be on the date at which oil demand peaks but rather the fact that the peak is coming at all
the significance of peak oil is that it signals a shift from an age of perceived scarcity to an age of abundance they wrote
in other words oil won t be on the only game in town when it comes to fueling the global transportation system which will have consequences for oil producers and consumers exact date is unknowable and in any event the year in which the world does hit peak consumption won t result in some abrupt discontinuity of behavior the report argues
demand growth will slow and then decline but probably won t fall off a cliff
so the exact date of peak oil demand is not particularly nevertheless the implications of a looming peak in oil consumption are massive
without an economic transformation or at least serious diversification nations that depend on oil revenues for both economic growth and to finance public spending face an uncertain global clean energy investments near highand slowing demand growth is occurring at a time when supply is less of a concern than it used to be in large part because new drilling technologies have led to a wave of supply from shale
the world isn t going to run out of oil
rather it seems increasingly likely that significant amounts of recoverable oil will never be extracted the authors of the more intriguing conclusions from the report is that this new age of abundance could alter behavior from oil producers
in the past some countries notably opec members restrained output husbanding resources for the future betting that scarcity would increase the value of their holdings over time
a high ratio implying a country could continue producing oil at the same rate for years was a sign of both strength and intergenerational fairness the report looking forward if a peak in demand looms just over the horizon oil producers could rush to maximize their production in order to get as much value for their reserves while they can
better to have money in the bank than oil in the to complicate matters further maximizing production to fight for market share would require hundreds of billions of dollars of investment
for instance rystad energy predicts upstream spending will stand at billion in which is sharply lower than in years past
huge sums will be required even just to maintain current levels of creates another problem
as the ft notes extending the life of oil fields let alone investing in new ones will require marshalling such large volumes of capital but that might be met with skepticism from wary investors when demand begins to peak
when that shift occurs from a growing industry to one in decline you change investors perception jason bordoff at columbia university s center on global energy policy told the ft
it will be difficult to attract investment to a shrinking industry particularly if margins continued to get squeezed
in in that sense the timing of peak oil demand does in fact way peak demand should be an alarming prospect for opec russia the oil majors basically any and all oil producers who will find themselves fighting more aggressively for a shrinking pie
faced with the possibility that significant amounts of recoverable oil may never be extracted producers have a strong incentive to use their comparative advantage to squeeze out producers and gain market share just as with any other competitive market dale and fattouh wrote
oil producers will need to adapt to a higher volume lower price environment
for consumers however the shift will bring benefits including more options and cheaper energy
related what s the limit for permian oil production at the country level this is scary stuff
many oil producers have hefty spending requirements to satisfy their populaces including for healthcare housing employment etc
ample global oil supply for the foreseeable future combined with an eventual peak in demand threatens persistent fiscal deficits and some hard arabia has offered up its vision which the report by dale and fattouh say is probably the most prominent example of a major oil producer responding to the changing environment but economic transformations are incredibly difficult and would conceivably take decades to pull s hard to imagine countries that depend on oil for more than percent of their export revenue adapting well it s a train wreck
dale and fattouh say it may require an eventual adjustment in living standards which is a rather diplomatic way of putting nick cunningham of top reads from
