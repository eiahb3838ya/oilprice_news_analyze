sanctions on iran may send oil prices above $90 next year
according to bank of america merrill lynch oil prices will hit a barrel by the second quarter of as iranian oil barrels are removed from the market and other supply disruption risks threaten the tightening oil united states signaled this week that it would look to take as much iranian oil as possible out of the market with the renewed sanctions on saudi arabia and russia had opec and allies pledge last week to ease compliance rates in other words to boost production by an unspecified number production increases will make the global spare capacity thinner at a time of low inventories setting the stage for higher oil prices in case of additional supply disruptions analysts we are in a very attractive oil price environment and our house view is that oil will hit by the end of the second quarter of next year hootan yazhari head of frontier markets equity research at bank of america merrill lynch told we are moving into an environment where supply disruptions are visible all over the and of course president trump has been pretty active in trying to isolate iran and getting allies not to purchase oil from iran yazhari with inventories still declining and spare capacity uncomfortably low there is very little cushion for any supply disruption caused by rising geopolitical risks anz bank told before opec s meeting last week the international energy agency iea many there would be some sort of production increase
but even if the iran and venezuela supply gap is to be plugged the market will be finely balanced next year and vulnerable to prices rising higher in the event of further disruption the agency said in its oil market report in eia defines spare capacity as the volume of production that can be brought on within days and sustained for at least days
related the demand downside for oil pricesopec has lost around bpd in production since september with venezuela accounting for about of that michael haigh managing director and global head of commodities research at societe generale told bloomberg this meaningful spare capacity in the world is in just four s saudi arabia the uae and kuwait and s russia according to haigh
while saudi arabia claims that it has million bpd of spare capacity socgen thinks that it s more like million million bpd
kuwait and the uae combined probably have another bpd and russia around are now low and spare capacity is declining haigh iranian oil supply may have been the leading theme in oil markets this week but venezuela s production continues to crumble with socgen estimating that it would drop by another bpd between now and opec s next regular meeting in early december renewed tension in libya is threatening to turn into yet another meaningful oil supply disruption
amid low inventories and sparse spare capacity as saudis and russians boost production another supply shock would not be well received analysts decline of spare capacity leaves pricing risk more exposed to the upside brian singer managing director at goldman sachs told bloomberg this earlier this week trump administration officials confirmed that they basically want to take all iranian exports off the market
this raises the prospect of an even higher loss than
with saudi pledging a million there will be little spare capacity to deal with any additional outages according to helima croft managing director and global head of commodity strategy global research at rbc capital markets and an atlantic council board director
related oil exports overtake opec s number told cnbc this week that the sanctions on iran are incredibly coercive and that more than million bpd of iranian oil would be taken out of the for any corporate that wants to do business in the united states they will drop their ties with iran she and russians may be boosting production but the risk is that we can not afford another supply disruption if we have such thin spare capacity shock absorbers croft key question for the oil market going forward will not be how much russia and the the close saudi allies such as the uae and pump to plug supply losses but how much spare capacity this would leave to absorb additional supply disruptions
