what peak oil demand, copper and 3d printing have in common
the debate about peak oil demand pod will likely rage on for quite some time
years ago peak oil theories on production and supply were constantly thrown around for general consumption
there was even an association for the study of peak oil
it seemed to culminate with the release of syriana in staring george clooney and matt damon
a few years later the shale revolution began and economic potential of other large unconventional assets like alberta s oil sands entered public view
many peak oil supply and production theories were put to rest because oil is much more abundant and economically accessible than originally fiasco of peak oil theories showed the need to point a critical eye to underlying assumptions of crafted narratives about future energy markets
it would be a mistake to do the same with pod
there are serious questions about the nature of pod and the supposed transition away from greenhouse gas ghg intensive fuels that need to be explored
so please ponder the following copper producers effectively supply electrification of the transportation sector in the coming decades rio tinto emr capital and bmo capital markets have all expressed concern about copper supply in the coming decades
earlier this year cru analyst hamish sampson provided a stark supply outlook stating that only if every single copper project currently in development or being studied for feasibility is brought online before then including most discoveries that have not yet reached the evaluation stage the market could meet projected the forecast suggests that copper production could plummet from current levels of roughly million metric tons per year to just million in
two hundred copper mines are expected to reach their productive by
related oil increased investment or demand destruction even though copper is highly recyclable new production is required due to an increasing global population and the fact it is trapped in end uses like piping and wiring for decades
what does this have to do with pod
potentially lots
for example if the appropriate charging infrastructure can not be built demand for electric vehicles evs could be stunted for years
afterall if individual consumers and businesses can not have a predictable easily accessible way to power their vehicles at a price why would they purchase a ev
in addition evs require significantly more copper a conventional vehicles contains up to kilograms whereas hybrids and only evs require up to and kilograms this is why shinzuo abe toyota s powertrain general manager is skeptical of evs making a major breakthrough before
without the proper charging infrastructure in place the market can not adopt them unless direct solar powered evs like the sion make a significant splash in the market
however it remains to be seen whether solar powered vehicles can be made practical enough to be globally there is also the fact that in mining discovery to production lead times have increased substantially in last two decades
between and leads times hovered around years
between and lead times were not less that years
less ideal geology is considered one major factor as the highly quality deposits are becoming scarcer
of course if vehicles like the sion become viable enough it could offset of the demand for charging infrastructure
we shall wait and not used for refined fuels how much oil will be pushed into other markets supply chains connect industries
however resource inputs to supply chains often compete with each other
supply chains evolve in part as demands of end users change
in for example vehicles contained a lot more metals than they currently do
auto manufacturers have gradually increased the proportion of plastics to metals
cost fuel efficiency and customer preferences have made it practical for auto manufactures to do so
that trend appears to continue as printed cars like the lsev enter mass production in the coming traders turn bullish ahead of iran sanctionsif oil isn t being refined into fuels it may open the door for uses in other parts of the market that are inefficient and expensive
afterall could there not be opportunities from a potential abundance of cheap petrochemical feedstock
possibly
could it give manufacturers and builders a reason to ponder their supply chain inputs and to rejig to cheaper more effective inputs
simple internet search will generate pages of printing applications including replacement dog skulls guns homes furniture door handles shoes and faucets
uptake of additive manufacturing is underway and implications for individual consumers and manufacturers could be substantial
although materials that comprise printed objects are highly varied oil and natural inputs are significant
oil producers would be more than happy to see their products enter new supply chains via petrochemicals and through printing
if it s not being used as a fuel it could go elsewhere
after all the global population is increasing
so too are the resource needs of emerging economies
petrochemicals will play a major part in resourcing these peak oil production and supply theories it is very important to challenge carefully crafted narratives about pod by asking the right questions and finding evidence to answer these questions
will there be enough copper
how much can fuel efficiency improve in the coming decades
where else can oil go
there are others
lots of them
the world may only be a few years away from getting more substantive answers about pod
perhaps it s a good time to make a movie about it by justin ziebart from top reads from
