expect a bounce in wti prices
we are still in a period of headline risk in financial markets generally
stocks bonds and currencies are all reacting to news on subjects as diverse as trade north korea and italian politics
neither italian political turmoil nor an on again off again relationship with north korea are anything new but the prospect of an escalating trade war has traders in every market bond and currency markets are reacting as you might expect with the year yield falling and the dollar gaining ground as the trade gathers pace
click to enlarge both have seen a bounce off obvious levels for the dollar index and for year yields but for now the trends remain are a different story
equities are holding up remarkably well and remain close to the top of an upward recovery channel that has been in place since april
the feeling seems to be that healthy corporate profits and reasonably strong economic data trump if you ll forgive the pun the headline risks
click to enlarge geopolitics as always geopolitical risk as it relates to oil is focused on the middle east
the trump administration seems to have picked a side in the ongoing conflict between saudi arabia and iran increasing the risk of the proxy wars between the two rivals in yemen and syria growing into open warfare
however with the saudis now getting support they will probably be content to wait and see the effects of renewed sanctions and as this article at posits that also makes aggression from iran far less in all more simmering looks more likely than a full so the upward pressure on oil that we have seen recently from the middle east will fade into the background for a situation in europe brings on a sense of déjà vu
it is eerily reminiscent of when the many announcements of the death of the european union were somewhat premature
there is some risk here but history suggests that this too shall the geopolitical situation in the middle east has of course been a major factor in supply considerations in recent days and while that has influenced wti on several occasions the main upward push has been in brent
even more fuel has been added to that by the opec led cuts in production have remained in place despite some reports of problems
related goldman the oil price rally isn t over yetat the same time six weeks of gains in the north american rig count and the conventional wisdom that and canadian production are being or will be ramped up to compensate for reduced global supply
in reality though the rig count steadied last week after six weeks of gains and the eia numbers showed a larger than expected draw on the potential effects of a trade war loom large
the effectiveness of the opec led production cuts has been magnified by the improving prospects for global growth and that is now at risk
however this too comes under the category of headline risk
consistency has not been a hallmark of the trump administration so far and there have already been several changes of tone of the tariff issue
another could easily prompt a quick reversal in factors
