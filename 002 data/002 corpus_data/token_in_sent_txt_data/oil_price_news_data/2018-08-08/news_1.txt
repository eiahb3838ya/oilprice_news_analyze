is this europe’s newest oil & gas producer?
few countries have a hydrocarbon history as difficult and convoluted as portugal
it has lost its colonies just as angola s oil production was on the brink of multiplying later even mozambique turned out to be a superb region with giant fields like rovuma
currently portugal has no oil production whatsoever perhaps a noteworthy reminder that the progenitor of the leading portuguese oil company galp energia was established specifically for the purposes of exploration and production in africa not in europe
recently a new spark of activity has generated substantial buzz in portugal entertaining a hope that there might in fact be oil in portugal yet the prospects of it being produced commercially still look media hype reached its apex in when a british company named ioniq resources has stated it had located six deposits in portugal with reserves totaling at least billion barrels
government officials were prudent in their managing of public expectations for a good reason despite having no production whatsoever upstream activities in portuguese waters are a heated political subject
the portuguese green party as well as the left bloc bloco de esquerda upon the support of which the government depends are fiercely opposing any form of activity whilst the communists oppose foreign companies participation in exploiting resources which they deem to be far antónio costa s government has done a fairly good job of keeping fiscal stability and economic growth since the economy keeps on expanding underpinned by a high gdp increase of percent in
oil could potentially boost portugal s economic standing further however in view of the difficulties of keeping a viable government the development of new fields has been stalled
on may the costa government issued a temporary moratorium on the allocation of future oil gas concessions in the country covering not only the onshore part but also perhaps unexpectedly the offshore
despite giving in to political pressures the authorities found a partial way out by exempting blocks that are held by a joint venture of eni and galp as well as sparing them the inconvenience of additional environmental impact studies
related oil falls despite crude inventory drawthe overarching fear of those against any sort of drilling is that it will transform the nation to the worse oil rigs would taint the pristine beaches of portugal that tourists are increasingly fond of and bring about environmental damage not seen before
adding insult to injury for oil enthusiasts portugal has become a leading voice in the sphere of renewables especially with regard to wind energy twh produced in
in total renewables now account for percent of the country s electricity consumption boasting noteworthy achievements like running exclusively on renewables for days in a row
for many developing oil deposits would be tantamount to compromising past successes in energy when eni s santola well will be drilled this september it will run against several currents
yet there is plenty room for optimism too eni and galp affirm that the alentejo basin shares many similarities source rock geological structure to the canadian grand banks offshore of newfoundland
further still exploration drilling has a long tradition in portugal with shell exxonmobil then esso and chevron texaco spudding intensively in
most of the wells drilled in the past were onshore or in shallow waters to the north of the alentejo basin where most of future drilling will supposedly take place
in fact the alentejo basin has witnessed only two wells spudded both quite a distance away from will be spudded in a water depth of some from the portuguese coast the operator distinctly points out that the rig will not be seen from the coastline most likely using the saipem drillship previously used in morocco
if santola finds commercial quantities of oil things might get difficult for drillers algarve is portugal s foremost tourist destination annually attracting more than million people and generating billions of income
local campaign groups have been very vocal about their having zero tolerance towards offshore drilling citing the catastrophic oil spill of tanker mv prestige off the coast of galicia
at the same time portugal s offshore is a massive uncharted territory for explorers thanks to its islands in the atlantic ocean azores madeira etc
portugal has the largest exclusive economic zone in the world so this might be only the first step in an marathon

wielding kbpd of processing capacity at the sines and matosinhos refineries which were recently upgraded to a nelson complexity of portugal has turned into a net product exporter
in percent of the mt of oil products refined mt went to exports supplied mostly to spain france and the united states
moreover domestic market development are also of considerable interest bunker fuel and jet fuel demand have demonstrated growth last year up by percent and percent respectively as commercial activity is intensifying on the back of a recovering economy
a stable supply of jet fuel will be essential for the portuguese energy sector as the government is intent to commission lisbon s second international airport in montijo in is also important to note the role eni has played in pushing forward projects in offshore zones previously thought to be ones
having brought mozambique onto the world lng market with the mamba and coral gas finds in buttressed by the offshore mediterranean s gas find zohr in eni has become one of the most successful offshore actors out there
a potential portuguese success might be the icing on the cake for the italian company
it would also cost many sleepless nights for portuguese politicians for whom conjoining the interests of the tourism industry and the country s oil sector might be a real viktor katona for top reads from
