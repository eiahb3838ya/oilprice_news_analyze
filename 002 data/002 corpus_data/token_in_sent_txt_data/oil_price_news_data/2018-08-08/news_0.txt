eia: u.s. oil production growth is slowing
the eia just revised down its forecast for oil production growth for an acknowledgement that pipeline constraints are slowing output gains in the permian eia believes the will average million barrels per day this year down from last month s estimate
it also revised down its forecast for next year s average output to down from downward revision comes after recently released data from the agency suggested that output growth during this past spring was not as robust as previously thought
the eia at the time thought shale production continued to grow at a blistering rate with production rising by over bpd between the beginning of april and the end of may
but more recent data suggests that production actually dipped a bit over that may seem like an insignificant revision but it points to broader problems particularly in the permian basin which could cause the to undershoot expectations going movements in the rig count lend a little more weight to this notion
while the number of rigs bounces around from week to week the overall number is essentially unchanged since may
and in the permian where all the drilling action has been concentrated the rig count stood at at the start of august no higher than it was in early the lower forecast for output this year reflects slightly slower than expected growth in middle quarters of this year possibly related to pipeline constraints out of the permian basin that have reduced wellhead prices in the region tim hess a product manager for the eia s energy outlook said according to bloomberg

in the short run the eia is much more sanguine about global supplies than other analysts
while a series of investment banks including goldman sachs and bank of america merrill lynch predict that the outages from iran could cause supplies to tighten significantly the eia says that production should keep the market adequately supplied
we continue to expect brent crude oil spot prices to fall towards per barrel by the end of as the market appears to be fairly balanced in the coming months said linda capuano eia the revisions to data from months ago raise questions about the production figures coming out on a weekly basis
right now that weekly data says that the is producing a little less than
but because those weekly figures are repeatedly revised down as time passes there is a good chance that production is not actually that high right now
other analysts say the challenges facing permian drillers are larger than just an overestimation of output
in addition to pipeline constraints drillers face other operational problems
escalating costs logistical constraints decreasing cash flows and the intensity of operations forcing a downwards move in geological quality from tier to tier locations may be just a few of the reasons for initial well productivity in the permian reaching a plateau over the past few months standard chartered wrote in a note

moreover the eia estimates that production could average in an increase of from this year
next year s increase will be smaller than this year s but it is still a very large jump in output
by the end of the eia thinks that the will be sitting just shy of to months into the future is always tricky so there will be plenty more revisions to the production figures going forward
but the latest downward revisions suggest that the array of challenges facing the shale industry which have been discussed in the media for some time are starting to show up in the nick cunningham of top reads from
