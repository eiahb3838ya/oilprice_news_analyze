alberta oil cuts to end sooner than planned
canadian crude oil is already expensive enough for the production cuts to stop making sense some producers have already started rolling them back far ahead of schedule
this is what the chief executive of one of alberta s largest oil players suncor said during a conference call about the company s latest financial unlike other canadian oil producers was against the cuts from the beginning
our position is that government intervention in the market would send the wrong signals to the investment community regarding doing business in alberta and canada
and we really do need to take a view and allow the market to operate as it should a spokeswoman for the company said when the alberta government began to consider the cuts as a remedy for the huge discount western canadian select was trading at to west texas this gap has closed faster than initially expected ceo steve williams says and now some negative unexpected consequences are making themselves the differential corrected and overcorrected very quickly and the unintended consequence of that is the potential the economics are seriously damaged and a lot of the rail movements are stopping or have stopped williams said during the conference decline in railway shipments of crude would be indeed a problem for canadian producers it is generally considered costlier than pipelines and with the oil itself becoming more expensive the cost of shipping it to refiners has risen too much for comfort it seems
as a result producers have already started winding down the cuts

these cuts were to be in place from the beginning of january until the overhang in crude oil because of the pipeline
after that the cuts would be reduced to bpd to stay in effect until the end of the effect of premier notley s announcement was immediate the price of western canadian select shot up even before the cuts entered into effect and even at that early stage this sparked the concern of some industry insiders that the cuts would have a boomerang seems to be the situation right now one month into the cuts and wcs is already so expensive that railway shipments are declining
this could bring about a return of the inventory overhang and this would in turn pressure prices again effectively sucking the industry into a vicious circle of price jumps and those involved suncor is in an almost unique position the company has a sizeable refining business as well as well as upstream operations so it benefits equally from price rises and declines
in fact despite the cuts it had already announced its plan to boost its production this year to between and bpd of crude which would be percent more than what suncor produced last other companies the situation remains grave
the production cuts were from the start conceived of as a temporary measure
temporary measures however can not solve persistent problems such as the lack of enough pipelines to carry albertan crude to irina slav for top reads from
