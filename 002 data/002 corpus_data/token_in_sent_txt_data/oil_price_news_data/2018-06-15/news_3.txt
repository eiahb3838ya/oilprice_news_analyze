who gets hold of russia’s key oil hub?
one of russia s most important oil ports the sunlit novorossiysk has become a battleground for the country companies
located in the tsemesskaya bay novorossiysk is used to stormy springs because of the northeasterm wind blowing powerfully sometimes to the point that port operations have to stop for a few days yet this spring turned out to be stormier than usual
one of novorossiysk s main owners the privately owned summa group of brothers ziyavudin and magomed magomedov will be forced to sell their stake in the company in light of their arrest and impending ascent of the summa group was as swift as will be judging by the ongoing process its downfall
the company jointly bought percent of the novorossiysk port with the transneft for billion roughly percent higher than its market price at that time palpably backed by medvedev whose government chief of staff at that time was arkadiy dvorkovich former university classmate and close friend of ziyavudin magomedov
the connection does not end there dvorkovich s wife is of dagestani descent just as the magomedovs
all in all such a beneficial state of affairs allowed summa group to build up a sprawling portfolio and become a leading voice on the russian port infrastructure the march arrest of the magomedovs ziyavudin was arrested for having set up a crime network as well as on embezzlement and fraud charges his brother was allegedly responsible for the coercive of their dealings
it is very unlikely that magomedov
on the russian forbes list will be freed from charges arrests in russia are chaotic yet the authorities would not risk fabricating charges given the already difficult situation business works in russia
moreover one of the main charges consists in the illegal appropriation of money allocated for the construction of the kaliningrad football arena where several world cup matches will be held the public at large will rather side by the federal authorities than the the oil giant that saw its cash reserves plunge thus percent of the novorossiysk commercial sea port ncsp is up for grabs
summa s partner in the percent majority owner novoport holding is the pipeline transportation monopoly transneft which owns another percent of the asset via its transneft service subsidiary
the remaining shares belong to the federal property management agency percent russian railways percent and are on the moscow and london stock exchanges percent
if transneft were to scoop up this stake it would establish itself as a dominant player in the black sea infrastructure controlling percent of the dominant port in the region
most observers thought this was inevitable transneft has declared interest in the asset moreover it has consolidated its footing in the ncsp after summa representatives were ousted from the executive board and were replaced by transneft s takeover of novorossiysk would make sense from the point of view of russian authorities for them a oil transportation giant is easier to control than a private entity
yet as has become sadly traditional in russia a sudden twist has complicated matters for all rumours have started circulating that rosneft is willing to buy summa s shares
although the company itself has warned against any provocations and disinformation in regard to rosneft and partly denied having interest in the port the phrasing was peculiar as the press statement said rosneft is not interested from buying an asset from someone under investigation if the state nationalized the percent would it become interested
oddly enough federal public servants have been keeping the rosneft claim head of the federal office igor artemiev claimed rosneft might move to get its share of the port because it needs its infrastructure to avoid being plundered
perhaps it is just a way to play it safe after rosneft swallowed up bashneft in late and carried out a rather quaint partial privatization involving cefc the chinese conglomerate that is now on the brink of going bust it became an omnipresent actor on the russian oil market
yet a potential coexistence of rosneft and transneft within one holding company is ripe with controversies just in the past few years there were several judicial proceedings between the two
most notably in late rosneft refused to sign up to transneft s annual transportation contract accusing it of excessive pipeline transportation process losses allegedly up to mtpa the conflict was solved only after minister of energy novak intervened opec s second biggest producer faces instabilityeven though this year brought no scandals it has still been replete with rows
late february transneft accused the novorossiysk port master of prioritizing rosneft s shipping interests because of which several vessels with fixtures before that of rosneft were forced to stand idle for days outside of novorossiysk
if the ncsp s ownership structure were to become another battlefield between the two things would most certainly get nastier than this
the vector of russian political power has largely boiled down to keeping close confidants equidistant and satisfied with their status all the while avoiding nasty infighting yet if one is to look at the interests of novorossiysk itself it is very likely that its consolidation under a transneft umbrella might do a lot of good to it

black sea crude export outlets novorossiysk is no longer the leading crude export outlet in the black sea having been overtaken by the caspian pipeline consortium whose throughput will skyrocket to mtpa this year
in the last years novorossiysk crude exports have fallen by percent even though other commodities such as grain have demonstrated robust growth
therefore although it seems counterintuitive for a private company to be bought up by a federal one in today s russia it might help by easing financial constraints on the development of the port due to a steady influx of money from the mother company s pipeline transportation business and bringing sudden direction switches to a minimum
it seems certainly better than a protracted limbo of views set out in this article are solely those of the author in his private viktor katona for top reads from
