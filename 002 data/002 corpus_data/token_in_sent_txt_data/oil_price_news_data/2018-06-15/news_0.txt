shale shifts attention to this ‘forgotten’ oil play
the permian has been getting most of the headlines on shale but there is another play in the vicinity that has been attracting more industry attention than media attention
pretty much forgotten since the when shale oil and gas moved to the forefront of the oil industry the austin chalk has now gotten a new lease on life it the last six months oil majors including conocophillips marathon oil and eog resources have purchased some acres in the chalk formation that runs from the border through central louisiana and into mississippi
drilling is set to begin in late
and that s not all because drillers are also returning to old fields in the recently reported that an independent player wildhorse resource development has started drilling in an old field in the chalk using technology developed for the shale plays
though the chalk is not a shale is as the name suggests made up of limestone and chalk soaked with oil and fracking tech could increase resource rigs in the austin chalk rose twofold in the past six months reuters said quoting drillinginfo data to and production grew to bpd in from just bpd five years ago
technically recoverable oil reserves stand at around billion barrels and gas reserves are estimated at trillion cu ft according to the energy information administration

well as it happens the play is not without its problems
in a recent story bloomberg s alex nissbaum noted quoting wood mackenzie that the chalk has a bad reputation with wells that start strong and then quickly dry up
that s because of the geology of the place it is highly fractured which means the geology changes quickly over short distances so you have to do a lot of geology to understand where it s going to produce a drilling industry insider told and gas production from the chalk has until now been done using conventional drilling methods
now fracking tech is being applied to the formation with drillers seeing long horizontal wells combined with steerable drilling and the injection of sand and chemicals mixtures improving recovery fact thanks to the application of this technology some test wells in the chalk are already outperforming shale wells
wildhorse for example says some of its newly drilled wells in the chalk produced three times more than the initial output from comparable eagle ford wells
eog also said its austin chalk wells yielded over two times more than a new well in the there is the fact of the chalk s proximity to the gulf coast refiners and the fact that land is still cheap
this combination of factors could bring it into the spotlight to rival the permian especially when we throw in the fact that parts of the chalk are overlapping with the eagle ford play meaning that drillers in these parts could tap the oil and gas from more than one formation
given all that we will probably be hearing more about the chalk in the coming irina slav for top reads from
