oil demand growth could start to soften soon
opec may tout the production cuts pact as the key driver of oil market rebalancing but if it weren t for the strong global oil demand growth of the past three years we wouldn t have seen international agencies calling the end of the oil was strong because the oil prices between and stimulated consumption growth in both mature oecd economies like the united states and most of western europe and in emerging and india in oil importing nations benefited from the lower oil prices but while demand growth in india and china is largely driven by economic expansion and industrial activity in oecd economies demand is more closely linked with large and sustained changes in oil prices
the rally in oil prices since the middle of last year is expected to moderate growth in the more oecd economies reuters market analyst john kemp demand will continue to increase largely driven by markets like china and india but the higher oil prices could slacken the pace of the oecd demand growth that could curb global oil demand growth
last year oil demand grew by million to the growth and well above the average of some million bpd bp said in its bp statistical review of world energy published this not surprisingly oil demand in continued to be driven by oil importers benefitting from the windfall of low prices with both europe and the us posting notable increases compared with average declines over the previous years bp in closer to its average according to the can saudi arabia prevent the next oil shock but there were some signs in the product mix that the boost from low oil prices may be beginning to wane

one of the lessons we ve learned over the last few years is that oil demand does respond to pricing the international energy agency iea cut in may its estimate for global oil demand growth by bpd to million bpd because of rising although underlying demand remains strong the iea thinks that with nearly jump in oil prices since june it would be extraordinary if such a large jump did not affect demand growth especially as user subsidies have been reduced or cut in several emerging economies in recent in the june oil market report out this week the iea kept its growth forecast unchanged issuing its estimate for demand million bpd
downside risks to that projection include higher prices a weakening of economic confidence trade protectionism and a potential further strengthening of the us related bpd offline following clashes in libyawhile demand growth is mostly underpinned by emerging economies and the trend is demand rising for years to come the mature and more oecd economies start to see more moderate growth in gasoline demand for in point gasoline consumption growth in the united states was bpd in and bpd in years in which oil prices were at their lowest during the slump according to eia data analyzed by reuters kemp
