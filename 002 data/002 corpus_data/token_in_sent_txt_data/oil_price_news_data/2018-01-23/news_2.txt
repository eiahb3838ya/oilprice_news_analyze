largest oil consumers not in a rush to hedge crude
four major airlines have said they have no plans to hedge fuel deliveries despite higher oil prices
these include delta american united and dubai s emirates
this may suggest the airlines do not believe the current price increase will be a resilient one
on the other hand for at least one of the airlines it s just how they do we have not hedged since the merger and our philosophy has not changed
we are the largest purchaser of jet fuel and we think we would be bidding against ourselves
the market is quite thin beyond months said american airlines managing director and assistant treasurer amelia anderson speaking at a panel during the airline economics conference in s ceo tony fernandes shares the sentiment
in a bloomberg interview he said that after airlines have had to deal with wti at over us a barrel wti at us is still a honeymoon fernandes added that the airline is not worried about the future price developments because of the strong shale production the oil demand outlook and the gas demand comments of the airline executives come on the heels of imf s latest world economic outlook which forecast the world s economy will grow by percent a upward revision
