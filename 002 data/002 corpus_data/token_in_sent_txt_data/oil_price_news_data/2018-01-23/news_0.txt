the biggest year yet for u.s. shale
shale companies are expected to ramp up production this year and higher oil prices could lead to the industry turning profits for the first years the shale promise has been hollow
even when oil prices were trading above per barrel most shale drillers weren t profitable
they drilled rapidly brought huge volumes of production online in short order and upended the global oil market
any cash they recouped they ploughed back into the ground
the debt taken on to drill new wells was made on the assumption that future growth would translate into bigger earnings and like any industry growing quickly wall street was quick to pour money into evermore spending has vastly outpaced earnings
according to the wall street journal the shale industry has spent billion more than it has generated since collapse of oil prices forced a deep contraction with lots of defaults layoffs and bankruptcies
there was a period of time when wall street was lured back in on the promise of lower breakeven costs and substantial efficiency profits still proved to be elusive
only last year did major investors start demanding big changes
that led to shale executives committing to a more prudent and strategy which called for more conservative drilling programs and an emphasis on cash and profits over oil prices suddenly and unexpectedly higher compared to just a few months ago the shale industry could quite possibly have its cake and eat it too
the wsj notes that the industry has all the ingredients it needs for to be a profitable one a first for the industry
that could occur simultaneously with enormous volumes of fresh supply

an analysis by jeffries finds that a group of small shale companies are planning on increasing spending this year by a modest percent a sign of restraint after hiking spending by percent last oil prices are sharply higher right now than they were last year granting an unexpected windfall to the industry
on top of that a lot of drillers are sitting on drilled but uncompleted wells ducs which basically means that some of the costs have already been accounted for
if some of those wells are completed this year it will lead to a rush of new supply without a huge spending increase
the duc list nearly hit in december up more than percent from the start of isn t all smooth sailing however particularly if explosive shale growth undercuts prices
but is shaping up to be the brightest year yet for shale
there is always a risk that they will shoot themselves in the foot again john castellano managing director in the energy practice of consulting firm alixpartners told the wsj
but unlike in the past this time around the companies have much lower costs better balance sheets better management teams and more room to the eia expects the to top million barrels per day for the first time ever next month with production averaging for
output will then surge above by the end of the agency predicts

argus media reports that the permian where much of the shale growth will be concentrated could face pipeline bottlenecks at some point in late or
while there is ample room right now producers are going to run into another wall for infrastructure capacity robert barnes the head of commercial crude for magellan said at the argus americas crude summit in houston
that sentiment was echoed by brent secrest of enterprise product partners who said that at some point there is going to be a day of but for the next few quarters at least shale companies could enjoy some of their best numbers ever
and because share prices performed so poorly last year and still lag the broader increase in crude prices analysts see huge potential for energy nick cunningham of top reads from
