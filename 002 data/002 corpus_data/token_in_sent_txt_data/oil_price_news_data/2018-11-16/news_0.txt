oil prices may have reached a bottom
last friday oil prices fell for the consecutive day
according to cnbc this marked the longest losing streak for crude oil in have covered the factors behind this drop in the previous two articles
to recap the loss of china as an export market for oil producers has caused crude inventories in the to swell and the trump administration s weakening of imminent sanctions on iran have both been large factors in the badiali senior research analyst at banyan hill thinks the decline is now overdone
matt says that from april to september iran cut of exports
but saudi arabia and the expanded production by more than that so the world didn t feel the pinch
as matt explained to me my research showed that during the to iran sanctions many of the asian countries cut back on iranian oil imports
china included
those countries cut about of iranian exports
that demand didn t go away it was filled by the and saudi arabia
then the government issued waivers to most of iran s oil trading partners
now that those same countries got waivers they are buying iranian crude a glut of oil on the market
i agree that the demand hasn t declined
supply particularly from the is said i am very skeptical that the saudi s can maintain this level of production
it s only about below their highest production in the last decade and they only maintained that level of output for a few months before cutting back
i believe that the market still has a drop in demand priced in
that seems wrong
i believe this will be the low oil price for the next to michael bertuccio president ceo of energy also noted that refinery maintenance may be contributing to the perception of an oversupplied market i believe there may be more immediate and drivers to oil prices falling particularly the west texas intermediate wti cash market in cushing oklahoma
this is refinery maintenance season
of the million barrels per day of refining capacity in padd percent has been the biggest threat to dollar dominanceit is far more transparent in the physical oil basis markets where we have seen midland trading plus per barrel under wti
however houston ship channel meh is trading closer to brent which is currently plus barrel over wti
add a stronger and strengthening dollar to the equation and i see this as nothing more than a price michael agrees that global demand remains chinese demand
he believes exports will accelerate with upcoming pipeline infrastructure and the wide basis spreads will compress towards brent which is a better benchmark of global oil thing is for certain
oil prices are on sale relative to where they were a month ago
it appears unlikely to me that a continued decline is supported by fundamentals especially if the stops granting waivers on iranian oil imports in six months as is the stated robert rapiermore top reads from
