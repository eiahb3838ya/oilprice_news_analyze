will the ‘next permian’ ever be developed?
the vaca muerta shale basin in argentina is the only unconventional play outside of north america where activity has already made the transition from exploration to development
the potential prize is huge geographically the vaca muerta shale is three times the size of the highly prolific permian basin in the us and it could turn out to be the next permian if the right conditions are established
but much remains to be done before that energy s shale intel group in collaboration with luxmath consulting has released a comprehensive new report covering all aspects of the vaca muerta shale including development status production forecasts drilling and completion projections and the outlook for the various service segments in the industry
the report integrates rystad energy s research for argentina public disclosures from oil gas companies and service contractors active in the region and our conversations with field experts

in addition investments need to be made in water transportation infrastructure as drilling and completions increase within the region says ryan carbrey senior vice president of shale research at rystad muerta should see the tally of fracked wells reach between and this year
only three of those wells are vertical while all other wells are horizontal completions
it is expected that fracking activity will grow at a rate of per year from through reaching about wells in
according to rystad energy research this heightened activity will generate a significant boost in vaca muerta oil production from about bpd in the third quarter of to between and bpd in the fourth quarter of
most of this growth will come from the loma campana portion of the play operated by ypf

initial oil production results look very promising and fully competitive with typical design wells in core areas of key us liquid basins like bakken and central eagle ford
we haven t yet seen performance levels to match the basin but further optimization of well designs will surely lead to additional improvements in vaca muerta says artem abramov head of shale research at rystad areas in the play already compete with the best us shale gas reservoirs
ypf s performance in the el orejano area tecpetrol s in fortin de piedra and both bp s and total s results in aguada pichana all exhibit gas well productivity on par with the core areas of the utica haynesville and marcellus shale basins in the are six active service companies currently providing pressure pumping services in vaca muerta collectively supplying about horsepower for hydraulic fracturing operations
thus far however most of these service providers have struggled to achieve acceptable margins in argentina
improving the return on investment for key service providers will be a vital issue to be addressed by operators in order to achieve their goal of attracting new investments into the demand is increasing rapidly in vaca muerta and rystad energy expects to see growth rates of about per year in reaching million tons of proppant in

on the supply side proppant is in fact the biggest immediate bottleneck in vaca muerta as trucking distances are upwards of km at times
we expect some brownfield mine expansions along with investments into mines
this will bring total sand supply from tons in to million tons in says thomas jacob lead proppant market analyst at rystad rystad energymore top reads from
