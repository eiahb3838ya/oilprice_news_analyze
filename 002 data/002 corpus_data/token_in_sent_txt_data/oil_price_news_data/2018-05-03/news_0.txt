higher oil prices are opec’s only concern
opec could achieve its goal of eliminating the oil inventory surplus this month
but the goal posts will now move to another metric in order to justify keeping the production limits in place in order to drive prices of february the oecd commercial stocks stood at million barrels just million barrels above the average
that data came from the iea s april oil market report which publishes the inventory data on a lag
because we are largely looking through the rearview mirror at the inventory data the stock surplus could be zeroed out this month the iea said although we won t know for a few more precise moment when inventories reach the average opec s stated goal as part of its production cut agreement is a bit beside the point
whether it occurs in may or june doesn t matter all that much
the most important thing is that the surplus is virtually eliminated well before opec s agreement is set to expire
refined product stocks are actually already in a deficit relative to the average
the agreement was thought to last until the end of but that remains in flux
opec officials have signaled that they want to keep the cuts in place regardless of what the inventories are actually doing right now and that there is very little chance that the group takes action in june to phase out the agreement early
the coordinated cuts could even be extended into on what basis
because the inventory metric will soon be obsolete opec is scrambling for another justification
earlier this year the group hinted at a few possible alternatives
perhaps the group could use the average for inventories instead of the average
presumably that would require keeping the current cuts in place because the past seven years incorporates a period of time in which inventories were recently however saudi oil minister khalid has pointed to low levels of upstream investment
he argues that since the oil market downturn began in industry investment has cratered and has yet to bounce back in a major way
that is raising the odds that the oil market faces a supply crunch in a few years a conclusion repeatedly echoed by the is the most important metric for evaluating next steps for opec recently it is interesting that the most powerful oil minister from within opec is pointing to investment levels as some sort of justification for keeping the current production cuts in place
says that by driving oil prices higher it will stimulate more one could be forgiven for questioning the motivation behind that
for one investment levels as a gauge of oil market health is a rather subjective metric
at what level is spending sufficient
and when will we get there second it isn t obvious that it is in opec s interest to stimulate a ton of investment in supply
after all opec has been ceding market share to other producers for a while now it isn t clear that stoking higher levels of shale drilling is really a good thing as far as opec is some analysts argue that the spending shortfall is overstated
over the next years we see that supply will continue to keep up with demand growth said espen erlingsen an analyst at rystad energy according to bloomberg
the surge in north american shale activity and start up of new fields are the main drivers for this related iran sanctions could throw oil markets into chaosso why talk about investment levels
perhaps is using oil industry spending as a pretext to keep the current production cuts in place to simply drive oil prices higher
saudi arabia has some very strong reasons to pursue higher prices regardless of inventories or investment levels
the kingdom wants to close a fiscal deficit and it also needs revenues for the economic diversification plan as part of its vision importantly saudi officials want higher prices ahead of the ipo of saudi aramco tentatively scheduled for
exiting the opec cuts would pose a serious risk to oil prices even if inventories are indeed back at average such it is very useful for saudi arabia to pivot to oil industry investment levels as a justification for keeping the production cuts in place
oil prices will drift higher as inventories dip below average levels and the market grows tighter
for other opec members higher oil prices also shower them with more cash so no harm in going along
keeping barrels offline does require a sacrifice but prices have shot up over the past year more than offsetting the pain of restricting supply
there is a risk sparking too much rival supply
but for now opec is playing for the talking about the need for more investment is a way of saying hey world we re opec and we want higher prices but we re actually doing you a favor mike wittner head of oil market research at societe generale sa told bloomberg
