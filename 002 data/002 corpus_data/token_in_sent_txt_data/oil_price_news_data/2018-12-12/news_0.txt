why the opec+ deal won’t cut it
now nearly a week removed from the agreement confidence in the efficacy of the deal is becoming after announced cuts of million barrels per day a flurry of reports from oil analysts and investment banks congratulated the group on a job well done
after all the figure was larger than the market had reality is beginning to set in
first the cuts might not be realized in january despite the promise
russia indicated that it was going to slow walk the cuts phasing in an initial to bpd in reductions in january
this is significant because russia is the main actor in the cohort
the group is expected to slash output by bpd but if russia is only going to do its part gradually over the next few months the cuts might not reach the promised levels anytime soon
moreover because there are no allotments it will be hard to hold any producer undermines confidence in the deal
compared to early last week the outcome was rather disappointing the whole process wasn t convincing and it s still uncertain whether they will actually cut abn amro senior energy economist hans van cleef told oil traders are suddenly doubting the integrity of the deal even if were to adhere to its promised cuts it still might not be enough

the agreed production cuts will not be enough to ensure sustained and immediate recovery in oil prices
the muted market reaction seen thus far comes as no surprise to rystad says that the cuts agreed to in vienna provide a soft floor beneath oil prices for now and the group can still succeed if it extends the cuts through the end of
the coalition is set to evaluate the progress of the cuts in april and might decide to extend the cuts in june if they feel the market needs more time
most likely opec will be forced to conduct production management sporadically over the next few years unless us shale supply grows even faster than we currently expect
opec members have their work cut out for them in the years to come rystad s tonhaugen said
