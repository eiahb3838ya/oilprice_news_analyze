why oil markets canâ€™t escape opec, russian influence
opec members and their allies have yet to decide how to share the million bpd production boost they pledged in june
when they saw the market started to tighten too quickly which pushed oil prices to a ringing in the beginning of demand a meeting this weekend in algiers opec and allies are expected to tackle the issue with the distribution of that million bpd production boost but the cartel and its key partner russia are looking years beyond the production want control over the oil market and oil prices although their preferred wording is market stability and balance global oil demand is beginning to face some headwinds as a result of factors that we have little or no control over opec secretary general mohammad barkindo told bloomberg in a recent interview in is looking forward to continuing to work together with its partners not only to strive to keep the balance but also to ensure that this equation remains favorable not only for producers but also for consumers opec s chief our ultimate objective as a producer group is to see that despite the urge for diversification of the sources of energy of which our member countries also play a role we would like to see oil continue to be the energy source of choice for the foreseeable future he about the future of the production cut deal that has been in place since january barkindo told bloomberg there is no viable alternative on the table other than to institutionalize and make this cooperation between ourselves and our good partners from in a permanent related norway s offshore oil boom is back onthe oil industry needs it and we are beginning to see the stability returning the opec chief arabia s khalid and russia s alexander energy ministers of the respective leaders of the opec and group of producers that are part of the deal met this weekend in moscow to discuss the state of the oil market affirmed their readiness to react to changes in the oil market and reiterated their plans to make the cooperation the russian energy ministry both and novak reiterated their joint commitment to ensuring the adequacy of oil supplies particularly in light of the uncertainties in the markets the saudi press agency said about the the two ministers reiterated their determination to continue working towards establishing a cooperation framework between opec and producer countries to serve as a basis for proactively promoting market stability while serving the interests of producers consumers and the global economy the saudi statement this month opec s barkindo said that the world would hit the million bpd level of consumption in the fourth quarter of much sooner than a week later opec revised down its global oil demand growth estimate for this year and next for a second consecutive month pointing at a combination of factors that could slow down global economic tightening from central banks weakening finances in some emerging and developing economies rising trade tensions and ongoing geopolitical concerns
related oil companies slash debt to levelsvery strong demand over the past year and a opec and friends a lot in their mission to bring the oil market back to balance
but now the headwinds for the global economy and oil demand have opec worried that a slackening demand could depress oil prices hurt opec member oil incomes and economies again and ruin the market too much tailwind for oil prices due to reduced supply expected from venezuela s plunging production and returning sanctions on iran is not opec s preferred solution either
higher prices support rival oil production most notably in the united states and could hurt the emerging economies oil demand due to the combination of high oil prices and weakening emerging market and allies response to these conflicting market forces is stability supply to keep oil prices high enough for oil producing nations revenues but not too high to let demand be destroyed or rival supply to rise too much
opec and friends are now aiming at institutionalizing the market stability efforts to continue to influence the oil market and prices for years to tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
