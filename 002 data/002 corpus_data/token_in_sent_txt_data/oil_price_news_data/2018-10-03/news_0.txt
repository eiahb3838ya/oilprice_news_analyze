saudi arabia and russia make secret oil deal
are saudi arabia and russia helping trump out by agreeing to increase oil production a new report from reuters says that russia and saudi arabia struck a private deal in september to increase production in order to suppress oil prices
intriguingly the pair apparently phoned the before the algiers meeting in late september to relay the details of their report is an indication that saudi arabia was trying to respond to pressure from president trump to lower oil prices
if the white house was informed about the secret private deal it didn t seem to resolve trump s a few days after the algiers meeting trump blamed opec for high oil prices at the un general assembly in new the secrecy behind the private deal is interesting
it demonstrates that the saudis do not want to be perceived as doing trump s bidding
the russians and the saudis agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on trump s order to pump more one source told the downside of keeping the strategy secret is that if the oil market doesn t know about it or the fact that saudi arabia and russia decided to ramp up production then the effect on prices is muted
after all brent surged to per barrel in recent days evidence that oil traders are not convinced about opec s may not be surprising then that the reuters report came out when it did
was that a deliberate strategy by the saudis to leak the details to the press in order to inform the market
who knows but it came shortly after brent rose its highest level in four years which seems unlikely to be a coincidence

that is up sharply from the it produced in august and the increase offers some evidence to back up the story that saudi arabia and russia agreed to boost output weeks ago and may have told american officials about it
also said that production would be slightly higher in november compared to october added bpd in september pushing output up to a new record high at about
i would expect russia s oil production will hover at around to million bpd until the end of and may increase further to million bpd later on in a source at a major russian oil company told reuters
those are serious numbers and should be taken with a grain of salt but they offer a window into the thinking in the white house still does not appear to be completely mollified
at the end of september trump reportedly called the saudi king and although the nature of that conversation was not disclosed most oil watchers believed that the call was an attempt to pressure the saudis into increasing oil supply

how about our military deals where we protect rich nations that we don t get reimbursed trump said
i love the king king salman but i said king we re protecting you
you might not be there for two weeks without us
you have to pay for your military you have to whether or not he actually said this to the king is questionable but the fact that he appears to be insulting the saudi monarchy in public offers more evidence that he wants them to lower oil prices from today s remains to be seen if trump can convince the saudis to take a more aggressive line although it should be noted that saudi arabia s decision to increase production by bpd from august levels is not trivial
