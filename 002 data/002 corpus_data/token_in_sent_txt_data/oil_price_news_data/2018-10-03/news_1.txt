venezuela’s oil exports are falling even faster than expected
a delay in port repairs following a tanker collision is putting additional pressure on already pressured venezuelan crude oil exports reuters quoted anonymous sources close to pdvsa as saying this week
it seems that venezuela s woes are only multiplying as time goes by although news from official caracas sources seems more upbeat
oil however appears at the forefront of venezuela s dock at venezuela s biggest oil port jose was closed in late august after a tanker collided with it
at the time reuters reported that the repairs would delay the delivery of million barrels of crude destined for rosneft which according to the news outlet could put a strain on relations between the russian company and pdvsa which have a agreement
this is only the latest in pdvsa s troubles with its oil a steady decline in production venezuela s oil company earlier this year ran into problems with its storage capacity and export terminals in the caribbean as conocophillips took an aggressive approach to enforcing a court ruling that awarded it us billion in compensation for the forced nationalization of two projects in venezuela
the company this summer seized several of pdvsa s assets on caribbean islands which made it difficult for the venezuelan state company to meet its export obligations
having few options pdvsa eventually caved settling with repairs are further complicating matters
pdvsa is supposed to deliver to rosneft some million bpd of crude under the latest bilateral agreement signed this april
on top of that it normally exports crude for valero energy and chevron from the same dock the south dock of the jose port which is responsible for processing processes as much as percent of the country s crude oil to anyone s surprise the delay in resuming shipments is largely a result of insufficient funds partially thanks to sanctions which have essentially closed nearly completely the door to foreign funding
china not bound by these restrictions recently agreed to a us lifeline for the venezuelan government and its oil industry but these billions will take time to become available
given the multitude of problems that pdvsa is having it would be a tough job to allocate these funds so that there is enough for everything
related the billion deal that could revive the aramco ipocaracas is still not giving up
just this week the government announced the official launch of the petro on international markets in hopes of offsetting the effects of sanctions by using this cryptocurrency
president nicolas maduro said at the launch that the petro would be legal tender for everything in venezuela including as a substitute for the dollar
all venezuelans will have access to the petro and through it to make international purchases maduro also plans to boost its oil exports to china as part of plans to transform its economy and get back on its feet
to this end it will work with chinese oil companies to improve production
maduro said in july that pdvsa would boost oil production by million bpd from june levels by the end of the year although he admitted that this goal would be difficult to achieve
venezuela pumped million bpd in august and the average stands at million bpd
this is a far cry from the figure from five years ago when its daily average was million bpd
it s a matter of a short time to see if the petro and chinese money will be enough to reverse the decline in production and irina slav for top reads from
