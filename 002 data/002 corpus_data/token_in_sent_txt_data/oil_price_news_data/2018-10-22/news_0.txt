this alliance could mark a new era for oil
saudi arabia and russia could formalize a strategic partnership that would last indefinitely potentially marking a new era for the oil a interview with tass saudi oil minister khalid said that he hopes to setup an official governing body including a secretariat likely to be based in vienna
the proposal could be finished by date has been a somewhat informal group or at least a provisional one intended to address the supply glut that emerged following the market past june the group all but declared mission accomplished watering down the production targets by agreeing to a vague increase in collective production by million barrels per day
without the urgent need to balance the market the purpose of the agreement following the june meeting already started to become wants to put together an official governing structure that would preside over oil market coordination going forward
w e want to sign a new cooperation agreement that is
that does not expire after or
we will leave it open told tass
he said that the purpose of would not be aimed at a fixed production target but to coordinate production levels as they see of course this has always been the mission of opec
the objective of establishing a permanent body raises the question of what is supposed to happen to opec
suggests that could work closely with it seems confusing since all of the opec members are in while contains a bunch of additional countries
how will these two bodies interact and to what degree will they overlap
that much remains one certainty is that there is somewhat of a changing of the guard with opec giving way to a governing structure dominated by just two countries
saudi arabia seems keen on forgoing the struggle of working with more than a dozen countries to build consensus preferring a of sorts with i think russia will have to take the leadership said when asked about who will be the driving force behind establishing a formalized secretariat
russia is a heavy weight both in terms of production and in terms of political influence
so russia s leadership for is indisputable
that s why i expect russia would play a key related the biggest winners in the mediterranean energy warthe rest of opec or for that matter no longer carries the weight they once did
several opec members suffer from instability and volatile production levels some are presiding over declining output
aside from kuwait and the uae no one else has the ability to add or subtract supply from the market based on strategic or political calculations
just about every other member is trying to produce as much as even alluded to the fact that most of the power to manipulate oil market conditions is concentrated in saudi arabia and russia
he said the new would still nominally adhere to the one country one voice philosophy but he also seemed to suggest that the group s two largest producers would really be in charge
yes we ultimately want everybody to be on board
but my experience is that countries like russia and saudi arabia with bigger scale and bigger impact ultimately carry more weight said
because people know that if we agree to cut five percent as we did our volumes are when we sit around the table our voice carries more he even suggested that formal voting would not really be the focus but convincing other saudi arabia and russia will set the agenda and the rest of will follow their what does have in store for the next few months
in the even as many in the oil market are concerned about supply shortages as iranian production goes offline had his eye on demand risks
he noted that the strong dollar combined with currency weakness in emerging markets could curtail demand
a global economic slowdown more generally could slow consumption
he also was concerned about declines and outages in several opec and countries including venezuela iran mexico libya and nigeria which would require action from saudi arabia
on the other hand the rate of growth from shale is still up in the air
related china s oil addiction is its main weakness as a superpowerwith so many mixed signals the trajectory of the oil market is not clear
so wants to take a approach
in fact an internal opec report suggests the group is worried about a seasonal lull this winter
as refineries enter maintenance periods crude demand could soften which could lead to increases in inventories
the buildup amid the upward trend in us crude oil production could be a bearish factor for oil prices in the coming few weeks the opec report said according to the wall street i f supply is too long we should be able to cut
if supply is short we have to be able to respond
we would like to do it in a coordinated way
we do not want to confuse the market and surprise the market he told question that is concerning the market is the true extent of global spare capacity
said that saudi arabia has of spare capacity assuming current production levels of
saudi arabia has never demonstrated sustained production about so the ability to produce up to is still i can say that we can go up if necessary to mln bpd
this i can assure nick cunningham of top reads from
