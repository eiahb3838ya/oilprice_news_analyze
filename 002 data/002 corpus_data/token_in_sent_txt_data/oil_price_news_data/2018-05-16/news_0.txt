iea: high oil prices “taking a toll” on demand
geopolitics has taken over the oil market driving oil prices up to highs
the inventory surplus has vanished and more outages could push oil prices up even higher
yet there are some signs that demand is starting to take a hit as oil closes in on per the iea s may oil market report the agency said that opec might be needed to step in and fill the supply gap if a significant portion of iran oil goes offline
saudi arabia suggested shortly after the announced its withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal that opec would act to mitigate any supply shortfall should it while geopolitical fears helped push brent up to per barrel in recent days the underlying fundamentals are also mostly s production is plummeting and output is bpd below it agreed upon target as part of the opec deal
conservative estimates suggest that the country could lose several hundred thousand barrels per day over the course of but there are several massive threats to pdvsa s operations that could make that forecast look continues aggressive action to obtain control of pdvsa s assets after an international arbitration court awarded it billion in awards
related the most underappreciated story in the oil marketthere is a great deal of confusion about what conoco s actions mean for venezuela s oil production but the asset seizures could be pivotal
reuters reports that the american oil major is now trying to seize two cargoes of crude and fuel near a terminal in aruba run by citgo a subsidiary of pdvsa
the cargoes are holding barrels of oil and bpd of jet fuel gasoline and top of that venezuela is set to hold a presidential election on may an event that could be met with more painful sanctions
conoco s actions combined with a crackdown by the treasury could send venezuela s oil production deeper into a death big question is if supply will be lost in iran which coupled with the supply losses in venezuela could severely tighten the oil market
the potential double supply shortfall represented by iran and venezuela could present a major challenge for producers to fend off sharp price rises and fill the gap not just in terms of the number of barrels but also in terms of oil quality the iea wrote in its crude inventories fell in march by million barrels putting total stocks at a low and crucially million barrels below the average
that data point is worth emphasizing opec has claimed for more than a year that it was trying to erase the inventory surplus and at least according to iea data that mission has now been the group may not be ready to take their foot off of the accelerator
they meet in a few weeks in vienna to figure out their next steps
but with inventories now back at average levels there is some upward pressure on oil prices particularly with more outages looming in the cure for higher oil prices tends to be higher oil prices
the iea lowered its demand forecast for by bpd not a massive revision but notable because it offers some signs that demand will slow as prices rise
some other reports back up this notion
there are reportedly spot cargoes for oil from west africa russia and kazakhstan that are going unsold forcing steep discounts
while recent data continue to point to very strong demand in and the start of we expect a slowdown in growth in up until now demand growth looked strong but the recent jump in oil prices will take its related rising fuel prices could offset tax cuts click to enlarge on balance the report is tending more to the negative side
demand for oil has been revised downwards for the second half of the year from april pvm oil associates strategist tamas varga told iea noted that the global economy is still doing well and that underlying demand growth remains strong around the that suggests demand won t suddenly fall off of a cliff
still the fact is that crude oil prices have risen by nearly since june the agency cautioned
it would be extraordinary if such a large jump did not affect demand growth especially as subsidies have been reduced or cut in several emerging economies in recent by nick cunningham of top reads from
