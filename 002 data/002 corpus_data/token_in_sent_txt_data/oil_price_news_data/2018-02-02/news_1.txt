how far can venezuelaâ€™s oil production fall
venezuela s oil production continues to plummet and some of the dire production scenarios for the south american nation are no longer looking as remote as they once compliance remained elevated in january halting a slide in oil prices even as new data reveals soaring production growth from shale
opec compliance hit percent in january essentially the same as december
nigeria and saudi arabia actually raised their oil production levels in january from a month earlier
but the reason that opec was able to avoid a slide in its compliance rate is that venezuela continues to see its production base erode at a rapid reasons for the decline are the same as they have been for quite a while an economic crisis that is only worsening no cash for investment or even maintenance a debt crisis sanctions the politicization of pdvsa and a brain drain from the company
unfortunately these factors are not going away which means venezuela s output and political situation will likely remain in a downward spiral during barclays analysts wrote in a research investment bank predicts that venezuela s oil production will average million barrels per day in a shocking decline of roughly bpd from the average
in the second half of output averages just situation is compounded by a spiraling debt crisis
for years venezuela and pdvsa have prioritized meeting bond payments pretty much above all else even a worsening humanitarian crisis playing out in the streets
people go hungry want for basic items and die in hospitals that lack medicine
yet creditors continued to be paid at least up until a few months ago
the fear has been that once pdvsa defaults on major bond payments creditors could go after oil assets around the world that would make the situation much worse for the country
related three factors that could end the oil rallyas such venezuela could try to continue to pay creditors what it can
the problem however is that the government is fighting on too many fronts
because it has no cash to even fund the most basic maintenance at its oil fields and refineries production is now in steep decline
that will make its cash situation even worse with each passing day which in turn will make meeting debt payments more difficult
i f production continues to fall at the recent accelerated pace the government s runway to pay upcoming obligations will be severely shortened barclays analysts only way the situation can be reversed barclays says is a change of government
we believe sustainably growing output would likely require a combination of the following a regime change fx reforms adjustments to fiscal terms changes to pdvsa s equity mandate and higher oil prices barclays wrote
that is a serious set of circumstances that is unlikely to play out anytime soon
so the declines accelerated decline in the fourth quarter suggests that actual could be occurring barclays says but data and intel on what s taking place at the ground level is hard to come by

the bank s headline figure of a loss of bpd from venezuela this year is based on the average not what the country produced at the end of the year around
in other words if venezuela can exit at about or a little below the losses at least in the global context wouldn t be that the other hand barclays noted that there is some downside risk to even this dire forecast
there is a possibility of a sharper decline due to the creditors decision to attach assets accelerated debt payments or a further escalation of political tensions the bank said
in the event of a sudden significant supply disruption we would expect prices to rally percent over the near term though a sustained outage could strengthen prices however any sudden loss of such a great magnitude would likely prompt higher production from opec in order to prevent a painful price matter how you slice it venezuela s oil production is heading south
the uncertainty is around how bad it will nick cunningham of top reads from
