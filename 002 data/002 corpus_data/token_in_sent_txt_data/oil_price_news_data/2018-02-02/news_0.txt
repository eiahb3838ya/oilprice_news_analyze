will rising crude inventories end the rally?
crude oil inventories jumped this past week for the first time in nearly three months rising by million barrels
the inventory increase coming at a time of surging oil production could rattle the oil price rally
however the stock builds were always expected and are typical at this time of jump in inventories put an end to consecutive weeks of inventory drawdowns which have the stock surplus within sight of the average
that could test the oil price rally which has sputtered in the last few weeks with brent at about per barrel and wti in the

and as most major analysts have predicted including the iea eia and opec the stock build was inventory increase came not coincidentally in a week in which refinery inputs dropped significantly falling from million barrels per day for the week ending on january to for the week ending on january averages
as refineries throttle back the pull on crude oil from inventories at least according to the most recent data the trend isn t overwhelmingly bearish
standard chartered noted that the increase in inventories was not even that large on a seasonal basis and it was less than the average although the past five years have included several years of extraordinary stock increases so the average is somewhat misleading
while stocks increased on an absolute basis they didn t really increase against that a bit more comfort to oil bulls was the draw in gasoline and another sharp draw at cushing that took inventories below their range standard chartered wrote in a note
lower refining runs might mean a diminishing effect on crude demand but it also means that refineries won t be stashing so much gasoline into storage
the eia said that gasoline stocks fell in the most recent week by million barrels
related oil markets are at a stalematein other words the stock build is not the bearish news that it might seem particular because it was widely expected to crop up at some point in the first the is only part of the picture
stocks have been declining around the world not least because production outside of north america is flat and in some countries falling by quite a ultimately we think the market is a little bit of a smokescreen actually for the oil industry with ongoing supply issues elsewhere and also the strong demand really tightening up this market and further i suppose reducing that global inventory glut that opec has been targeting for some time daniel hynes of anz told goldman sachs stated that it believes the rebalancing effort is already here
instead of just looking at inventories opec is targeting inventories across the oecd
oil production is surging which will push up inventories for a good part of this year but that isn t the case elsewhere
even that data omits what is going on in the where demand is growing at a much faster sachs says the timespreads in the futures market implies that inventories are currently much lower than many people think
oecd stock data is published with a longer lag time and while it will take time to see a clearer picture the investment bank estimates that the point of rebalancing has arrived
opec will keep the cuts in place and the market will probably tighten well below the average before that is reflected in the data
this is why the bank sees brent going above per barrel in the next six the oil market will have a murky picture for a little while longer
the market is tightening and many expect it to tighten particularly in the second half of this year but the expected increase in crude inventories over the next few weeks and months will muddy the waters
oil traders will see soaring oil production and inventory builds as a sign that the market tightening has slowed
and indeed with the preponderance of speculative positions on the bullish side there is downside last week s inventory increase and the stock builds to come don t necessarily mean that we re in for another protracted nick cunningham of top reads from
