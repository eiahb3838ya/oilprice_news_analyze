libyan oil exports rise amid high opec compliance
back in december we discussed how us oil inventories had been drawn down by a hundred million barrels from their peak last march channeling dr evil from austin recent weeks we have been on tour presenting our proprietary outlook and have been highlighting the case of another million barrels this time via the cumulative drop in saudi crude exports over the last chart below shows the cumulative drop in opec exports in versus the october reference level
it highlights that opec on the aggregate reduced imports by a total of million barrels meeelion barrels last down that drop saudi arabia accounted for about million barrels the driving force behind the rebalancing others also showed compliance with the opec production cut deal by cutting exports such as kuwait and angola these efforts were offset by rising exports elsewhere from the likes of libya and nigeria
on the aggregate opec members minus saudi accounted for just under half the drop in exports last year click to enlarge libya who was part of the opec production cut deal increased crude exports last year by an average of nearly bpd versus october reference level
this essentially canceled out the export cut by saudi arabia albeit a swap of heavier crude for lighter barrels a key theme in the global crude market crude exports peaked in october before geopolitical tension in the region scuppered production once more
production at oil fields in the jikharra area which flows to the ports of zueitina and ras lanuf were impacted in early november due to protests
exports out of ras lanuf accordingly dropped to a low in november and to a low out of zueitina in this there have been an increasing number of incidents ratcheting up tension in the region from worker abductions to fuel shortages to heavy of the biggest influences on crude flows however came from an attack on the waha pipeline in late december which caused a production loss estimated at bpd
the pipeline was repaired in early january and flows have rebounded again

the product is called alerts and can be explained via the chart below
related have oil prices hit a ceiling the recent events in libya described above as well as others which have disrupted crude flows and caused prices to rally have been sent to clients as alerts
as disruptive influences have risen in libya the frequency of our high impact alerts have increased along with the price of oil hark below the oil market much more precariously balanced than it was just six months ago geopolitical events and supply outages are having a much more profound impact on the oil market
that is why we have launched this service to instantly quantify these disruptive events and speed up
and the bonus for us is that we are increasingly better informed always a good thing
