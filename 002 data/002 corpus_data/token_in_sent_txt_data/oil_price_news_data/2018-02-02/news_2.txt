the u.s. oil boom is attracting canadian drillers
canadian oil and gas drillers are moving their rigs to the united states in response to greater demand for their service there and an investment climate at home that is according to industry insiders only making their lives a recent story for the globe and mail dan healing quotes a few executives from drilling companies who say they re taking rigs to the permian in texas and the exodus will likely intensify even if not all drillers are too comfortable with the move so far to the of these executives trinidad drilling s ceo brent conway put it in simple terms we raised taxes we increasing costs because of labour laws that are changing we are building pipelines and we ca get federal or provincial governments to do anything to help us
meanwhile in the lower drillers are getting closer to the mark by the day despite warnings that they might drill themselves into the ground if they don t rein in production growth
these words spoken last year by continental resources harold hamm rang out across the industry when benchmarks were just beginning to recover
but now with brent still very close to a barrel and wti enjoying a lift to it s easy to forget them so shale boomers are drilling and hedging their future production at the higher prices
for them life seems to be canadian drillers not so much
a lack of pipeline capacity seems to be the most pressing problem
it is not a new problem
it has been around for years and even in canadian media reported warnings that the discount at which canadian crude trades to west texas intermediate will only widen if no new pipelines are built and this will hurt the performance of the local oil industry

keystone xl has not yet received a final investment decision as doubts persist about it being economical and environmental opposition remains strong
trans mountain s expansion a project that the federal government of justin trudeau approved last year is also far from certain as the government of british columbia has put its foot down vowing to do whatever it takes to shelve the project canadian select wcs is currently trailing wti prices by a discount of more than a barrel
that s a very wide gap and even pm trudeau seems to be aware of it because at a recent town hall meeting in edmonton he said that canadian crude needs new markets and therefore needs the trans mountain expansion to reach the coast of british columbia
yet there was no cheer at the meeting
opposition to the project to all pipeline projects in canada is riding the high wave of saving the planet oblivious to questions like where the more than people now working in oil and gas in alberta alone are going to go and what is going to replace the industry s contribution to the provincial and federal contribution may not be percent as it is in much more economies but it is there
until the pipeline problem is solved more drillers will leave for the permian and the rigs according to the industry executives that spoke to the globe and mail may never come irina slav for top reads from
