don't underestimate the trade war impact on oil demand
a squeeze on oil demand is looming as a result of the trade war a senior bp executive told reuters
acknowledging the bullish effect of sanctions on iran in the short term janet kong bp s chief executive of oil trading operations in asia said this effect will be as the market absorbs the shock and moves on to other going into i worry about the impact of the trade war manifesting itself slowly the executive said
the trade war impact has not really shown up in the data anywhere but it will show up gradually over time
so the supply shock is very sharp and prompt while the impact from trade war is boiling over there have been voices warning that the trade war will affect oil demand as it affects economic growth in china but official oil demand forecasts have yet to factor it in it seems
opec s latest monthly oil market report however did revise the cartel s forecasts for oil demand in down by bpd to million bpd warning that global economic growth may international energy agency on the other hand has kept its demand forecast unchanged in the latest fundamentals update at million bpd up from this year s projected million bpd
yet the agency noted that demand could be stronger were it not for the trade war and signs of stalling economic growth in emerging economies
related oil is a distinct possibilitywhile general economic growth patterns are dependent on a host of different factors the trade war is outside the normal course of events and according to kong likely to drag on for quite a while which would extend the duration of its negative effect on oil the trump administration wants intellectual property protection kong said
reducing subsidies to chinese soes enterprises and open market access by all businesses which are difficult in my view for the chinese government to agree to
so it s very likely this war will drag on for a long by irina slav for top reads from
