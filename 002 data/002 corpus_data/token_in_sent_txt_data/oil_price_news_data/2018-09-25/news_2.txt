schlumberger to buy russia's leading drilling company
the past four years have been a century low point for western foreign investment in russia with sanctions unlawful trade practices and ceaseless wars in the greater middle east antagonizing the sides even further
against such a difficult background when virtually no western major brave enough to enter the russian market and most american firms rolling back projects it is doubly notable what schlumberger is doing
in fact schlumberger seems to be one might say finally on the brink of concluding a milestone russia deal which would greatly fortify its standing as the world s leading oil services company
by buying into russia s largest onshore drilling firm eurasia drilling company edc it could secure access to a massive market irrespective of political tensions
well almost news that schlumberger is allegedly keen on acquiring edc first emerged in early
even then several months after the introduction of a ban on any western participation in arctic or shale projects it raised eyebrows as an excessively ambitious undertaking
schlumberger initially wanted to gain immediate and full control over edc s equity then agreed to a of and in the end somewhat grudgingly acquiesced to offer billion for because russian authorities were concerned about the potential loss of an influential element of the nation s oil sector to be followed by a acquisition three years later of the remaining
confronted with massive bureaucratic pushback schlumberger renounced on the idea pledging to look for m a possibilities only to come around with a new offer two years fact that it is schlumberger not some other service major that is buying russia s leading oil services company is by no means accidental
the of edc alexander dzhaparidze neither he nor the other owner alexandr putilov are under sanctions has sold his first oil company the petroalliance to schlumberger in
partially on the money generated by the sale dzhaparidze bought drilling assets by the private major lukoil thus the development of edc
since then edc and schlumberger have forged a sort of a strategic alliance in with several of each other s russian assets in the years leading up to the acquisition negotiations
related here s what s next for russian lngsince however a whole slew of things has changed
the united states have levied their umpteenth round of sanctions against russia and very few are those who still believe that bilateral relations can be mended anytime soon
illustrating the depth of the schism the russian government is openly saying that the populace should brace itself for years if not decades of sanctions
eurasia drilling has changed too following the failure of the first schlumberger bid in late the top management effectuated a deal and shortly after going private edc has delisted its shares from the london stock exchange
against the background of rising oil prices a genuine feeling of cautious optimism in the global markets and even russia s gdp bouncing back into growth in schlumberger launched another bid in july the oil market managed to test the bottom and rebound back into almost universally palatable levels within less than three years there has been little change in the stance of russia s federal antimonopoly office fas it is comfortable with schlumberger taking anything within the share interval
fas authorities even recommended schlumberger to launch a joint bid with russia s direct investment fund or a uae fund
this is a highly unlikely scenario as letting in the russian government would definitely not serve edc s aim to derisk its activities
especially so as a powerful company the oil giant rosneft seemed very eager to immerse edc in the past
despite rosneft s statements to the contrary there is no guarantee that it will not give it another go once its debt burden eases
related why peak oil demand doesn t matterall in all edc is interested in schlumberger as a buyer schlumberger is interested in edc to provide a big boost to its russia presence statistics differ on edc s market share however generally it is located within the interval
against such a constellation a deal of some sorts ought to emerge at one point and despite sporadic antics from russian authorities there have been encouraging signs in the past few weeks pointing towards such a mutually acceptable solution
odd as it may seem the latest presumed deal setup reflects the geopolitical conditions between russia and the united states
as it stands the russian government is conditioning the deal with schlumberger on the us firm granting its rights on a part of its technologies to a russian entity in case it decides to leave the country spurred by further us should be noted that the list of specific technologies to be retained is still a matter of negotiations so there is still work to be done on the edc saga
schlumberger also agreed to relocate edc which is currently a cayman company to russia also preliminarily agreeing to the state s local content requirements with regard to edc s equipment and component procurement
schlumberger s readiness to accept the sanctions clause might be the missing piece to the puzzle
if the deal goes forward for once a separate us treasury approval is also required it will be the biggest russian oil investment in the sanctions era a timely and poignant reminder that sometimes the oil community is better off without viktor katona for top reads from
