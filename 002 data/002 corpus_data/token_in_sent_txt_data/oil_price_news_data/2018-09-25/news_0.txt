how the eu is helping iran skirt sanctions
at the un general assembly on tuesday president donald trump was laughed at by global leaders when he boasted about his accomplishments
he may feel insulted by the reception he got in new york but a day earlier his administration saw a more tangible display of how much the international community opposes some of his monday the european union announced a decision to launch a special purpose vehicle with the mission of helping iran blunt the impact of sanctions
iran is still in compliance with its obligations under the nuclear deal according to the international atomic energy agency and the signatories aside from the remain firmly in the deal
we are not backing down on the iran nuclear agreement said a european diplomat according to the wall street is nearly friendless in its quest to tear up the iran nuclear deal save for saudi arabia and israel and the eu s initiative is intended to keep the accord alive
china and russia offered their support for the new financing despite their support iran has been hit hard by sanctions as the world dials back on its purchases from iran
the iranian rial has plunged in value this year and oil exports are expected to continue to decline
without the benefits of the nuclear deal iran has little incentive to remain in the accord and may eventually bow mindful of the urgency and the need for tangible results the participants welcomed practical proposals to maintain and develop payment channels notably the initiative to establish a special purpose vehicle spv to facilitate payments related to iran exports including oil britain china france germany russia and the eu announced in a joint statement
the goal is to protect the freedom of their economic operators to pursue legitimate business with the eu s plan consists of an entity setup for the sole purpose of processing payments for companies doing business with iran
this would allow european companies to buy oil from iran without fear of getting hit by sanctions
the trade would presumably take place in a currency other than the greenback because of sanctions on dollar transactions

estimates from earlier this year pegged iran s losses at around bpd but more recent estimates put the losses at million barrels per day or perhaps even more by the end of the year
iran s oil exports fell to in august down bpd from a month ability of the to demand compliance from so many countries is a testament to the power of the international financial system and the strength of the dollar as the world s reserve currency
still there are those that believe the aggressive use of sanctions will backfire on the dollar in the long run
in the future the effort by the nations to setup an alternative payments system may be viewed as a turning point a small but highly symbolic attempt at undermining dollar the short run it is unclear if the effort will have an impact
the question is whether this will work because of course the us will continue to exert colossal pressure on the european union and with a strong desire can easily trample down any mechanism vladimir yermakov director of the department for and arms control at the russian foreign ministry told reporters according to the everything depends on how far the americans want to go and how far our european colleagues will allow them to related jp morgan expect brent oil to reach on iran sanctionsit is not clear that european companies will be convinced to trust the special purpose vehicle setup by the eu or that buying iranian oil will go unpunished by washington
already total sa has withdrawn from a major natural gas project in iran and other major european companies such as peugeot renault and siemens have also suspended their iranian operations
there is little prospect of their in europe have dramatically cut their imports of iranian oil which has been an important factor in the decline of iran s oil exports
that also seems unlikely to the decisions by individual private companies to continue to do business with iran the eu initiative could be rendered symbolic
