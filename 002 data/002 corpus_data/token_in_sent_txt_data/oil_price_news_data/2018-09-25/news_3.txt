has iran started to switch off oil tanker tracking systems?
with sanctions on iran s oil exports just six weeks away at least ten iranian oil supertankers have gone dark not having broadcast any signal for at least a week tanker tracking data compiled by bloomberg shows suggesting that tehran may have resurrected the old unconventional tactic to conceal its crude oil shipments by switching off transponders on iran is deploying this tactic tanker tracking data of iranian oil exports may become less and less reliable as the starting date for the sanctions on tehran s oil approaches
satellites and shore stations haven t received any signals from the ten very large crude carriers vlcc each capable of transporting up to million barrels of oil for at least seven days according to bloomberg data
according to the data seven of those vessels when last seen were carrying a total of million barrels of crude oil and condensate the oil that iran pumps from its natural gas fields
the last known location of most of the tankers is in the persian to bloomberg while the loss of signals from tankers can be attributed to seasonal weather conditions disruptions from atmospheric conditions are typically much shorter
once the tankers leave the persian gulf they should have shown on satellite tracking systems if they have their tracking systems switched on

one is how much of iran s oil china india and europe will buy in october and then in november when the sanctions kick in
the other is the concern that tanker tracking data may become increasingly unreliable as iran could use unconventional methods of keeping its oil sales on track like switching off tracking devices on method that tehran is said to have used in the previous round of sanctions in have started to assume that the sanctions on iran s oil may remove more than million bpd from the oil market
earlier estimates were of around bpd loss from iran but this was before the started to signal that waivers would be given sparingly if at all and that washington expects all nations to cut off oil trade with iran or risk secondary tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
