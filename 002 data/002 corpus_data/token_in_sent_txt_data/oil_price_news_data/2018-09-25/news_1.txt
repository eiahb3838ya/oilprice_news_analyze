opec's no.4 vows to boost spare oil capacity
opec and allies snubbed calls from president donald trump to lower oil prices saying on sunday that they are satisfied with the overall healthy balance between supply and the key ministers of the deal participants however assured reporters and the market that their respective countries have spare oil production capacity to meet demand by customers if need key message from the energy ministers of saudi arabia russia and the united arab emirates uae was that if demand calls for higher production they would be ready to respond
but right now the oil market is fairly balanced and opec and friends won t rush to supply more oil than its customers want and need as they are careful not to tip the market into oversupply that would chip away at their oil revenues once didn t decide to immediately boost oil production in this balanced market as they view it questions remain as to how much spare capacity that saudi arabia the uae and russia can bring online in case the market significantly tightens in november when sanctions on iran snap back and venezuela s production drops to new uae is planning to boost its total oil production capacity to million bpd by the end of this year the emirates energy minister suhail told s p global platts in an interview after the panel met on sunday to discuss the state of the s producer after saudi arabia iraq and produces just below million bpd
at million bpd in august its oil production increased by bpd from july according to opec s secondary uae is also investing in additional crude oil storage told platts but noted that the country would not overproduce
instead it would lift its production only if there is demand for such uae and other countries are not worried about market instability if they have spare capacity the minister said adding that his country would invest some us billion in upstream projects over the next four to five the spare capacity of some opec members we are not going to come back and significantly oversupply the market and create that imbalance again told cnbc on the sidelines of the panel meeting on sunday
according to the plans by the end of the year the uae will have a spare production capacity of bpd which estimates by platts show would be the after that of saudi arabia

the problem with this estimate is that it has never been arabia s high oil production is million bpd achieved in november just before the deal entered into force
in august the saudis pumped million bpd as per opec secondary sources eia defines spare capacity as the volume of oil production that can be brought online within days and sustained for at least days
related what will trigger the next oil price crash according to the international energy agency iea estimates opec countries have a combined million bpd of spare production capacity of which percent is in saudi but the point about spare capacity is that having been idle it is not clear exactly how much beyond what is widely thought to be easy to bring online will be available to coincide with further falls in venezuelan exports and a maximisation of iranian sanctions the iea said in its latest monthly oil market market is tightening and it s expected to further tighten by the end of the year thanks to iran and venezuela but opec and russia are not rushing to tap into spare capacity because leaving it tight could raise the risk of a spike in oil prices in case of another outage tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
