the u.s. oil production “mirage”
some of the surge in oil production this past spring might have been a on july the eia released monthly data on oil production which revealed a decline in output of bpd in may compared to a month earlier
the dip is a surprise given the widespread assumption that shale production was continuing to grow at a blistering be sure a big reason for the decline in overall output was the decline in production from offshore gulf of mexico
but texas production only rose by bpd a disappointing figure that likely came in far below what most analysts had the monthly total of million barrels per day for may is sharply lower than what eia itself thought at the time
here are the weekly estimates for oil production that the eia put out back then april the weekly estimates tend to be less accurate than the retrospective monthly numbers
that is not a new dynamic and estimating on a weekly basis inherently involves a lot of guesswork so this is not a knock on the the discrepancy is rather striking
not only did the eia estimate that production in april and may was much higher than it actually was but the agency also thought production was rising the weekly estimates were to be believed at the time production would have climbed from in early april to by the end of may an increase of bpd over a roughly only was production lower than that but it didn t actually increase at all
the eia s more accurate monthly figures show a slight decline in output falling from in april to just in weekly data had shown a strong output rise from march to may
the revised data shows that this rise was a mirage output actually fell over the period paul horsnell head of commodities research at standard chartered wrote in a note
related oil production isn t growing as fast as expectedthis is a rather significant development and it has implications for more recent data releases
it is time to deal with the statistical gorilla on the oil trading floor horsnell of standard chartered wrote along with analyst emily ashford
we think us crude oil production has not reached the million barrels per day shown in recent weeks in the energy information administration eia weekly data and that it is significantly below with growth that is a reasonable conclusion given the roughly difference between the two surveys for may
the eia has since switched its reporting for the weekly surveys by rounding off to the nearest bpd but data points from the last few weeks look like this july related exxon s shocking supply and demand predictionsit s a little tricky trying to discern patterns from that data given the rounding off but a few things jump out
first production dipped at the end of july a rather surprising move
output from alaska fell bpd over the last two weeks which likely explains much of the move
however production from the lower has only increased bpd since the week of june which suggests that the permian basin is starting to run into production constraints because of pipeline is a little early to really get a sense of how much the permian is slowing down
most analysts have been assuming an overall slowdown over the next months because of pipeline constraints
however the eia figures might suggest that the problem has already started to bite
in april the eia predicted in its drilling productivity report that permian production would jump by bpd in may
but the monthly data just released finds only modest gains in texas bpd and new mexico bpd the eia thinks output broke in july an high
but judging by the monthly data from april and may perhaps the agency is also overstating july figures which raises the possibility that production is not nearly as high as we currently the coming months if monthly production figures continue to show output undershooting expectations that would have global ramifications
most analysts still are baking in strong shale growth figures into their forecasts
if that additional output fails to materialize the oil market could end up being a lot tighter than we all expected it to nick cunningham of top reads from
