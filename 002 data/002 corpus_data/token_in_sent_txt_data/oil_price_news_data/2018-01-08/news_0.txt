is this lithium battery breakthrough too good to be true?
it would be a dull month if a new rechargeable battery project didn t make headlines amid all the excitement surrounding electric cars
this month s indisputable winner is the battery that replaces cobalt with iron at least according to the people who came up with the potential implications of this invention are huge cobalt is enjoying a very strong rally as demand is estimated to skyrocket with the influx of electric cars in the world s biggest markets notably china and the united states
so is lithium but the iron battery is unlikely to have an impact on lithium demand
also theoretically the iron battery could put some battery makers out of idea of using iron in batteries isn t new but so far attempts to substitute the cheap metal for costlier cobalt and other metals have ended in disaster
christopher wolverton professor of materials science and engineering at northwestern university had two problems to solve to make his battery work
first replace cobalt with iron
second trick oxygen into taking part in the reaction that moves the lithium ions from the anode to the cathode and back again as the battery is charged and second challenge was the bigger one
the widespread opinion in science circles is that using oxygen in the reaction taking place in a rechargeable battery makes the concoction inside unstable and oxygen escapes making the reaction irreversible and the battery
that s why wolverton and his team first made the battery on a computer to see if it would work
surprisingly for all it better than the most popular iron battery uses four lithium ions instead of just one like current batteries do
for now it can only utilize one of these but there s potential for making use of all four considerably increasing the battery s efficiency
related is an oil price correction overdue that s really exciting but the official news release is shy on the experimental aspect of the team s work
there s mention that there was an author in charge of the experimental work but all the details about the composition of the battery and the reaction are about the computations the team made
these computations were used to make the physical battery but the experimental stage of the project is likely at an early further experiments confirm the initial results this battery has the potential to transform many that deal in rechargeable cars to smartphones and wearables
iron is among the cheapest metals in the world with a metric ton currently trading for less than
to compare the futures on cobalt on the london metal exchange is per metric ton
even that would be enough to make the new battery a hit if its viability is confirmed
the greater durability would also be a welcome a battery like that the ev revolution could truly take irina slav for top reads from
