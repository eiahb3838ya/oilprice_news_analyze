what happens next to china’s crude imports?
our friends over at ursa published a blog post yesterday discussing crude inventories at kyaukphyu in myanmar highlighting the seeming political nature of recent crude flows to the storage hub
crude is delivered to cnpc kabala terminal in myanmar and is stored at kyaukphyu before being transported by pipeline to the yunnan refinery in china
since the terminal started up in april we can see from our clipperdata that there has been nearly million barrels discharged there
saudi arabia is a steady supplier accounting for about a half of all crude deliveries and mostly arab medium with volumes averaging about a vlcc a month about million barrels

as the chart above illustrates a couple of iranian cargoes have been delivered in the last few months including bbls of light sweet south pars condensate in june
although we are seeing a dip this month in total iranian barrels into china it is expected that iran will increasingly try to muscle its way in as it is muscled out of elsewhere
chinese imports of iranian barrels are at bpd through the first seven months of the year after running closer to bpd in recent years
central china typically receives the most but flows have dropped considerably to the region this year instead heading to southern and northern destinations
as our clipperdata illustrate below iranian grades into northern chinese ports and mostly qingdao rizhao tianjin caofeidian and dalian have been on the rise in recent years averaging over bpd so far this year

that said imports have dropped off considerably since may after the government changed the tax structure for independent refiners
nonetheless iranian imports into the region are holding up for of crude into northern china on the other hand look set for a bout of weakness
nearly a half of crude imports to china make their way to the independent refiners in the north
amid the threat of tariffs and trade wars flows of mostly light sweet crude wti midland wti dsw and bakken have already slowed from the highs of
while this lower trend should persist amid tighter price spreads iranian crude flows should continue apace
