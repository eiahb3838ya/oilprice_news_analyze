forget oil price forecasts, it’s just another cycle
profit season in the oil industry is in full swing and the mood is upbeat strict financial discipline is paying off cash flows are improving or emerging after a long absence and the industry is growing again
and there are those who claim that we have seen the last big oil price beg to differ however
a notable voice among the skeptics is reuters market analyst john kemp
in a recent column kemp lays out in detail the reasons why the it will never happen again refrain is wishful thinking at best and delusion at worst
the oil industry he says has a cyclical nature
learning from past mistakes while a good thing generally can not help avoid the next bust because boom and bust is the very nature of the scars from the last bust still fresh the oil industry is being cautious with new investments just as it has been after every single bust since the dawn of oil kemp notes
oil companies are suspicious of the price rise uncertain it will last
and they are quite right to be suspicious because no boom ever lasts as history has proven time and again
the problem is that nobody can predict the end of the next cycle and the beginning of a new one hence the if nobody can predict the next price collapse what is the point of having analysts fall over themselves to forecast the unforecastable namely future oil prices
well here s a pertinent quote from john kenneth galbraith economists don t forecast because they know they forecast because they re economic forecasts are notoriously inaccurate and this is particularly and very emphatically true of oil price forecasts
here s another quote from rex tillerson we ve never been good at predicting these price cycles neither when they occur nor their duration
we don t spend a lot of time even that s certainly a smart approach and one that must pay off by saving time effort and money
related are investors turning away from big oil the reasons why predicting the next oil industry cycle is mission impossible come down to the makeup of the oil market and the huge diversity of external factors that have a bearing on prices and therefore on the cycles
the oil market kemp says is actually a collection of numerous submarkets and these are never in balance
when they are in balance it s only for a very short time so the phrase balancing the market is basically the market there are thousands of events that can affect oil prices and there is no way on earth anyone can account for each and every one of these thousands of events ranging from local politics in oil producers and consumers to force majeure events
as bill gilmer director of the institute for regional forecasting at the university of houston puts it the world does not stand still so the chance of any one analyst or big oil ceo getting the price right is pretty much the same as the chance for a tail or a head in a coin what is an industry to do in this environment of chronic uncertainty
ride the cycle kemp says
so producers vow to continue with the strictly disciplined approach to investments
the result will be higher prices stimulating alternative producers a supply build and a subsequent fall in prices
just like every other cycle
the only thing producers could reasonably do whether big oil or opec is plan for the long term and learn to live with the irina slav for top reads from
