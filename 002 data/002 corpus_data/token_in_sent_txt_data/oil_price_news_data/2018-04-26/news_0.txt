u.s. oil exports are only heading higher
oil exports just hit a record high a sign that the shale boom will continue to lead to higher shipments abroad despite some infrastructure week the averaged million barrels per day in crude oil exports the highest average for any week on surge in exports is being driven by several factors
the most obvious is the rapid growth in shale production with shale drillers adding new supply at a blistering rate
record production is leading to record exports

many of the refiners prefer medium and heavier grades
the result is a glut of light sweet oil and exporting those volumes are a logical reason for the upward trend in exports is the renewed price differential between brent and wti
while the oil market is global the two benchmarks reflect some unique geographical circumstances
wti is dragged down by the surging shale supply while brent is seeing tighter conditions in part because of the opec production cuts but also because of strong demand in much of the world
related this discovery is changing solar energy forevera few months ago brent only traded at a premium of per barrel relative to wti
that has widened sharply to more than per barrel in the last week
cheaper crude from the makes it more attractive which leads to higher when including refined petroleum products total petroleum exports hit a record high for the week ending on april eia reported a surprise uptick in crude oil and gasoline inventories in its latest report which weighed on market sentiment
the result was a somewhat mixed bag for oil prices
the builds in crude oil and gasoline inventories are obviously negative but soaring crude oil and gasoline exports cut against those data points john kilduff partner at energy hedge fund again capital llc in new york told long as the spread remains at or per barrel the prospect of higher exports will look there are a few hurdles blocking much higher levels of exports
for one there are bottlenecks in the permian basin that could prevent increased volumes from reaching the gulf coast
the discount for oil in midland is approaching per barrel the highest in years
that is the result of the shrinking availability of space on the region s pipelines
we currently see only of spare capacity available and without additional pipes coming until the second half of we expect basis to remain an issue for the next months said jefferies llc analyst mark a new lithium war is about to beginphillips just announced that it had received enough commitments from oil producers in the permian to move ahead with the construction of its gray oak pipeline which would move oil from the permian to corpus christi
the pipeline would have a capacity of bpd and eventually but it won t come online until the end of the spread widening to over is significant as this spread implies that all the available crude pipeline takeaway was filled at this according to east daley capital analysts and reported on by natural gas reason why exports might eventually cap out is that higher shipments will put pressure on the differential
moving product out of the will drain the surplus connected to the wti benchmark while adding tons of new supply to the atlantic basin will drag down brent
higher oil exports could edge out nigerian supply in the european market for instance
ultimately as more supplies are shipped to europe or elsewhere brent will feel the effects
in short the discount will narrow again closing the window on much higher levels of that doesn t mean that oil exports are set to fall
far from it
we will push into million barrels a day consistently over the summer said rob thummel managing director at tortoise told nick cunningham of top reads from
