u.s. overtakes saudi arabia in recoverable oil reserves
the united states has again outstripped saudi arabia as the holder of the world s biggest recoverable oil resources with current technology largely due to the doubling of fracking operations in the permian according to data by research consultancy rystad added nearly billion barrels in and now has an estimated billion barrels of recoverable oil which are equal to years of production at the current pace of output rystad from the permian where more reserves per well are drilled new areas and formations that have been geologically proved boosted the recoverable oil resources last year according to the energy texas alone now holds more than billion barrels of recoverable oil of which is from shale or other tight formations ie
from wells that require hydraulic fracking to produce commercial quantities of oil said rystad recoverable oil figures include expected production from future discoveries that rystad deems of trillion barrels of yet undiscovered oil globally shale oil makes up close to billion barrels according to rystad energy s database
some percent of these oil resources are in terms of oil that has already been discovered saudi arabia continues to be the undisputed leader holding billion barrels of discovered oil which is billion barrels more than the discovered oil in the united states according to rystad far as commercially proved oil industry s closest definition of oil yet to be concerned the world s total such reserves are billion barrels equal to just years of oil production
opec producers hold around percent of the world s commercially proved reserves
related the unlikely solution to the battery bottleneckaccording to rystad data the new commercially proved reserves added in outpaced last year s production and consumption level globally signaling that there is a sustainable inventory of oil for the short the petroleum resource management system prms from the society of petroleum engineers spe provides a widely accepted scheme for classifying petroleum reserves and resources the term proved reserves is used very differently around the compilations of government reported oil reserves are a mix of apples and oranges and the standards differ largely between oecd and opec countries per magnus nysveen head of analysis at rystad energy tsvetana paraskova for top reads from
