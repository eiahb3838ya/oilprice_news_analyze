the last oil frontier in the gulf of mexico
the gulf of mexico gom has been a tremendous resource that has largely been developed over the last thirty years or so
one by one companies ventured into deep waters using their wits and brawn to bring these deeply buried resources to market
wits and brawn and a lot of money
many companies learned the hard way that deep water was not a fun place to play if your checking account was low
the companies who were adequately capitalized did well rebounding from the initial steepness of the learning curve to add huge reserves and daily production increases to their bottom lines
those of us who drive and use gas to heat our homes can be glad they were successful as now much of the daily offshore production comes from wells drilled in more than a of water
click to enlarge sourceas can be seen from the graphic below the oil industry s advance into deeper waters has been a fairly gradual one
led primarily by the marine engineering developments that occurred as fields farther and farther offshore were explored discoveries made
click to enlarge sourceafter a tremendous initial burst in exploration activity geologists began to run out of prospects and the pace of new discoveries slowed
only the fairly recent ability to see beneath the salt led to the massive peak in e p activity in the early that led to miocene discoveries like thunderhorse mad dog and a number of others
this miracle continued with lower tertiary discoveries like malo jack shenandoah anchor and again a number of others
this period has been referred to as the great unveiling and in the view of some represents a peak potential for the offshore gom deep water is this it for the gom
are we destined to an inevitable decline in production deep water
not all are convinced and that is where the meat of this article really and the norphletshell was the first oil company to really begin to explore and produce deep water resources in the gom
beginning in the early s with the record breaking jacket supported cognac and bullwinkle platforms they took the experience they gained from decades of exploratory work onshore and in waters and began to stretch the universe of what it was possible to do offshore

a lot of lessons were learned along the way
lessons that they can now apply to tackling the production challenges of today where the capital costs associated with reserves development must remain positive in low oil price has been drilling the norphlet for decades onshore in the missississpian and alabaman gulf coast areas
in the late s and early s it extended its familiarity with this reservoir into mobile bay
from five wells drilled in the fairway field offshore alabama shell produced gas in prolific mmscfd for a number of years
these wells were drilled in shallow water to about md and cost upwards of mm to drill and complete at a time when the oil price was about

in the late deepwater was becoming a catch phase in the oil patch

while it s apparent they drilled their share of dry holes the five commercial discoveries listed below are shell and only shell s
other companies just seemed not have the early affinity for picturing this reservoir the way they did
since this was published however nearly four years ago other operators have cashed in on the norphlet most notably chevron at the ballymore prospect and discussed briefly in another article earlier this year
click to enlarge sourceas can be seen in the next graphic shell has feasted off their expertise picturing the norphlet and in sanctioned the appomattox
click to enlarge sourceyou can see above with their latest discovery dover announced on may shell has continued their winning ways in the norphlet
they cut feet of pay here
i expect these wells will be to the appomattox hub through subsea completions

initially only the appomattox and vicksburg fields will be flowed to the hub with the other satellite fields to be produced later
production will consist of oil and of the deepwater norphletaround mm years ago the supercontinent of pangea began to pull apart from emerging tectonic activity
in the case of the gulf of mexico the north american plate separated from the african and south american plates creating a rift basin that developed grabens valleys that filled with volcanic largely windblown eolian sediments
tectonic subduction and crustal stretching over the eons allowed for intrusion of marine waters creating a shallow sea as they did
geologists have named this the louann sea
evaporation and replenishment of this sea over time led to the massive halite deposition now known as the louann by riverine fluvial and eolian clastics particulates this salt layer gradually became buried under sediments that carried the organic material that draws shell interest today

this shows the mountainous source of the sediments

shaved sections of cores are used to analyze the detailed structure of the rock
this sort of analysis has many uses
for the purpose of understanding this article note the blue areas in the slides that provide contrast
this is where the oil and gas are
click to enlarge sourcetwo very encouraging aspects of these plots taken from a boem study done in
first from the upper graph the porosity and permeability are fairly high
porosity is the void space in the rock where hydrocarbons can exist
permeability is a measure of the reservoir s horizontal flow characteristics
second from the lower graph the aeolian net sand or highly porous section of the interval is a large portion of the remains to be seen just how prolific this reservoir will be
first production from appomattox isn t due for another couple of years
will the area in which shell will be driven have sands accumulated under aeolian conditions or fluvial
something that only time and actual drilling will tell and from the plots above will be indicative of the quality of the sands being early indicators look good in the norphlet with permeability exceeding what was thought to be possible in a deeply buried reservoir such the this
shell has made the biggest bet so far on this reservoir based on their years of experience with it
other bets may are high but now we just have to drill david messler for top reads from
