2018-12-18,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices rebounded on Wednesday after falling for the past three sesssions with worries about oversupply and a slowing global economy keeping markets under pressure though sentiment may be shifting as falling equity markets seemed to stabilize. West Texas Intermediate futures (WTI) climbed 4 cents cents, or 0.09 percent, to $46.28 per barrel by 0443 GMT, after plunging 7.3 percent the day before in a session when it touched its lowest since August 2017. Global benchmark Brent crude futures rose 0.4 percent, or 23 cents, at $56.49 per barrel. It dropped 5.6 percent on Tuesday, at one point hitting a 14-month low. WTI prices are holding as ""traders look for some solace in U.S. equity markets as risk sentiment appears to be stabilizing,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA ""But we are far removed from any bullish flip in investor sentiment."" The S&P 500 ended up slightly on Tuesday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.35 percent as both indices ended losing streaks. Further adding to the oversupply concerns, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, while gasoline inventories increased. If the build in crude stockpiles is confirmed by U.S. government data Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. Meanwhile, analysts said that upcoming output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had so far failed to stimulate the market as they were not due to kick in until next month. Output from de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia as well as the United States and Russia - leading producers outside the group - has been at or near record highs. The U.S. government said shale production is expected to climb to over 8 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time by the end of December. Russian oil output is so far this month at a record 11.42 million bpd, an industry source told Reuters. However, there were some factors tightening supply, with Libya's state oil company declaring force majeure at the country's largest oilfield. That came a week after the firm announced a contractual waiver on exports from the field following its seizure by protesters. Elsewhere, a speech marking 40 years of market liberalization by Chinese President Xi Jinping offered no specific support measures for the second-largest economy, disappointing investors who were expecting fiscal policy loosening and a tax cut. China's Shanghai crude futures fell 5.8 percent to trade at 389.4 yuan ($56.53)per barrel on Wednesday, the lowest since their launch in March. Oil market investors were also turning their attention to the outcome of a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve that is due to end on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to raise U.S. interest rates for the fourth time this year though the central bank may temper the outlook for further increases in 2019 due to concerns about the economy.

2018-12-18,"SYDNEY, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Asian share markets played second string to bonds on Wednesday as a spectacular fall in the price of oil spurred speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve might be done with tightening after its policy meeting later in the session. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.4 percent, while Shanghai blue chips were flat. Japan's Nikkei steadied after an early dip and E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added 0.4 percent. Oil had stolen the show as a supply glut saw Brent shed almost 6 percent overnight. U.S. crude was last down another 13 cents at $46.11 a barrel, while Brent recouped just 4 cents to $56.30. Brent's 35 percent plunge since October is sending a disinflationary pulse through the world at a time when trade and economic activity are already cooling. That has only added to pressure on the Fed to abandon its commitment to yet more hikes. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned the central bank not to ""make yet another mistake"", while a Wall Street Journal editorial called for a pause. So far, the futures market is sticking with a two-in-three chance of a rate increase on Wednesday. ""Despite recent market volatility we think that it is still more likely than not that the Fed will raise rates,"" said ANZ senior economist Tom Kenny. ""But we lean slightly toward the Fed removing the reference to the need for 'further gradual increases'."" He also expects the median Fed forecast, or dot plots, to drop to two rate rises for next year, from the three projected back in September. The market is well ahead of that and pricing in less than one rise in 2019. Talk of a dovish turn helped Wall Street steady and the Dow ended Tuesday up 0.35 percent. The S&P 500 edged up 0.01 percent and the Nasdaq 0.45 percent. BOND BONANZA Stocks were left in the dust by bonds as 10-year Treasury yields hit their lowest since August at 2.799 percent , testing a major chart level at 2.80 percent. Yields on two-year U.S. notes touched a three-month trough of 2.629 percent, a massive turnaround from November's 2.977 percent peak. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. Reasons for the rally were easy to find. The latest survey of fund managers globally from BofA Merrill Lynch showed the third biggest decline in inflation expectations on record, while just over half expected the world economy to slow next year. Investors rushed into bonds, with the largest ever one-month rotation into fixed-income assets, while cutting equities. ""Investors are close to extreme bearishness,"" said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. ""All eyes are on the Fed, and a dovish message could equal a bear market bounce."" The steep drop in Treasury yields undermined one of the U.S. dollar's major props and pulled its index back to 96.921 , from a recent top of 97.711. The dollar fell to 112.46 yen, from a 113.70 high last week, while the euro nudged up to $1.1379 from a $1.1266 low. In commodity markets, gold held near its recent five-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher interest rates waned. Spot gold stood at $1,248.85 per ounce.

2018-12-18,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 19 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices rose on Wednesday to claw back part of their more than 5 percent losses from the previous session, with worries about oversupply and a slowing global economy keeping markets under pressure. U.S. crude oil had climbed 37 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $46.24 per barrel by 0122 GMT, after plunging 7.3 percent the day before in a session when it touched its lowest since August last year at $45.79. Global benchmark Brent was up 0.85 percent, or 49 cents, at $56.75 per barrel. It dropped 5.62 percent on Tuesday, at one point marking a 14-month low of $56.16 a barrel. ""The toxic combination of oversupply worries and global growth distress should see oil prices languish into year-end as negative momentum is leading price action,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA.

2018-12-18,"NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled more than 5 percent on Tuesday in heavy trade due to fears of oversupply and deteriorating demand, extending a selloff that has taken major crude benchmarks down more than 30 percent from an October peak. U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent both extended declines in post-settlement trade after trade group The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. inventories unexpectedly climbed in the latest week. U.S. crude oil fell $3.64, or 7.3 percent, to settle at $46.24 a barrel, the weakest since August, 2017. In post-close trade, the contract was down 8 percent to $45.91 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent lost $3.35, or 5.62 percent, to settle at $56.26 a barrel. During the session, Brent hit a 14-month low of $56.16. U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 14 to 441.3 million, API said, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.4 million barrels. If that build is confirmed by U.S. government data Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. More than 900,000 contracts changed hands on Tuesday, far exceeding the 200-day moving average of 591,000 contracts. Investor confidence is deteriorating, with more fund managers expecting global growth to weaken over the next 12 months, the worst outlook in a decade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's December investor survey showed. ""There was a flood of supply-side news yesterday which, in combination with the demand destruction that the stock market slide implied, got us below $50 (a barrel for U.S. crude), and that gave us a strong sell signal,"" said Bob Yawger, director of futures with Mizuho in New York. World stock markets inched higher as investors focused on the next move for the U.S. Federal Reserve, which kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. Equity markets have had steep declines over the last two months, with several stock sectors having reached bear-market territory. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday amid a host of calls to pause its tightening cycle or risk harming the economy. Among the bearish factors, Britain's largest oilfield restarted production, increasing supply, the U.S. government said output from shale would top 8 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and data suggested U.S. crude inventories would rise this week. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million bpd, equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russian oil output hit a record 11.42 million bpd this month, an industry source told Reuters. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected by year-end to surpass 8 million bpd for the first time, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Britain's largest oilfield, Buzzard, restarted after repairs on pipe work, a spokesman for operator Nexen said on Monday. Buzzard produces about 150,000 bpd and is the largest contributor to the Forties pipeline that brings oil to shore from more than 50 fields. Separately, Libya's state oil firm declared force majeure on operations at the country's largest oilfield, El Sharara. The 315,000 bpd field, located in the southern part of the country, was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds.

2018-12-18,"NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Global equity markets dipped on Tuesday as nervous investors awaited indications whether the Federal Reserve will be able to raise interest rates much further amid turbulent markets and a weakening outlook for the global economy. Energy stocks weighed on the U.S. market as oil price declines deepened. Steep drops in equity markets over the last two months have sapped investor confidence, spurring fund managers to predict global growth to weaken over the next 12 months, the worst outlook in a decade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's December investor survey showed.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russian oil output hit a record 11.42 million bpd this month, an industry source told Reuters. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is by the year-end expected to surpass 8 million bpd for the first time, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point for the oil futures contract, rose more than 1 million barrels from Dec. 11 to 14, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. Britain's largest oilfield, Buzzard, restarted after repairs on pipework, a spokesman for operator Nexen said on Monday. Buzzard produces about 150,000 barrels per day and is the largest contributor to the Forties pipeline which brings oil to shore from more than 50 fields. The United States has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil producer, with total crude output climbing to a record 11.7 million bpd.

The latest wave of energy market selling comes amid reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output. Heightened worries of a possible economic slowdown in 2019 have also added downward pressure to the value of a barrel of oil. ""The only way is down,"" Tamas Varga, senior analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note published Tuesday.

2018-12-18,"Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) declared force majeure on operations at its biggest oilfield late Monday night amid a stand-off with armed protesters, expecting a loss of 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the OPEC member. The protest group, known as the Fezzan Rage Movement, shut down the El Sharara oil field in Libya's impoverished southwest earlier this month with the help of security personnel the Petroleum Facilities Guard, a militia known for its clashes with the Islamic State. The movement of tribesmen is demanding better services, health sector support, monetary stimulus for the southern region and better protection from the government, which it claims has marginalized those living in Libya's south. But while oil prices saw a slight rebound of about 2 percent one week ago on news of the shutdown, crude output from the U.S. is so high it's practically drowned out what would otherwise be a notable disruption in the oil market. Brent crude was trading at 58.54 at 2 p.m. London time on Tuesday, down 1.8 percent on the previous day.

However, he noted, ""any further unexpected outages could inject some much needed bullish impetus into the oil complex."" Oil prices have fallen some 30 percent since hitting year-highs in October on concerns of global oversupply and slowing demand growth.

While the crisis does heighten geopolitical risk, said Ehsan Khoman, head of Middle East and North Africa research at MUFG, ""markets remained focused on the more structural concerns that U.S. oil production growth is well north of, and expected to stay, above global demand growth heading into 2019.""

The budget will boost spending even as Saudi Arabia endeavors to close its budget deficit, indicating Riyadh's priority to spur growth in an economy hurt by lower oil prices. State spending will increase by more than 7 percent next year to 1.106 trillion riyals ($295 billion) from 1.030 trillion riyals, in line with a September pre-budget statement, according to the country's finance ministry. Analysts believe the continued cost-of-living allowances, first established in January 2018 and estimated by officials to cost more than $13 billion, are intended to stimulate sluggish growth and shore up support for the royal family and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after a controversy-ridden few months. The royal allowances of 1,000 riyals a month ($266) are paid to civil servants and military personnel, and other allowances will continue for pensioners and those living on social security. Riyadh will also increase student benefits by 10 percent for the next fiscal year, the king announced. The International Monetary Fund previously forecast the country's budget deficit to shrink to less than 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year in the event that the allowances were scrapped.

Further adding to the oversupply concerns, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, while gasoline inventories increased. If the build in crude stockpiles is confirmed by U.S. government data Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks.

2018-12-18,"SYDNEY, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Asian share markets played second string to bonds on Wednesday as a spectacular fall in the price of oil spurred speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve might be done with tightening after its policy meeting later in the session. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.4 percent, while Shanghai blue chips were flat. Japan's Nikkei steadied after an early dip and E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added 0.4 percent. Oil had stolen the show as a supply glut saw Brent shed almost 6 percent overnight. U.S. crude was last down another 13 cents at $46.11 a barrel, while Brent recouped just 4 cents to $56.30. Brent's 35 percent plunge since October is sending a disinflationary pulse through the world at a time when trade and economic activity are already cooling. That has only added to pressure on the Fed to abandon its commitment to yet more hikes. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned the central bank not to ""make yet another mistake"", while a Wall Street Journal editorial called for a pause. So far, the futures market is sticking with a two-in-three chance of a rate increase on Wednesday. ""Despite recent market volatility we think that it is still more likely than not that the Fed will raise rates,"" said ANZ senior economist Tom Kenny. ""But we lean slightly toward the Fed removing the reference to the need for 'further gradual increases'."" He also expects the median Fed forecast, or dot plots, to drop to two rate rises for next year, from the three projected back in September. The market is well ahead of that and pricing in less than one rise in 2019. Talk of a dovish turn helped Wall Street steady and the Dow ended Tuesday up 0.35 percent. The S&P 500 edged up 0.01 percent and the Nasdaq 0.45 percent. BOND BONANZA Stocks were left in the dust by bonds as 10-year Treasury yields hit their lowest since August at 2.799 percent , testing a major chart level at 2.80 percent. Yields on two-year U.S. notes touched a three-month trough of 2.629 percent, a massive turnaround from November's 2.977 percent peak. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. Reasons for the rally were easy to find. The latest survey of fund managers globally from BofA Merrill Lynch showed the third biggest decline in inflation expectations on record, while just over half expected the world economy to slow next year. Investors rushed into bonds, with the largest ever one-month rotation into fixed-income assets, while cutting equities. ""Investors are close to extreme bearishness,"" said Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. ""All eyes are on the Fed, and a dovish message could equal a bear market bounce."" The steep drop in Treasury yields undermined one of the U.S. dollar's major props and pulled its index back to 96.921 , from a recent top of 97.711. The dollar fell to 112.46 yen, from a 113.70 high last week, while the euro nudged up to $1.1379 from a $1.1266 low. In commodity markets, gold held near its recent five-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher interest rates waned. Spot gold stood at $1,248.85 per ounce.

2018-12-18,"NEW YORK, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled more than 5 percent on Tuesday in heavy trade due to fears of oversupply and deteriorating demand, extending a selloff that has taken major crude benchmarks down more than 30 percent from an October peak. U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent both extended declines in post-settlement trade after trade group The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. inventories unexpectedly climbed in the latest week. U.S. crude oil fell $3.64, or 7.3 percent, to settle at $46.24 a barrel, the weakest since August, 2017. In post-close trade, the contract was down 8 percent to $45.91 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent lost $3.35, or 5.62 percent, to settle at $56.26 a barrel. During the session, Brent hit a 14-month low of $56.16. U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 14 to 441.3 million, API said, compared with analysts' expectations for a decrease of 2.4 million barrels. If that build is confirmed by U.S. government data Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. More than 900,000 contracts changed hands on Tuesday, far exceeding the 200-day moving average of 591,000 contracts. Investor confidence is deteriorating, with more fund managers expecting global growth to weaken over the next 12 months, the worst outlook in a decade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's December investor survey showed. ""There was a flood of supply-side news yesterday which, in combination with the demand destruction that the stock market slide implied, got us below $50 (a barrel for U.S. crude), and that gave us a strong sell signal,"" said Bob Yawger, director of futures with Mizuho in New York. World stock markets inched higher as investors focused on the next move for the U.S. Federal Reserve, which kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. Equity markets have had steep declines over the last two months, with several stock sectors having reached bear-market territory. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday amid a host of calls to pause its tightening cycle or risk harming the economy. Among the bearish factors, Britain's largest oilfield restarted production, increasing supply, the U.S. government said output from shale would top 8 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and data suggested U.S. crude inventories would rise this week. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million bpd, equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russian oil output hit a record 11.42 million bpd this month, an industry source told Reuters. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected by year-end to surpass 8 million bpd for the first time, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Britain's largest oilfield, Buzzard, restarted after repairs on pipe work, a spokesman for operator Nexen said on Monday. Buzzard produces about 150,000 bpd and is the largest contributor to the Forties pipeline that brings oil to shore from more than 50 fields. Separately, Libya's state oil firm declared force majeure on operations at the country's largest oilfield, El Sharara. The 315,000 bpd field, located in the southern part of the country, was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds.

The latest wave of energy market selling comes amid reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output. Heightened worries of a possible economic slowdown in 2019 have also added downward pressure to the value of a barrel of oil. ""The only way is down,"" Tamas Varga, senior analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note published Tuesday.

2018-12-18,"Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) declared force majeure on operations at its biggest oilfield late Monday night amid a stand-off with armed protesters, expecting a loss of 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the OPEC member. The protest group, known as the Fezzan Rage Movement, shut down the El Sharara oil field in Libya's impoverished southwest earlier this month with the help of security personnel the Petroleum Facilities Guard, a militia known for its clashes with the Islamic State. The movement of tribesmen is demanding better services, health sector support, monetary stimulus for the southern region and better protection from the government, which it claims has marginalized those living in Libya's south. But while oil prices saw a slight rebound of about 2 percent one week ago on news of the shutdown, crude output from the U.S. is so high it's practically drowned out what would otherwise be a notable disruption in the oil market. Brent crude was trading at 58.54 at 2 p.m. London time on Tuesday, down 1.8 percent on the previous day. ""In terms of the impact on prices, at present it is struggling to overturn the prevailing bearish bias,"" Stephen Brennock of PVM Oil Associates told CNBC on Tuesday. However, he noted, ""any further unexpected outages could inject some much needed bullish impetus into the oil complex."" Oil prices have fallen some 30 percent since hitting year-highs in October on concerns of global oversupply and slowing demand growth. The Energy Information Agency (EIA) projects U.S. shale oil output to top 8 million bpd by the year's end and average a record 12.06 million bpd in 2019. While the crisis does heighten geopolitical risk, said Ehsan Khoman, head of Middle East and North Africa research at MUFG, ""markets remained focused on the more structural concerns that U.S. oil production growth is well north of, and expected to stay, above global demand growth heading into 2019.""

2018-12-18,"Despite falling oil prices, Saudi Arabia will continue paying its citizens cost-of-living allowances, the country's King Salman announced during the unveiling of its 2019 budget on Tuesday. The budget will boost spending even as Saudi Arabia endeavors to close its budget deficit, indicating Riyadh's priority to spur growth in an economy hurt by lower oil prices. State spending will increase by more than 7 percent next year to 1.106 trillion riyals ($295 billion) from 1.030 trillion riyals, in line with a September pre-budget statement, according to the country's finance ministry. Analysts believe the continued cost-of-living allowances, first established in January 2018 and estimated by officials to cost more than $13 billion, are intended to stimulate sluggish growth and shore up support for the royal family and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman after a controversy-ridden few months. The royal allowances of 1,000 riyals a month ($266) are paid to civil servants and military personnel, and other allowances will continue for pensioners and those living on social security. Riyadh will also increase student benefits by 10 percent for the next fiscal year, the king announced. The International Monetary Fund previously forecast the country's budget deficit to shrink to less than 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) next year in the event that the allowances were scrapped. The budget deficit for 2019 will now be 4.2 percent of GDP, according to the government's statement Tuesday.

2018-12-18,"LONDON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell 4 percent on Tuesday after reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output combined with a sharp sell-off in stock markets as the outlook for global growth deteriorated. U.S. crude oil dropped $2.04, or 4.1 percent, to a low of $47.84, its weakest since September 2017, before recovering to around $48.55 by 1140 GMT. North Sea Brent crude lost $2.41, or 4.0 percent, to $57.20, a 14-month low. It last traded around $58.21, down $1.40. Both crude oil benchmarks have shed more than 30 percent since early October due to swelling global inventories. World stock markets tumbled on Tuesday as fears about a slowing global economy gripped investors, just as the U.S. Federal Reserve looked set this week to deliver its fourth interest-rate hike of the year. Germany's Ifo economic institute said its business climate index fell for the fourth month in a row to its lowest in over two years, adding to the worries about global growth. Japan's Nikkei lost 1.8 percent after U.S. stocks dropped to their lowest in more than a year. ""A large part of the move is due to a broader market sell-off, with both U.S. and Asian equity markets coming under pressure,"" said commodities strategist Warren Patterson at Dutch bank ING in Amsterdam. ""Specifically for the oil market, there are no clear signs yet of the market tightening,"" he added. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts won't happen until next month and meanwhile production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia, undermining spot prices. Russian oil output has hit a record 11.42 million bpd this month, an industry source familiar with the data told Reuters. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is by the year-end expected to climb to more than 8 million bpd for the first time, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Monday. Inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point for the oil futures contract, rose more than 1 million barrels from Dec. 11 to 14, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. The United States has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil producer, with total crude output climbing to a record 11.7 million bpd. With prices falling, unprofitable shale producers will eventually stop operating and cut supply, but that could take some time, and meanwhile inventories keep growing.

2018-12-18,"SINGAPORE, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than $1 on Tuesday, dropping for a third session as reports of growing inventory and forecasts of record shale output in the United States stoked worries about oversupply. Concerns over future oil demand amid weakening global economic growth and doubts over the effectiveness of planned production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also pressured prices, traders said. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures were at $58.78 per barrel at 0722 GMT, down 83 cents, or 1.39 percent, from their last close. Brent, which has slipped more than 4 percent in the past three sessions, fell as far as $58.10 a barrel on Tuesday, down more than $1.50 from the previous day's close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 87 cents, or 1.74 percent, at $49.01 per barrel. Both U.S. crude and Brent have shed more than 30 percent since early October due to swelling global inventories, with WTI now trading at levels not seen since October 2017.

2018-12-18,"Oil prices plunged about 7 percent to a more than 15-month low on Tuesday as the United States and Russia continue to pump at record levels even as analysts warn that signs of faltering demand are emerging. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ended the session down $3.64, or 7.3 percent, at $46.24. Losses accelerated ahead of WTI's settlement, with the contract closing at its lowest level since Aug. 30, 2017. U.S. crude fell 8 percent after the settle to a low of $45.79 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell $3.35, or 5.6 percent, to $56.26, a 14-month closing low. It fell to a low of $55.89 after the close. Oil prices are now trading in a zone that could trigger a plunge towards U.S. crude's 2017 low near $42 a barrel, according to John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital. ""There's not a lot of support on the chart between $48 and $42,"" he said. ""Getting the close under $50 was very important on a technical basis. It just fed the negativity.""  From peak to trough, WTI has lost 40 percent of its value since hitting a roughly four-year high in early October. The slump has brought WTI's year-to-date losses to more than 23 percent. Brent has fallen as much as 35 percent since its October high and is down about 16 percent in 2018. U.S. crude futures fell sharply lower on Monday after energy data firm Genscape reported that crude stockpiles at a closely watched storage hub in the Cushing, Oklahoma rose by more than 1 million barrels.  Industry data from the American Petroleum Institute suggests total U.S. crude stockpiles rose by 3.5 million barrels last week, Dow Jones reported. More comprehensive government data will be released on Wednesday morning at 10:30 a.m. ET. This month, oil output from U.S. shale fields is set to rise above 8 million barrels per day for the first time ever, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Monday. Production from the seven key regions is forecast to rise by nearly 134,000 bpd in January, the biggest increase since September. Meanwhile, sources tell Reuters Russia is pumping at 11.42 million bpd this month, a level that would mark an all-time high if confirmed. Russia is the largest producer in an alliance of 10 oil-exporting countries that reached an agreement with OPEC to cut output earlier this month. The roughly two dozen producers began limiting their output last year in order to drain a global crude glut.
