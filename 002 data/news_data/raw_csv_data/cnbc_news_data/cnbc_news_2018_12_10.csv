2018-12-10,"NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Oil fell nearly 2 percent on Monday, echoing the weakness in global stock markets as the focus returned to demand growth concerns and the crude prices erased some of the gains made last week on an OPEC-led decision to cut output. A gauge of global equities stumbled, putting it on track for its fifth straight daily decline, as losses in Europe and Asia extended to Wall Street on new signs the U.S.-China trade spat was impacting world economic growth. The market was also weighed down by confusion stemming from British Prime Minister Theresa May's postponement of a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal and sluggish data from the world's largest economies including the U.S, China, Japan and Germany in recent days. ""The stock market and oil market correlation is back on today,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. ""These worries about the global economy and the demand outlook that follows on that for oil are a bigger and bigger negative for the market."" Brent crude oil futures fell 75 cents to $60.96 a barrel by 11:54 a.m. EST (1654 GMT), while U.S. futures fell 95 cents to $51.66 a barrel. Prices closed 3 percent higher on Friday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers, including heavyweight Russia, said they would cut oil supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January. The deal will be signed in three months' time in Saudi Arabia, when OPEC and its allies will decide on extending the agreement after six months, the UAE's energy minister said on Monday. ""Fridays agreement was a seemingly good one, or maybe we should say the best one under the current circumstances,"" Tamas Varga, a strategist with PVM Oil Associates, said. ""As good as it looks, our view is that it will not be able to provide long-term price supports because it could not help global oil inventories deplete."" Global equities have fallen by nearly 8 percent so far this year, battered by concern about slowing corporate earnings and the threat to the broader economy from an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China. A steep increase in the pace of crude supply growth this year, especially in the world's three largest producers - the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia - has made a number of analysts wary about the prospect of demand being sufficient to mop up extra oil. ""As usual, prices are not a target of OPEC+ policy, but our takeaway is that current price levels largely meet the interests of most participating countries,"" consultant JBC Energy said. Edward Bell of Emirates NBD bank said ""the scale of the cuts ... isn't enough to push the market back into deficit"" and that he expected ""a market surplus of around 1.2 million bpd in Q1 with the new production levels."" Oil prices have fallen sharply since October on signs of an economic slowdown, with Brent losing almost 30 percent in value.

2018-12-10,"Citi believes international oil prices will average $60 a barrel in 2019, remaining near current levels as OPEC-led production cuts encourage U.S. drillers to put more crude on the market. OPEC, Russia and other producers agreed on Friday to remove 1.2 million barrels per day from the market beginning in January. The move follows a more than 30 percent collapse in oil prices that saw international benchmark Brent crude fall from more than $86 a barrel to a 13-month low of $57.50 last month. Some analysts forecast the production cuts will cause Brent to rebound back toward $70 or $80 a barrel. However, Citi says an earlier round of production cuts from the so-called OPEC+ alliance has only delayed the inevitable. Rather than putting oil on a steady upward trajectory, the new supply cuts ""almost certainly"" set up another sell-off.

2018-12-10,"TORONTO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar edged lower against its U.S. counterpart on Monday as oil prices declined and the spread between Canada's two- and five-year yields turned negative for the first time since September 2007. The five-year yield fell 0.6 basis points below the two-year yield. A flat or inverted yield curve could reduce the incentive for banks to lend and hinder investment in the multi-year projects that tend to boost the speed at which an economy can grow. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell in line with further declines in global stock markets, erasing the gains made last week when major producers agreed to cut their crude output from January. U.S. crude prices were down 2.3 percent at $51.4 a  barrel. At 9:36 a.m. (1436 GMT), the Canadian dollar was  trading 0.1 percent lower at 1.3342 to the greenback, or 74.95 U.S. cents. The currency, which touched on Thursday its weakest in nearly 18 months at 1.3445, traded in a range of 1.3294 to 1.3362. The modest decline for the loonie came as the U.S. dollar rose against a basket of major currencies and as the British pound lost ground after British Prime Minister  Theresa May abruptly decided to pull a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal. The loonie was paring some of its gains following stellar jobs data on Friday. Canada added a record number of jobs in November and the unemployment rate dipped to a new all-time low, a performance that analysts said should help ease the Bank of Canada's worries about a recent economic slowdown. On Monday, the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) said that the seasonally adjusted annualized rate of Canadian housing starts increased to 215,941 units from a revised 206,753 units in October. Economists had expected starts to fall to 198,000. In separate data, the value of Canadian building permits edged down by 0.2 percent in October from September, Statistics Canada said. Canadian government bond prices were mixed across a flatter yield curve, with the two-year price down 1.5  Canadian cents to yield 2.01 percent and the 10-year rising 10 Canadian cents to yield 2.063 percent.

2018-12-10,"Russell@ (Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The key concept in the wake of the decision to reduce crude oil output by OPEC and its allies is ""balance"". It's something everybody in the market says they want, but they all have different ideas of what it means and how to get there. Boiled down to the basics, both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the other producers, most notably Russia, are trying to do with the move to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) is achieve their vision of a balanced market. While what this means is not exactly spelled out in unambiguous terms, it's assumed to mean that they want an oil price they believe to be ""fair"" and one that will allow them to meet their fiscal obligations as well as ensuring sufficient incentive for capital spending to maintain future output. What this means for the price of crude oil is less than certain, although it's likely that OPEC and its allies will take the view that the $60.06 a barrel that Brent crude closed at the day before the Dec. 7 output deal was reached is too low. But it's also apparent that in the current climate an oil price above $80 a barrel will result in fairly rapid demand destruction and rising output from producers outside the OPEC orbit. Brent reached a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel on Oct. 3, but a mere eight weeks later it had shed almost 34 percent of its value, hitting a trough of $57.50 on Nov. 28, the lowest level in a year. It's that rapid plunge that led OPEC and its allies to conclude that the market was no longer in balance, and that output needed to be cut to return to the desired, but elusive, state. The market will now get to deliver its verdict on whether OPEC has once again baked a magic pudding that will allow crude prices to rise, but not so high that demand is threatened. The initial price action after the announcement of the deal was mildly positive for OPEC, with Brent jumping as much as $3.67 to $63.73 a barrel during trade on Dec. 7, but eventually it closed at $61.67, up 2.7 percent from the previous day. TRUMP, IRAN The nirvana of balance also means that OPEC, and in particular its largest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia, have to walk a series of political tightropes. The obvious one is also the most public, U.S. President Donald Trump, who is often criticised for changing his mind on issues, but has been remarkably consistent on one front, namely his desire for lower oil prices. It's perhaps no surprise that Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih singled out U.S. energy companies as winners from the OPEC and allies deal, telling reporters at the meeting in Vienna on Dec. 7 that they were ""breathing a sigh of relief"". This was perhaps a not-so-subtle attempt to stave off a blast from Trump on his favoured social media platform Twitter, by reminding him that the powerful U.S. energy lobby is no friend of his push for ever lower oil prices. The Saudis also have to manage their relationship with the United States carefully in the wake of the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's consulate in October. Trump has said he is not convinced the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder, even as leaders of his own Republican Party make noises about imposing stiff sanctions on Saudi Arabia for the killing. A further complicating factor is Iran, which is exempt from the new output-cutting deal, and in theory living on borrowed time given the U.S. waivers on its oil exports are due to expire on April. Given the plethora of competing factors and influences, it would seem balance will be a difficult, if not impossible task in the crude oil market. But how will the success of this latest production cut be measured? If crude remains in a range between $60 and $80 a barrel in the run up to the expiry of the Iran export waivers, then it might be fair to argue that OPEC and its allies will have achieved what they wanted - a floor and a ceiling that everybody can live with.

2018-12-10,"DUBAI, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's oil exports have hit a record high in November, according to data from a leading tanker-tracking company, ahead of an OPEC supply cut deal takes effect next month when shipments from the kingdom are set to fall by more than 1 million barrels per day. Geneva-based Petro-Logistics, which tracks oil supply from OPEC members and other major exporters, put Saudi oil exports at 8.105 million bpd in November up from 7.491 million bpd in October, according to data seen by Reuters. That would suggest that oil exports from Saudi Arabia in December would fall to about 7.6 million bpd and would further drop to around 7 million in January, according to industry sources, as Riyadh follows through on a global deal to cut supply. OPEC and its Russia-led allies agreed on Friday in Vienna to slash oil production by more than the market expected in a bid to shore up prices despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce the price of crude. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in Vienna this week that the kingdom's oil exports would be less than 8 million bpd in December, down from ""the range of 8.3 million bpd"" in November. He also said Saudi Arabia would pump about 10.2 million bpd in January, down from about 10.7 million bpd in December. The kingdom pumped 11.1 million bpd in November.

2018-12-10,"weak@ Group of non-OPEC members led by Russia to cut 400,000 bpd By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil rose on Monday after producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated suppliers last Friday agreed to a supply cut from January. Despite this, the outlook for next year remains muted on the back of an economic slowdown. International Brent crude oil futures were at $62.02 per barrel at 0601 GMT, up 35 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close. Prices surged on Friday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers including heavyweight Russia announced they would cut oil supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), with an 800,000-bpd reduction planned by OPEC members and 400,000 bpd by countries not affiliated with the group. The shutdown of the 315,000-bpd El Sharara oilfield in Libya also helped push Brent, traders said. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were weaker, however, dropping 12 cents from their last settlement to $52.59 per barrel, weighed by surging U.S. output as the booming American oil industry is not taking part in the announced cuts. The OPEC-led supply curbs will be made from January, measured against October 2018 output levels. ""Our key conclusion is that oil prices will be well supported around the $70 per barrel level for 2019,"" analysts at Bernstein Energy said on Monday. Despite the cuts, that was still a price forecast reduction of $6 per barrel as Bernstein lowered its crude oil demand forecast from 1.5 million bpd previously to 1.3 million bpd for 2019. U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said the cut was ""likely sufficient to balance the market in 1H19 and prevent inventories from building."" It added that it expected ""Brent to reach $67.5 per barrel by 2Q19, down from $77.5 before."" Not all analysts expect the cuts to be sufficient to end oversupply. Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD bank, said in a note on Sunday that ""the scale of the cuts...isn't enough to push the market back into deficit"" and that he expected ""a market surplus of around 1.2 million bpd in Q1 with the new production levels."" Oil prices have fallen sharply since October on signs of an economic slowdown, with Brent losing almost 30 percent in value. Japan, the world's third-biggest economy and No.4 oil consumer, on Monday revised its third quarter GDP growth down to an annualized rate of minus 2.5 percent, down from the initial estimate of minus 1.2 percent. Meanwhile the two world's biggest economies, the United States and China, are locked in a trade war which is threatening to slow global growth and battering investor sentiment. Despite the expectations of a slowdown, physical demand on the ground remains healthy. China, the world's biggest oil importer, over the weekend reported November crude oil imports rose 8.5 percent from a year ago, to 10.43 million bpd, marking the first time China imported more than 10 million bpd. That leaves the world's second-biggest economy on track to set yet another annual import record. Strong demand is being driven by Chinese purchases for strategic reserves, but also by new refineries, triggering excess supply of fuels, filling up storage tanks and eroding refinery profits across Asia.

2018-12-10,"Oil prices fell 3 percent on Monday, echoing the weakness in global stock markets as the focus returned to demand growth concerns. Crude prices erased the gains they made on Friday following an OPEC-led decision to cut output. Losses in Europe and Asia extended to Wall Street on new signs the U.S.-China trade spat was impacting world economic growth. The market was also weighed down by confusion stemming from British Prime Minister Theresa May's postponement of a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal and sluggish data from the world's largest economies including the U.S, China, Japan and Germany in recent days. ""The stock market and oil market correlation is back on today,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. ""These worries about the global economy and the demand outlook that follows on that for oil are a bigger and bigger negative for the market."" U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ended Monday's session down $1.61, or 3.1 percent, at $51 a barrel.

2018-12-10,"weak@ Group of non-OPEC members led by Russia to cut 400,000 bpd By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil rose on Monday after producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated suppliers last Friday agreed to a supply cut from January. Despite this, the outlook for next year remains muted on the back of an economic slowdown. International Brent crude oil futures were at $62.02 per barrel at 0601 GMT, up 35 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close. Prices surged on Friday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers including heavyweight Russia announced they would cut oil supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), with an 800,000-bpd reduction planned by OPEC members and 400,000 bpd by countries not affiliated with the group. The shutdown of the 315,000-bpd El Sharara oilfield in Libya also helped push Brent, traders said. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were weaker, however, dropping 12 cents from their last settlement to $52.59 per barrel, weighed by surging U.S. output as the booming American oil industry is not taking part in the announced cuts. The OPEC-led supply curbs will be made from January, measured against October 2018 output levels. ""Our key conclusion is that oil prices will be well supported around the $70 per barrel level for 2019,"" analysts at Bernstein Energy said on Monday. Despite the cuts, that was still a price forecast reduction of $6 per barrel as Bernstein lowered its crude oil demand forecast from 1.5 million bpd previously to 1.3 million bpd for 2019. U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said the cut was ""likely sufficient to balance the market in 1H19 and prevent inventories from building."" It added that it expected ""Brent to reach $67.5 per barrel by 2Q19, down from $77.5 before."" Not all analysts expect the cuts to be sufficient to end oversupply. Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD bank, said in a note on Sunday that ""the scale of the cuts...isn't enough to push the market back into deficit"" and that he expected ""a market surplus of around 1.2 million bpd in Q1 with the new production levels."" Oil prices have fallen sharply since October on signs of an economic slowdown, with Brent losing almost 30 percent in value. Japan, the world's third-biggest economy and No.4 oil consumer, on Monday revised its third quarter GDP growth down to an annualized rate of minus 2.5 percent, down from the initial estimate of minus 1.2 percent. Meanwhile the two world's biggest economies, the United States and China, are locked in a trade war which is threatening to slow global growth and battering investor sentiment. Despite the expectations of a slowdown, physical demand on the ground remains healthy. China, the world's biggest oil importer, over the weekend reported November crude oil imports rose 8.5 percent from a year ago, to 10.43 million bpd, marking the first time China imported more than 10 million bpd. That leaves the world's second-biggest economy on track to set yet another annual import record. Strong demand is being driven by Chinese purchases for strategic reserves, but also by new refineries, triggering excess supply of fuels, filling up storage tanks and eroding refinery profits across Asia.
