2018-12-19,"WTI may retest support of $45.94 per barrel -Reuters analyst BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday to erase most of their gains from the day before, resuming declines seen earlier in the week amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy. The front-month U.S. crude contract had dropped more than $1, or 2.24 percent, to $47.10 per barrel by 0423 GMT, offseting gains of 96 cents chalked up on Wednesday. International benchmark Brent crude futures were down over $1, or 1.82 percent, at $56.20 per barrel, after climbing almost 2 percent the session before. ""Wednesday's recovery was short-covering. Investors quickly moved their attention to deteriorating fundamentals in the oil markets including more signs of slowing economic growth next year, record production and the lack of confidence with OPEC's pledge to curb production,"" said Xi Jiarui, chief oil analyst at consultancy JLC. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. Oil prices are down more than 30 percent from peaks seen in October. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said he expected global oil stocks to fall by the end of the first quarter, but added that the market remained vulnerable to political and economic factors as well as speculation. Technical analysis showed U.S. oil may retest support at $45.94 per barrel, a break below which could cause a loss to $44.43, Reuters market analyst Wang Tao wrote on Thursday. SQUARING UP Volatility in crude prices this week has driven investors to shut their positions and is draining liquidity from the market, Xi said. Total market open interest in U.S. crude contracts had fallen to 2.063 million contracts as of Thursday, up from a record of 2.71 million in May. ""It has been a tumultuous week in oil markets and traders may opt to shut it down after the last big risk event of the year with year-end position-squaring likely to kick-in today,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA. Innes was referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting of 2018, at which it suggested the U.S. economy no longer needed the central bank's support either through lower-than-normal interest rates or by maintaining a massive balance sheet. But U.S. inventory data offered some support to WTI prices. U.S. crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected. The decline was the third consecutive decrease. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 4.2 million barrels, versus expectations of a 573,000-barrel increase, the EIA said. Distillate demand rose to the highest since January 2003, which bolstered buying, particularly in heating oil futures, the market's proxy for diesel.

2018-12-19,"Poland took another step towards weening itself off Russian energy supplies on Wednesday by signing a 20-year agreement with San Diego-based Sempra Energy to import U.S. liquefied natural gas. The signing marks the third long-term contract the state-controlled Polish Oil and Gas Company, or PGNiG, has inked with an American LNG company this year. In the coming years, Warsaw plans to replace Russian gas with pipeline supplies from Norway and shipments of LNG, or gas super-chilled to liquid from for transport by sea. That is opening an opportunity for the U.S. energy industry, which is on the cusp of a opening a second wave of LNG export terminals. The Trump administration, eager to dominate the global energy market, has been pitching the supplies in trade talks from Beijing to Warsaw. Eastern and Central European nations, which have a complicated and frequently antagonistic relationship with Moscow, have been a receptive audience. ""This is a big deal,"" said Assistant Secretary Francis Fannon, who heads the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources.

2018-12-19,"budget-finmin@ RIYADH, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's finance minister said on Wednesday he was unconcerned with current oil prices impacting spending plans in 2019, and the government still aims to close its budget deficit by 2023 though the target is not set in stone. Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters cash settlements from an anti-corruption campaign, which generated 50 billion Saudi riyals ($13.3 billion) in 2018, would net ""not significantly less"" in 2019. The authorities have said they expect to confiscate more than $100 billion overall from a purge of princes, ministers and business tycoons ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November 2017. ""We have a figure for the budget, but I cant tell you what it is. It's what we received from the attorney general as most likely to be coming our way,"" Jadaan said in an interview at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where suspects in the corruption sweep were held for up to three months. For three years - ever since Riyadh ran an eye-popping deficit of 367 billion riyals ($98 billion) in 2015, threatening its financial stability - fiscal policy focused to a large extent on reassuring markets by cutting the deficit. Under an ambitious reform plan aimed at ending dependence on crude, the world's top oil exporter is seeking a balanced budget by 2023. The government unveiled a 1.11 trillion Saudi riyal ($295 billion) budget on Tuesday, the kingdom's largest, with a seven percent increase in state spending to spur economic growth and a projected deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP. ""We are still targeting 2023, but what I'm saying is we need to realize that it is not set in stone,"" Jadaan said. ""What's the point of having a balanced budget on 23 specifically? It could be 22, it could be 24. We want to be disciplined, we want to be efficient and pro-growth."" He said the ministry plans to borrow more locally than internationally, and would issue bonds mainly in U.S. dollars but is considering venturing into other currencies including euro and yen. Asked about the impact of lower oil prices on spending, Jadaan said: ""Until today we are comfortable"" and ""even in the worst case scenario we are still relatively comfortable"" given the kingdom's significant reserves and low debt to GDP ratio. Saudi Arabia does not disclose the oil price assumptions on which its planning is based, but economists have estimated the 2019 budget implied Brent at $70-71 per barrel with oil production at 10.2 million barrels per day. Oil stabilised on Wednesday after one of its biggest falls in years, but remained under pressure from oversupply and concern a slowing global economy would depress demand. CORRUPTION SETTLEMENTS Jadaan said seized assets were being managed and valued by a ministry-owned company, Istidama, run by a committee chaired by the commerce minister and with no connection to the sovereign wealth body, the Public Investment Fund. ""Some of them are liquid assets, so they liquidate them when the market is right. Some of them are more sticky assets in real estate and other private investments that they will then consider what are they going to do with,"" he said. Construction giant Saudi Binladin Group (SBG), in which the government took a roughly one-third stake under the campaign, will soon have a ""normal board"" with family members and representatives of government ownership, according to Jadaan. A five-member committee charged with restructuring the company's governance ""is about now to conclude,"" most likely in 2019, he said. ""It's a transition. That committee is just a temporary supervisory committee until the governance is sorted out."" Asked about the possibility of listing SBG on the stock market, he said: ""A company with this kind of business you can't list for some time. It will need some time to go through restructuring, make it more business ready."" Reuters reported in September that the family-run company had ended up on a collision course with the government after chairman Bakr Binladin and his shareholder brothers resisted earlier pressure to list. Other businessmen rounded up in the corruption sweep have ceded shares in publicly-listed companies among other settlements. Among those detained was billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who said in March he had reached an agreement with the government for his release, without disclosing details of the ""confirmed understanding"". Asked about the government's seizure of shares in publicly-traded companies under corruption settlements, Jadaan said: ""If it is not on Tadawul (stock exchange), we don't own it.""

2018-12-19,"NEW YORK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, recovering somewhat from a sharp selloff during the previous session, after U.S. data showed strong demand for refined products. Sentiment remained negative, however, as investors grappled with weakening demand and worries about oversupply. Brent crude futures were up 61 cents at $56.87 a barrel, a 1.1 percent gain, by 2:21 p.m. EST (1921 GMT). The front-month U.S. light crude contract, which expires on Wednesday, was $1.19 higher at $47.43 a barrel, a 2.6 percent gain. The second-month contract was up $1.07 a barrel.

Heating oil futures gained about 2.7 percent to $1.8012 a gallon. ""The complex is piecing together a modest advance so far today but only one that offsets a miniscule portion of recent losses,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. The markets slumped on Tuesday, extending recent declines. Global benchmark Brent tumbled to a session low of $55.89 a barrel, a bottom last reached in October 2017. WTI sank to $45.79, the weakest since August 2017. Broader financial markets have been under pressure on worries about higher U.S. interest rates. As expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and noted that ""some"" further gradual rate hikes would be needed. Oil prices pared gains following the decision as the U.S. dollar index trimmed losses. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. ""There's slight disappointment that the Fed is not done (raising rates),"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""People are a little bit concerned that if the Fed raises the rates, that could slow the economy and hurt oil demand at the same time."" Brent and WTI have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of October as crude supply has increased.

2018-12-19,"If Tuesday's collapse in U.S. crude prices below $46 a barrel looked ugly, try being a driller in the Permian Basin, the epicenter of the U.S. shale oil boom. Crude is trading at about $40 a barrel in the western Texas region that sits atop most of the Permian Basin. At that price, oil is selling for less than the cost of developing new wells, raising concerns for a region that emerged from a bruising downturn just two years ago. ""When you get down below $40 a barrel in the Permian, you are talking about a potential recession in a sector that you probably never ever thought might be prone to a recession in 2019,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at fuel price service OPIS.

2018-12-19,"Oil prices stabilized on Wednesday after a ""toxic mix"" of market forces triggered one of the biggest falls for years. However, despite a protracted sell-off in crude futures, the meteoric rise of U.S. shale should continue undeterred over the coming months, analysts told CNBC. ""In short, as much as the recent price slump has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty, it is unlikely to derail the U.S. shale engine,"" Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note published Wednesday. ""The fact is that U.S. tight oil supply is expected to expand by at least 1 million bpd in 2019. In doing so, it will go a long way to cementing America's newfound position as the world's biggest oil producer."" ""For now, when it comes to the U.S. shale patch, the glory days are far from over,"" Brennock said. Since climbing to four-year highs in early October, crude futures have tumbled by more than a third. The latest wave of heavy selling comes at a time when the energy market as well as the global economy is gripped by a flurry of bearish factors. Heightened concerns of oversupply, reports of swelling inventories, forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output and intensifying concerns about a slowing global economy have all placed downward pressure on the value of a barrel of oil. International benchmark Brent crude traded at around $56.61 on Wednesday, up around 0.6 percent, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at around $46.59, more than 0.75 percent higher.

2018-12-19,"Britain's BP has launched the sale of U.S. oil and gas onshore assets that could raise more than $3 billion to help pay for other fields in the United States it bought in October from BHP, industry and banking sources said. The sale proceeds will partly fund the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's onshore assets that are mostly around oil-producing fields in Texas and Louisiana. BP had said it would sell $5 billion to $6 billion to finance the deal. The London-listed firm wants to focus on production from its holdings in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to match rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron whose production there is set to rise sharply in coming years. BP's onshore business, which it has rebranded as BPX, sent out information packages last week on the assets it was selling and its representatives held a meeting in New York with the management teams of potential buyers, the sources said. This follows a series of informal talks the company held with private equity firms since the end of November aimed at gauging interest in the assets, two of the sources said. Interested parties include U.S. buyout funds Carlyle and Warburg Pincus, one of the sources said. BP, which sources said was not using a banking advisor on the sale, declined to comment. Carlyle and Warburg Pincus were not immediately available for comment. Investors have been stepping up pressure on publicly traded oil firms to curb spending and boost returns. ""That pressure is taking public companies out of the universe of buyers in the market, creating opportunities for private-equity companies,"" said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at researcher Drillinginfo. Private equity firms such as Ascent Resources, Aethon Energy Management and Encino Acquisition Partners have all made large purchases of oil-producing assets this year. BP is offering seven packages, all of them consisting of shale assets it held before the BHP deal, two of the sources said. Those include fields in the San Juan basin which straddles the Colorado-New Mexico border, the Cotton Valley field in East Texas, the Arkoma and Anadarko basins in Oklahoma, and the Wamsutter basin in Wyoming. There are a small number of non-operated stakes being offloaded, the sources said. The most attractive pieces are thought to be the San Juan assets, which include around 9,000 operated and non-operated wells and were the backbone of BP's U.S. onshore operations prior to the BHP deal, along with the Wamsutter basin.

Most of the assets are gas-rich, which could deter some investors at a time when the abundance of gas production across the United States has pushed down prices for the fuel. The Permian, encompassing parts of Texas and New Mexico, is at the heart of the U.S. shale boom and has some of the lowest production costs in North America, which is valuable when U.S. WTI crude prices CLc1 have slumped almost 40 percent since reaching a peak in October.

2018-12-19,"LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Global equity and crude oil markets attempted on Wednesday to claw their way out of a three-day long plunge that saw investors seek out the safety of bonds amid mounting pessimism over world growth. Oil's spectacular fall - down almost 10 percent since last Thursday - and world stocks' plunge to 19-month lows have spurred speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve might be done with tightening after its policy meeting later in the day. While Brent crude inched up 0.5 percent to $56.5 a barrel after plunging 6 percent overnight, its 35 percent fall since October is sending a disinflationary pulse through the world just as trade and economic activity are cooling. The latest jolt on the growth front came from Japan which said its export growth slowed to a crawl in November, an ominous signal for the trade-focused economy. And on Tuesday, logistics and delivery firm FedEx, considered a bellwether for the world economy, slashed its 2019 forecasts, noting ""ongoing deceleration"" in global growth. European shares rose 0.3 percent and MSCI's global equity index firmed a touch, though it has fallen 6 percent since the start of this month, given the fragile nature of the Sino-U.S. tariff truce and signs that company earnings worldwide are slowing. While equity futures signal a stronger opening on Wall Street, U.S. stocks are set for their worst December since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. https://tmsnrt.rs/2A3z5ML ""It's a confluence of several important factors: the market is adjusting its outlook on growth and there is a consensus we will see a slowdown. More importantly, the market is adjusting to the idea this will translate into lower earnings growth,"" said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for private banking at Union Bancaire Privee in Zurich. ""It's being complicated by the tightening liquidity situation with the Fed expected to move today and the ECB having signalled the end of its (stimulus)"". Futures are sticking with a two-in-three chance of a rate rise on Wednesday and Villamin expects the Fed to move twice in 2019. That's a more hawkish call than the broader market which is pricing less than one rise in 2019, down from three not long back. The expectations of a Fed pause and the equity selloff sent 10-year Treasury yields to the lowest since August at 2.799 percent - down 20 basis points in December - while two-year yields touched a three-month trough of 2.629 percent, sliding from November's 2.977 percent peak. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. Reasons for the bond rally were easy to find. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's closely watched monthly survey found more than half of its participants now flagging a global economic slowdown next year. It also showed the third biggest decline in inflation expectations on record. The poll also revealed the largest ever one-month rotation into fixed-income assets, their gains coming at the expense of equities. The steep drop in Treasury yields undermined one of the U.S. dollar's major props and pulled its index back 0.3 percent to 96.8, from a recent top of 97.711. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.15 percent to 112.37 yen , while the euro nudged up to $1.1383 from a $1.1266 low. Villamin of UBP said that while uncertainty had grown about the Fed's rate rise path, other currencies from the yen to the euro still lacked interest rate support. ""Why the dollar won't be too weak is that the alternatives are not attractive,"" he said. ""The only real attractive currency out there is the dollar ... we think dollar strength will stay another 3-6 months."" U.S. futures pointed to a firmer Wall Street opening. The bright spot on world markets is Italy where bond yields continued their fall after Rome struck a deal with the EU Commission over its contentious 2019 budget, signalling an end to weeks of wrangling. The Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap - a measure of Italian risk - narrowed to around 255 bps, the tightest since late September. That spread had been over 300 bps as recently as end-November. ""Everyone was expecting an agreement to be reached, but many people were expecting this to come in Q1 or Q2 next year,"" said Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister. ""With risk sentiment stabilising this morning, it looks like the momentum can increase in Italian bonds.""

2018-12-19,"Austria's OMV is the latest firm to join an international cluster of energy multinationals helping the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its push toward gas self-sufficiency. ADNOC, the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, has awarded OMV a 5 percent stake in the development of its Ghasha concession, ADNOC's offshore ultra-sour gas mega project. Development will cover Hail, Ghasha, Dalma, and other natural gas fields offshore Abu Dhabi. The Vienna-based oil and gas company joins Italy's ENI and Germany's Wintershall as partners to ADNOC — ENI and Wintershall earlier this month were awarded a 25 percent share and 10 percent share of the concession, respectively. OMV's 5 percent constitutes the remainder of the 40 percent of the Ghasha concession earmarked for foreign investors. ADNOC's latest move underscores its integrated gas strategy, a plan to gradually develop its sizable gas reserves and bring the UAE to gas self-sufficiency, which it hopes will ultimately enable its transition from a net importer of natural gas to a net exporter. Abu Dhabi expects the project to produce over 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas per day when it comes on stream around the middle of the next decade — enough to provide electricity to more than 2 million homes, the ADNOC's press release said. Once complete, executives predict it will also produce over 120,000 barrels of oil and high-value condensates daily.

2018-12-19,"LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Oil stabilised on Wednesday after one of its biggest falls for years, but remained under pressure from oversupply and concern that a slowing global economy would depress demand for fuel. Benchmark Brent crude oil was up 30 cents at $56.56 a barrel by 0840 GMT, after dropping 5.6 percent on Tuesday and at one point hitting a 14-month low. U.S. light crude was 20 cents higher at $46.44, after plunging 7.3 percent in the previous session when it touched its lowest since August 2017. Both benchmarks have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of October as crude supply from the Middle East, Russia and the United States has outstripped demand, filling oil tanks. ""The market is experiencing price carnage, maximum pain and considerable downside pressure,"" said Robin Bieber, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil. ""The trend is down."" Tuesday's sell-off was encouraged by a sharp fall in world stock markets after signs that economic growth, and hence demand for energy, was slowing. There were also worries that higher U.S. interest rates could slow U.S. growth. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday. The central bank is due to announce its decision at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). Adding to worries about oversupply, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday that U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, while gasoline inventories increased. If the build in U.S. crude stockpiles is confirmed by U.S. government data on Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million bpd, equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russian oil output is at a record 11.42 million bpd so far this month, an industry source told Reuters. The U.S. government has said shale production should climb to over 8 million bpd for the first time by the end of December. Global oil supply faces pockets of disruption. In Libya, the state oil company declared force majeure at its largest oilfield. That came a week after the firm announced a contractual waiver on exports from the field following its seizure by protesters.

2018-12-19,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices clawed back some ground on Wednesday as global equity markets showed signs of stabilizing, but crude was still under pressure from worries about oversupply and a slowing global economy that had driven sharp losses in the last three sessions. West Texas Intermediate futures (WTI) had climbed 7 cents, or 0.15 percent, to $46.31 per barrel by 0722 GMT, after plunging 7.3 percent the day before in a session when it touched its lowest since August 2017. Global benchmark Brent crude futures rose 0.36 percent, or 20 cents, to $56.46 per barrel. They dropped 5.6 percent on Tuesday, at one point hitting a 14-month low. Brent is down more than 30 percent from a recent peak of $86.74 per barrel on Oct. 3, while WTI has declined nearly 40 percent from a multi-year high of $76.9 per barrel recorded on Oct. 4. ""(WTI prices are holding on Wednesday as) traders look for some solace in U.S. equity markets as risk sentiment appears to be stabilizing,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA ""But we are far removed from any bullish flip in investor sentiment."" The S&P 500 ended up slightly on Tuesday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.35 percent as both indices ended losing streaks. Further adding to the oversupply concerns, the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday said U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, while gasoline inventories increased. If the build in crude stockpiles is confirmed by U.S. government data on Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. Meanwhile, analysts said that upcoming output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had so far failed to stimulate the market as they were not due to kick in until next month. Output from de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia as well as the United States and Russia - leading producers outside the group - has been at or near record highs. The U.S. government said shale production is expected to climb to over 8 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time by the end of December. Russian oil output is at a record 11.42 million bpd so far this month, an industry source told Reuters. However, there were some factors tightening supply, with Libya's state oil company declaring force majeure at the country's largest oilfield. That came a week after the firm announced a contractual waiver on exports from the field following its seizure by protesters. Elsewhere, a speech marking 40 years of market liberalization by Chinese President Xi Jinping offered no specific support measures for the second-largest economy, disappointing investors who were expecting fiscal policy loosening and a tax cut. China's Shanghai crude futures fell 5.8 percent to trade at 389.4 yuan ($56.53) per barrel on Wednesday, the lowest since their launch in March. Oil market investors were also turning their attention to the outcome of a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve that is due to end on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to raise U.S. interest rates for the fourth time this year though the central bank may temper the outlook for further increases in 2019 due to concerns about the economy.

2018-12-19,"Poland took another step towards weening itself off Russian energy supplies on Wednesday by signing a 20-year agreement with San Diego-based Sempra Energy to import U.S. liquefied natural gas. The signing marks the third long-term contract the state-controlled Polish Oil and Gas Company, or PGNiG, has inked with an American LNG company this year. In the coming years, Warsaw plans to replace Russian gas with pipeline supplies from Norway and shipments of LNG, or gas super-chilled to liquid from for transport by sea. That is opening an opportunity for the U.S. energy industry, which is on the cusp of a opening a second wave of LNG export terminals. The Trump administration, eager to dominate the global energy market, has been pitching the supplies in trade talks from Beijing to Warsaw.

2018-12-19,"budget-finmin@ RIYADH, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's finance minister said on Wednesday he was unconcerned with current oil prices impacting spending plans in 2019, and the government still aims to close its budget deficit by 2023 though the target is not set in stone. Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters cash settlements from an anti-corruption campaign, which generated 50 billion Saudi riyals ($13.3 billion) in 2018, would net ""not significantly less"" in 2019. The authorities have said they expect to confiscate more than $100 billion overall from a purge of princes, ministers and business tycoons ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November 2017. ""We have a figure for the budget, but I cant tell you what it is. It's what we received from the attorney general as most likely to be coming our way,"" Jadaan said in an interview at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where suspects in the corruption sweep were held for up to three months. For three years - ever since Riyadh ran an eye-popping deficit of 367 billion riyals ($98 billion) in 2015, threatening its financial stability - fiscal policy focused to a large extent on reassuring markets by cutting the deficit. Under an ambitious reform plan aimed at ending dependence on crude, the world's top oil exporter is seeking a balanced budget by 2023. The government unveiled a 1.11 trillion Saudi riyal ($295 billion) budget on Tuesday, the kingdom's largest, with a seven percent increase in state spending to spur economic growth and a projected deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP. ""We are still targeting 2023, but what I'm saying is we need to realize that it is not set in stone,"" Jadaan said. ""What's the point of having a balanced budget on 23 specifically? It could be 22, it could be 24. We want to be disciplined, we want to be efficient and pro-growth."" He said the ministry plans to borrow more locally than internationally, and would issue bonds mainly in U.S. dollars but is considering venturing into other currencies including euro and yen. Asked about the impact of lower oil prices on spending, Jadaan said: ""Until today we are comfortable"" and ""even in the worst case scenario we are still relatively comfortable"" given the kingdom's significant reserves and low debt to GDP ratio. Saudi Arabia does not disclose the oil price assumptions on which its planning is based, but economists have estimated the 2019 budget implied Brent at $70-71 per barrel with oil production at 10.2 million barrels per day. Oil stabilised on Wednesday after one of its biggest falls in years, but remained under pressure from oversupply and concern a slowing global economy would depress demand. CORRUPTION SETTLEMENTS Jadaan said seized assets were being managed and valued by a ministry-owned company, Istidama, run by a committee chaired by the commerce minister and with no connection to the sovereign wealth body, the Public Investment Fund. ""Some of them are liquid assets, so they liquidate them when the market is right. Some of them are more sticky assets in real estate and other private investments that they will then consider what are they going to do with,"" he said. Construction giant Saudi Binladin Group (SBG), in which the government took a roughly one-third stake under the campaign, will soon have a ""normal board"" with family members and representatives of government ownership, according to Jadaan. A five-member committee charged with restructuring the company's governance ""is about now to conclude,"" most likely in 2019, he said. ""It's a transition. That committee is just a temporary supervisory committee until the governance is sorted out."" Asked about the possibility of listing SBG on the stock market, he said: ""A company with this kind of business you can't list for some time. It will need some time to go through restructuring, make it more business ready."" Reuters reported in September that the family-run company had ended up on a collision course with the government after chairman Bakr Binladin and his shareholder brothers resisted earlier pressure to list. Other businessmen rounded up in the corruption sweep have ceded shares in publicly-listed companies among other settlements. Among those detained was billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who said in March he had reached an agreement with the government for his release, without disclosing details of the ""confirmed understanding"". Asked about the government's seizure of shares in publicly-traded companies under corruption settlements, Jadaan said: ""If it is not on Tadawul (stock exchange), we don't own it.""

2018-12-19,"NEW YORK, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, recovering somewhat from a sharp selloff during the previous session, after U.S. data showed strong demand for refined products. Sentiment remained negative, however, as investors grappled with weakening demand and worries about oversupply. Brent crude futures were up 61 cents at $56.87 a barrel, a 1.1 percent gain, by 2:21 p.m. EST (1921 GMT). The front-month U.S. light crude contract, which expires on Wednesday, was $1.19 higher at $47.43 a barrel, a 2.6 percent gain. The second-month contract was up $1.07 a barrel. Crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected. The decline was the third consecutive decrease, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 4.2 million barrels, versus expectations of a 573,000-barrel increase, the EIA said. Distillate demand rose to the highest since January 2003, which bolstered buying, particularly in heating oil futures, the market's proxy for diesel. Heating oil futures gained about 2.7 percent to $1.8012 a gallon. ""The complex is piecing together a modest advance so far today but only one that offsets a miniscule portion of recent losses,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. The markets slumped on Tuesday, extending recent declines. Global benchmark Brent tumbled to a session low of $55.89 a barrel, a bottom last reached in October 2017. WTI sank to $45.79, the weakest since August 2017. Broader financial markets have been under pressure on worries about higher U.S. interest rates. As expected, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and noted that ""some"" further gradual rate hikes would be needed. Oil prices pared gains following the decision as the U.S. dollar index trimmed losses. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. ""There's slight disappointment that the Fed is not done (raising rates),"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""People are a little bit concerned that if the Fed raises the rates, that could slow the economy and hurt oil demand at the same time."" Brent and WTI have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of October as crude supply has increased. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russian oil output has been running at a record 11.42 million bpd so far this month, an industry source told Reuters.

2018-12-19,"balanced budget-finmin@ (Adds details, background) RIYADH, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's finance minister said on Wednesday he was not concerned about current oil prices impacting spending plans in 2019, and the government still aims to close its budget deficit by 2023 although the target is not set in stone. Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters in an interview that cash settlements from an anti-corruption campaign, which generated 50 billion Saudi riyals ($13.3 billion) in 2018, would net ""not significantly less"" in 2019. The authorities have said they expect to confiscate $100 billion overall from a purge of princes, ministers and business tycoons ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November 2017. Under an ambitious reform plan aimed at ending the top oil exporter's dependence on crude, Riyadh is seeking to balance its budget by 2023. The government unveiled a 1.11 trillion Saudi riyal ($295 billion) budget on Tuesday, the kingdom's largest, with a seven percent increase in state spending to spur economic growth and a projected deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP. ""We are still targeting 2023, but what I'm saying is we need to realize that it is not set in stone,"" Jadaan said. ""What's the point of having a balanced budget on 23 specifically? It could be 22, it could be 24. We want to be disciplined, we want to be efficient and pro-growth."" He said the ministry plans to borrow more locally than internationally, and would issue bonds mainly in U.S. dollar but is considering venturing into other currencies including Euro and Yen. Asked about the impact of lower oil prices on spending, Jadaan said: ""Until today we are comfortable"" and ""even in the worst case scenario we are still relatively comfortable"" given the kingdom's significant reserves and low debt to GDP ratio. The interview took place at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, where suspects in the corruption sweep were held for up to three months. Jadaan said seized assets were being managed and valued by a ministry-owned company, Istidama, which is managed by a committee chaired by the commerce minister and has no connection to the sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. Construction giant Saudi Binladin Group (SBG), in which the government took a roughly one-third stake under the campaign, will soon have a ""normal board"" with family members and representatives of government ownership, he said. A five-member committee charged with restructuring the company's governance ""is about now to conclude,"" most likely in 2019, he said. ""It's a transition. That committee is just a temporary supervisory committee until the governance is sorted out."" Asked about the government's seizure of shares in publicly-traded companies under corruption settlements, Jadaan said: ""If it is not on Tadawul, we don't own it.""

Sentiment remained negative, however, as investors grappled with weakening demand and worries about oversupply. Brent crude futures rose 97 cents, 1.7 percent, to $57.23 a barrel, by 12:57 p.m. EST (1757 GMT). The front-month U.S. light crude contract, which expires on Wednesday, rose $1.56, or 3.4 percent, to $47.80 a barrel. The second-month contract rose $1.33 a barrel. Crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected. The decline was the third consecutive decrease, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 4.2 million barrels, versus expectations for a 573,000-barrel increase, the EIA said. Distillate demand rose to the highest since January 2003, which bolstered buying, particularly in heating oil futures, the market's proxy for diesel. Heating oil futures gained about 3 percent to $1.807 a gallon.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday as it winds up a policy meeting, with a decision set to be announced at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). Both Brent and WTI have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of October as crude supply has increased. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices.

Crude is trading at about $40 a barrel in the western Texas region that sits atop most of the Permian Basin. At that price, oil is selling for less than the cost of developing new wells, raising concerns for a region that emerged from a bruising downturn just two years ago. ""When you get down below $40 a barrel in the Permian, you are talking about a potential recession in a sector that you probably never ever thought might be prone to a recession in 2019,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at fuel price service OPIS.

2018-12-19,"Oil prices stabilized on Wednesday after a ""toxic mix"" of market forces triggered one of the biggest falls for years. However, despite a protracted sell-off in crude futures, the meteoric rise of U.S. shale should continue undeterred over the coming months, analysts told CNBC. ""In short, as much as the recent price slump has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty, it is unlikely to derail the U.S. shale engine,"" Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates, said in a research note published Wednesday. ""The fact is that U.S. tight oil supply is expected to expand by at least 1 million bpd in 2019. In doing so, it will go a long way to cementing America's newfound position as the world's biggest oil producer."" ""For now, when it comes to the U.S. shale patch, the glory days are far from over,"" Brennock said. Since climbing to four-year highs in early October, crude futures have tumbled by more than a third. The latest wave of heavy selling comes at a time when the energy market as well as the global economy is gripped by a flurry of bearish factors. Heightened concerns of oversupply, reports of swelling inventories, forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output and intensifying concerns about a slowing global economy have all placed downward pressure on the value of a barrel of oil. International benchmark Brent crude traded at around $56.61 on Wednesday, up around 0.6 percent, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at around $46.59, more than 0.75 percent higher.

2018-12-19,"Britain's BP has launched the sale of U.S. oil and gas onshore assets that could raise more than $3 billion to help pay for other fields in the United States it bought in October from BHP, industry and banking sources said. The sale proceeds will partly fund the $10.5 billion acquisition of BHP's onshore assets that are mostly around oil-producing fields in Texas and Louisiana. BP had said it would sell $5 billion to $6 billion to finance the deal. The London-listed firm wants to focus on production from its holdings in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins to match rivals Exxon Mobil and Chevron whose production there is set to rise sharply in coming years. BP's onshore business, which it has rebranded as BPX, sent out information packages last week on the assets it was selling and its representatives held a meeting in New York with the management teams of potential buyers, the sources said. This follows a series of informal talks the company held with private equity firms since the end of November aimed at gauging interest in the assets, two of the sources said. Interested parties include U.S. buyout funds Carlyle and Warburg Pincus, one of the sources said. BP, which sources said was not using a banking advisor on the sale, declined to comment. Carlyle and Warburg Pincus were not immediately available for comment. Investors have been stepping up pressure on publicly traded oil firms to curb spending and boost returns. ""That pressure is taking public companies out of the universe of buyers in the market, creating opportunities for private-equity companies,"" said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at researcher Drillinginfo. Private equity firms such as Ascent Resources, Aethon Energy Management and Encino Acquisition Partners have all made large purchases of oil-producing assets this year. BP is offering seven packages, all of them consisting of shale assets it held before the BHP deal, two of the sources said. Those include fields in the San Juan basin which straddles the Colorado-New Mexico border, the Cotton Valley field in East Texas, the Arkoma and Anadarko basins in Oklahoma, and the Wamsutter basin in Wyoming. There are a small number of non-operated stakes being offloaded, the sources said. The most attractive pieces are thought to be the San Juan assets, which include around 9,000 operated and non-operated wells and were the backbone of BP's U.S. onshore operations prior to the BHP deal, along with the Wamsutter basin. The sales document says the entire portfolio generates around $700 million in operating cashflow a year. Most of the assets are gas-rich, which could deter some investors at a time when the abundance of gas production across the United States has pushed down prices for the fuel. The Permian, encompassing parts of Texas and New Mexico, is at the heart of the U.S. shale boom and has some of the lowest production costs in North America, which is valuable when U.S. WTI crude prices CLc1 have slumped almost 40 percent since reaching a peak in October. U.S. shale production is forecast to hit 8.2 million bpd in January, according to the U.S. Energy Department, as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, drives U.S. output to a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd), making it the world's biggest crude producer.

2018-12-19,"LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Global equity and crude oil markets attempted on Wednesday to claw their way out of a three-day long plunge that saw investors seek out the safety of bonds amid mounting pessimism over world growth. Oil's spectacular fall - down almost 10 percent since last Thursday - and world stocks' plunge to 19-month lows have spurred speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve might be done with tightening after its policy meeting later in the day. While Brent crude inched up 0.5 percent to $56.5 a barrel after plunging 6 percent overnight, its 35 percent fall since October is sending a disinflationary pulse through the world just as trade and economic activity are cooling. The latest jolt on the growth front came from Japan which said its export growth slowed to a crawl in November, an ominous signal for the trade-focused economy. And on Tuesday, logistics and delivery firm FedEx, considered a bellwether for the world economy, slashed its 2019 forecasts, noting ""ongoing deceleration"" in global growth. European shares rose 0.3 percent and MSCI's global equity index firmed a touch, though it has fallen 6 percent since the start of this month, given the fragile nature of the Sino-U.S. tariff truce and signs that company earnings worldwide are slowing. While equity futures signal a stronger opening on Wall Street, U.S. stocks are set for their worst December since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression. https://tmsnrt.rs/2A3z5ML ""It's a confluence of several important factors: the market is adjusting its outlook on growth and there is a consensus we will see a slowdown. More importantly, the market is adjusting to the idea this will translate into lower earnings growth,"" said Norman Villamin, chief investment officer for private banking at Union Bancaire Privee in Zurich. ""It's being complicated by the tightening liquidity situation with the Fed expected to move today and the ECB having signalled the end of its (stimulus)"". Futures are sticking with a two-in-three chance of a rate rise on Wednesday and Villamin expects the Fed to move twice in 2019. That's a more hawkish call than the broader market which is pricing less than one rise in 2019, down from three not long back. The expectations of a Fed pause and the equity selloff sent 10-year Treasury yields to the lowest since August at 2.799 percent - down 20 basis points in December - while two-year yields touched a three-month trough of 2.629 percent, sliding from November's 2.977 percent peak. Yields in Japan and Australia also reached multi-month lows. Reasons for the bond rally were easy to find. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's closely watched monthly survey found more than half of its participants now flagging a global economic slowdown next year. It also showed the third biggest decline in inflation expectations on record. The poll also revealed the largest ever one-month rotation into fixed-income assets, their gains coming at the expense of equities. The steep drop in Treasury yields undermined one of the U.S. dollar's major props and pulled its index back 0.3 percent to 96.8, from a recent top of 97.711. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.15 percent to 112.37 yen , while the euro nudged up to $1.1383 from a $1.1266 low. Villamin of UBP said that while uncertainty had grown about the Fed's rate rise path, other currencies from the yen to the euro still lacked interest rate support. ""Why the dollar won't be too weak is that the alternatives are not attractive,"" he said. ""The only real attractive currency out there is the dollar ... we think dollar strength will stay another 3-6 months."" U.S. futures pointed to a firmer Wall Street opening. The bright spot on world markets is Italy where bond yields continued their fall after Rome struck a deal with the EU Commission over its contentious 2019 budget, signalling an end to weeks of wrangling. The Italian/German 10-year bond yield gap - a measure of Italian risk - narrowed to around 255 bps, the tightest since late September. That spread had been over 300 bps as recently as end-November. ""Everyone was expecting an agreement to be reached, but many people were expecting this to come in Q1 or Q2 next year,"" said Commerzbank rates strategist Michael Leister. ""With risk sentiment stabilising this morning, it looks like the momentum can increase in Italian bonds.""

ADNOC, the state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, has awarded OMV a 5 percent stake in the development of its Ghasha concession, ADNOC's offshore ultra-sour gas mega project. Development will cover Hail, Ghasha, Dalma, and other natural gas fields offshore Abu Dhabi. The Vienna-based oil and gas company joins Italy's ENI and Germany's Wintershall as partners to ADNOC — ENI and Wintershall earlier this month were awarded a 25 percent share and 10 percent share of the concession, respectively. OMV's 5 percent constitutes the remainder of the 40 percent of the Ghasha concession earmarked for foreign investors. ADNOC's latest move underscores its integrated gas strategy, a plan to gradually develop its sizable gas reserves and bring the UAE to gas self-sufficiency, which it hopes will ultimately enable its transition from a net importer of natural gas to a net exporter. Abu Dhabi expects the project to produce over 1.5 billion cubic feet of gas per day when it comes on stream around the middle of the next decade — enough to provide electricity to more than 2 million homes, the ADNOC's press release said.

2018-12-19,"LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Oil stabilised on Wednesday after one of its biggest falls for years, but remained under pressure from oversupply and concern that a slowing global economy would depress demand for fuel. Benchmark Brent crude oil was up 30 cents at $56.56 a barrel by 0840 GMT, after dropping 5.6 percent on Tuesday and at one point hitting a 14-month low. U.S. light crude was 20 cents higher at $46.44, after plunging 7.3 percent in the previous session when it touched its lowest since August 2017. Both benchmarks have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of October as crude supply from the Middle East, Russia and the United States has outstripped demand, filling oil tanks. ""The market is experiencing price carnage, maximum pain and considerable downside pressure,"" said Robin Bieber, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil. ""The trend is down."" Tuesday's sell-off was encouraged by a sharp fall in world stock markets after signs that economic growth, and hence demand for energy, was slowing. There were also worries that higher U.S. interest rates could slow U.S. growth. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday. The central bank is due to announce its decision at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT). Adding to worries about oversupply, the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday that U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, while gasoline inventories increased. If the build in U.S. crude stockpiles is confirmed by U.S. government data on Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million bpd, equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russian oil output is at a record 11.42 million bpd so far this month, an industry source told Reuters. The U.S. government has said shale production should climb to over 8 million bpd for the first time by the end of December. Global oil supply faces pockets of disruption.

2018-12-19,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices clawed back some ground on Wednesday as global equity markets showed signs of stabilizing, but crude was still under pressure from worries about oversupply and a slowing global economy that had driven sharp losses in the last three sessions. West Texas Intermediate futures (WTI) had climbed 7 cents, or 0.15 percent, to $46.31 per barrel by 0722 GMT, after plunging 7.3 percent the day before in a session when it touched its lowest since August 2017. Global benchmark Brent crude futures rose 0.36 percent, or 20 cents, to $56.46 per barrel. They dropped 5.6 percent on Tuesday, at one point hitting a 14-month low. Brent is down more than 30 percent from a recent peak of $86.74 per barrel on Oct. 3, while WTI has declined nearly 40 percent from a multi-year high of $76.9 per barrel recorded on Oct. 4. ""(WTI prices are holding on Wednesday as) traders look for some solace in U.S. equity markets as risk sentiment appears to be stabilizing,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA ""But we are far removed from any bullish flip in investor sentiment."" The S&P 500 ended up slightly on Tuesday and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.35 percent as both indices ended losing streaks. Further adding to the oversupply concerns, the American Petroleum Institute on Tuesday said U.S. crude stocks rose unexpectedly last week, while gasoline inventories increased. If the build in crude stockpiles is confirmed by U.S. government data on Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. Meanwhile, analysts said that upcoming output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) had so far failed to stimulate the market as they were not due to kick in until next month. Output from de facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia as well as the United States and Russia - leading producers outside the group - has been at or near record highs. The U.S. government said shale production is expected to climb to over 8 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time by the end of December. Russian oil output is at a record 11.42 million bpd so far this month, an industry source told Reuters. However, there were some factors tightening supply, with Libya's state oil company declaring force majeure at the country's largest oilfield. That came a week after the firm announced a contractual waiver on exports from the field following its seizure by protesters. Elsewhere, a speech marking 40 years of market liberalization by Chinese President Xi Jinping offered no specific support measures for the second-largest economy, disappointing investors who were expecting fiscal policy loosening and a tax cut. China's Shanghai crude futures fell 5.8 percent to trade at 389.4 yuan ($56.53) per barrel on Wednesday, the lowest since their launch in March. Oil market investors were also turning their attention to the outcome of a two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve that is due to end on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to raise U.S. interest rates for the fourth time this year though the central bank may temper the outlook for further increases in 2019 due to concerns about the economy.
