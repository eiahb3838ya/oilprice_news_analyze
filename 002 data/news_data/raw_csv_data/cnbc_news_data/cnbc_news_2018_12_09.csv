2018-12-09,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 10 (Reuters) - The key concept in the wake of the decision to reduce crude oil output by OPEC and its allies is ""balance."" It's something everybody in the market says they want, but they all have different ideas of what it means and how to get there. Boiled down to the basics, both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the other producers, most notably Russia, are trying to do with the move to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) is achieve their vision of a balanced market. While what this means is not exactly spelled out in unambiguous terms, it's assumed to mean that they want an oil price they believe to be ""fair"" and one that will allow them to meet their fiscal obligations as well as ensuring sufficient incentive for capital spending to maintain future output. What this means for the price of crude oil is less than certain, although it's likely that OPEC and its allies will take the view that the $60.06 a barrel that Brent crude closed at the day before the Dec. 7 output deal was reached is too low. But it's also apparent that in the current climate an oil price above $80 a barrel will result in fairly rapid demand destruction and rising output from producers outside the OPEC orbit. Brent reached a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel on Oct. 3, but a mere eight weeks later it had shed almost 34 percent of its value, hitting a trough of $57.50 on Nov. 28, the lowest level in a year. It's that rapid plunge that led OPEC and its allies to conclude that the market was no longer in balance, and that output needed to be cut to return to the desired, but elusive, state. The market will now get to deliver its verdict on whether OPEC has once again baked a magic pudding that will allow crude prices to rise, but not so high that demand is threatened. The initial price action after the announcement of the deal was mildly positive for OPEC, with Brent jumping as much as $3.67 to $63.73 a barrel during trade on Dec. 7, but eventually it closed at $61.67, up 2.7 percent from the previous day. TRUMP, IRAN The nirvana of balance also means that OPEC, and in particular its largest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia, have to walk a series of political tightropes. The obvious one is also the most public, U.S. President Donald Trump, who is often criticized for changing his mind on issues, but has been remarkably consistent on one front, namely his desire for lower oil prices. It's perhaps no surprise that Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih singled out U.S. energy companies as winners from the OPEC and allies deal, telling reporters at the meeting in Vienna on Dec. 7 that they were ""breathing a sigh of relief."" This was perhaps a not-so-subtle attempt to stave off a blast from Trump on his favored social media platform Twitter, by reminding him that the powerful U.S. energy lobby is no friend of his push for ever lower oil prices. The Saudis also have to manage their relationship with the United States carefully in the wake of the murder of Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's consulate in October. Trump has said he is not convinced the Saudi crown prince ordered the murder, even as leaders of his own Republican Party make noises about imposing stiff sanctions on Saudi Arabia for the killing. A further complicating factor is Iran, which is exempt from the new output-cutting deal, and in theory living on borrowed time given the U.S. waivers on its oil exports are due to expire on April. Given the plethora of competing factors and influences, it would seem balance will be a difficult, if not impossible task in the crude oil market. But how will the success of this latest production cut be measured? If crude remains in a range between $60 and $80 a barrel in the run up to the expiry of the Iran export waivers, then it might be fair to argue that OPEC and its allies will have achieved what they wanted - a floor and a ceiling that everybody can live with.

2018-12-09,"SINGAPORE, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday, extending gains from Friday when producer club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers agreed a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January. International Brent crude oil futures were at $62.15 per barrel at 0129 GMT, up 48 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last close. Prices surged on Friday after the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers including heavyweight Russia announced they would cut oil supply by 1.2 million bpd, with an 800,000 bpd reduction planned by OPEC-members and 400,000 bpd by countries not affiliated with the group. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.66 per barrel, up 4 cents, held back more than Brent as the booming U.S. oil industry is not taking part in the announced cuts. The OPEC-led supply curbs will be made from January, measured against October 2018 output levels. ""Our key conclusion is that oil prices will be well supported around the $70 per barrel level for 2019,"" analysts at Bernstein Energy said on Monday. Despite the cuts, that was still a price forecast reduction of $6 per barrel as Bernstein reduced its crude oil demand forecast from 1.5 million bpd previously to 1.3 million bpd for 2019. Oil prices have been pulled down sharply since October by signs of an economic slowdown, with Brent losing almost 30 percent in value. Japan, the world's third biggest economy and No.4 oil consumer, on Monday revised its third quarter GDP growth down to an annualised rate of -2.5 percent, down from the initial estimate of -1.2 percent. Meanwhile the two world's biggest economies, the United States and China, are locked in a trade war which is threatening to slow global growth and battering investor sentiment. Despite the expectations of a slowdown, physical demand on the ground remains healthy. China, the world's biggest oil importer, over the weekend reported an annualised 8.5 percent jump in November crude imports, to 10.43 million bpd, marking the first time China imported more than 10 million bpd. That leaves the world's second-biggest economy on track to set yet another annual import record. Strong demand is being driven in part by new refineries, triggering excess supply of fuels, filling up storage tanks and eroding refinery profits across Asia.
