2018-12-16,"SINGAPORE, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices were largely steady on Monday after falling 2 percent in the previous session, but remained under pressure amid weaker growth in major economies and concerns about oversupply. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.33 per barrel at 0423 GMT, up 5 cents, or 0.08 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.33 per barrel, up 13 cents, or 0.25 percent.

Chinese oil refinery throughput in November fell from October, suggesting an easing in oil demand, while the country's industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as the economy continued to lose momentum.
