2018-12-20,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed on Friday after tumbling 5 percent in the last session, with OPEC production cuts that start next month seen being deeper then previously expected. Benchmark Brent crude futures were up 1.51 percent at $55.17 per barrel at 0112 GMT, recovering from losses of $2.89 per barrel the session before. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 1.53 percent, or 70 cents, to $46.58 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plans to release a table detailing output cut quotas for its members and allies such as Russia in an effort to shore up the price of crude, OPEC's secretary-general said in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday. Mohammad Barkindo said to reach the proposed cut of 1.2 million barrels per day, the effective reduction for member countries was 3.02 percent. That is higher than the initially discussed 2.5 percent as OPEC seeks to accommodate Iran, Libya and Venezuela, which are exempt from any requirement to cut. ""The current oil prices will force OPEC to increase compliance with the production cut deals, supporting Brent prices,"" said Wang Xiao, head of crude research at Guotai Junan futures. ""The temporary recovery in prices has been driven by short- sellers buying back."" ANZ Research said in note that investors had been trading on macroeconomic factors and technical analysis rather than market fundamentals, keeping prices under pressure. U.S. crude prices broke through a support level at $45.94 per barrel during the last session and rebounded after sinking to $45.67, their lowest since late August 2017.

2018-12-20,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday to erase most of their gains from the day before, resuming declines seen earlier in the week amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy. The front-month U.S. crude contract had dropped $1, or 2.08 percent, to $47.17 per barrel by 0742 GMT, offseting gains of 96 cents chalked up on Wednesday. International benchmark Brent crude futures were down $1, or 1.75 percent, at $56.24 per barrel, after climbing almost 2 percent the session before. ""Wednesday's recovery was short-covering.

Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said he expected global oil stocks to fall by the end of the first quarter, but added that the market remained vulnerable to political and economic factors as well as speculation. Technical analysis showed U.S. oil may retest support at $45.94 per barrel, a break below which could cause a loss to $44.43, Reuters market analyst Wang Tao wrote on Thursday. SQUARING UP Volatility in crude prices this week has driven investors to close their positions and is draining liquidity from the market, Xi said. Total market open interest in U.S. crude contracts had fallen to 2.063 million contracts as of Thursday, up from a record of 2.71 million in May. ""It has been a tumultuous week in oil markets and traders may opt to shut it down after the last big risk event of the year with year-end position-squaring likely to kick-in today,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA. Innes was referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting of 2018, at which it suggested the U.S. economy no longer needed the central bank's support either through lower-than-normal interest rates or by maintaining a massive balance sheet. But U.S. inventory data offered some support to WTI prices. U.S. crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected.

2018-12-20,"Oil prices plunged to their lowest levels in over a year on Thursday, deepening a sell-off fueled by concerns about oversupply as stock markets slumped on rising U.S. interest rates. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ended Thursday's session down $2.29, or 4.8 percent, at $45.88, the lowest closing price since July 2017. WTI is now down about 24 percent this year. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell $2.89, or about 5 percent, to $54.35, its weakest settle since mid-September 2017. Brent has shed nearly 19 percent in 2019. Crude futures staged a rally in the previous session on signs of strong fuel demand in the United States. However, bearish reports out of Asia overnight added to worries on both the supply and demand sides of the oil market ledger.

In India, crude oil imports in November registered their biggest year-over-year decline in almost four years, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Asian oil buyers reported robust purchases of Saudi crude in January after the kingdom cut prices into the region, according to S&P Global Platts. Oil recouped some of the losses through the morning, but dropped sharply around noon, mirroring a pullback in the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 450 points as equities were buffeted by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. Crude futures have now fallen more than 35 percent from their 52-week highs in early October. The market is grappling with surging supply from the world's top three producers — the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia — at a time when demand for oil is expected to grow less than previously expected. To prevent a price-crushing glut, OPEC and 10 other producers including Russia agreed earlier this month to remove 1.2 million barrels per day from the market. But the production cuts do not take effect until January, and the announcement has so far done little to stop the collapse in crude prices. OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo is now calling on the allied producers to publicly release their production levels, Reuters reported on Thursday. The producers did not disclose that detail during a press conference earlier this month, leaving the market to question how much oil production each country would cut.

OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said to reach the proposed cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), the effective reduction for member countries would need to be 3.02 percent. That is higher than the initially discussed 2.5 percent discussed earlier this month. ""In the interests of openness and transparency, and to support market sentiment and confidence, it is vital to make these production adjustments publicly available,"" Barkindo reportedly told OPEC members in the letter. ""I would urge Your Excellencies to kindly make positive announcements reinstating your countries' commitment to implementing the agreed decisions. This is also vital to underpin trust in our decisions and to buttress ourselves from any naysayers who may doubt our commitment.""

2018-12-20,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday to erase most of their gains from the day before, resuming declines seen earlier in the week amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy. The front-month U.S. crude contract had dropped $1, or 2.08 percent, to $47.17 per barrel by 0742 GMT, offseting gains of 96 cents chalked up on Wednesday. International benchmark Brent crude futures were down $1, or 1.75 percent, at $56.24 per barrel, after climbing almost 2 percent the session before. ""Wednesday's recovery was short-covering. Investors quickly moved their attention to deteriorating fundamentals in the oil markets including more signs of slowing economic growth next year, record production and the lack of confidence with OPEC's pledge to curb production,"" said Xi Jiarui, chief oil analyst at consultancy JLC. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. Oil prices are down more than 30 percent from peaks seen in October. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said he expected global oil stocks to fall by the end of the first quarter, but added that the market remained vulnerable to political and economic factors as well as speculation. Technical analysis showed U.S. oil may retest support at $45.94 per barrel, a break below which could cause a loss to $44.43, Reuters market analyst Wang Tao wrote on Thursday. SQUARING UP Volatility in crude prices this week has driven investors to close their positions and is draining liquidity from the market, Xi said. Total market open interest in U.S. crude contracts had fallen to 2.063 million contracts as of Thursday, up from a record of 2.71 million in May. ""It has been a tumultuous week in oil markets and traders may opt to shut it down after the last big risk event of the year with year-end position-squaring likely to kick-in today,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA. Innes was referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting of 2018, at which it suggested the U.S. economy no longer needed the central bank's support either through lower-than-normal interest rates or by maintaining a massive balance sheet. But U.S. inventory data offered some support to WTI prices. U.S. crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected. The decline was the third consecutive fall. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, dropped by 4.2 million barrels, the EIA said, versus expectations of a 573,000-barrel increase. Distillate demand rose to the highest since January 2003, which bolstered buying, particularly in heating oil futures, the market's proxy for diesel.

2018-12-20,"Oil prices plunged to their lowest levels in over a year on Thursday, deepening a sell-off fueled by concerns about oversupply as stock markets slumped on rising U.S. interest rates. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude ended Thursday's session down $2.29, or 4.8 percent, at $45.88, the lowest closing price since July 2017. WTI is now down about 24 percent this year. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell $2.89, or about 5 percent, to $54.35, its weakest settle since mid-September 2017. Brent has shed nearly 19 percent in 2019. Crude futures staged a rally in the previous session on signs of strong fuel demand in the United States. However, bearish reports out of Asia overnight added to worries on both the supply and demand sides of the oil market ledger. ""There's just a really negative narrative out there,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital. ""The stars are just aligned right now in a bearish way.""  In India, crude oil imports in November registered their biggest year-over-year decline in almost four years, Reuters reported. Meanwhile, Asian oil buyers reported robust purchases of Saudi crude in January after the kingdom cut prices into the region, according to S&P Global Platts. Oil recouped some of the losses through the morning, but dropped sharply around noon, mirroring a pullback in the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 450 points as equities were buffeted by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. Crude futures have now fallen more than 35 percent from their 52-week highs in early October. The market is grappling with surging supply from the world's top three producers — the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia — at a time when demand for oil is expected to grow less than previously expected. To prevent a price-crushing glut, OPEC and 10 other producers including Russia agreed earlier this month to remove 1.2 million barrels per day from the market. But the production cuts do not take effect until January, and the announcement has so far done little to stop the collapse in crude prices. OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo is now calling on the allied producers to publicly release their production levels, Reuters reported on Thursday. The producers did not disclose that detail during a press conference earlier this month, leaving the market to question how much oil production each country would cut.
