2018-12-11,"SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices climbed on Wednesday, supported by expectations that an OPEC-led supply cut announced last week for 2019 would stabilize markets. Disruptions to Libyan oil exports after local militia seized the country's biggest oilfield, El Sharara, were also buoying prices, traders said. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.15 per barrel at 0023 GMT, up 1 percent from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Analysts said a decision by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers including Russia to cut supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) would likely stabilize prices, although several said they did not expect the agreement to push markets much higher. ""OPEC production curbs will stabilize the market,"" ANZ bank said on Wednesday. Crude prices had lost a third of their value between early October and the announcement of the cuts. Fereidun Fesharaki of energy consultancy FGE said in a note that the OPEC-led cuts would likely be ""insufficient to mop up the inventories in the targeted three-month period till the end of the first quarter of 2019."" As a result, FGE said prices were ""likely to hover in the $55-60 per barrel range for Brent, with WTI sitting some $5-10 per barrel below this given current fundamentals."" Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com, said ""additional doubts were raised after the decision to reduce output was made on Friday, when ... OPEC refused to specify which country would cut how much."" Undermining the supply cuts is soaring output in the United States, where crude production <C-OUT-T-EIA> has hit a record 11.7 million bpd. The United States is set to end 2018 as the world's top oil producer, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) saying on Tuesday that the nation's annualized average output would be 10.88 million bpd over the year. The 2018 output increase would be 1.53 million bpd, the EIA said, adding that it expected production to average an unprecedented 12.06 million bpd in 2019. ""U.S. oil production growth continues relentlessly and will probably continue for the foreseeable future to offset any supply-side adjustments from the OPEC+ group,"" Razaqzada said.

2018-12-11,"NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Oil futures edged higher on Tuesday after paring most of their gains as stock markets turned negative on worries about a possible U.S. government shutdown. U.S. stock markets pulled back after President Donald Trump threatened to shut down the federal government over funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. ""It looks like the prospect of a U.S. government shutdown is not good for any asset class. Equities reacted first, taking oil prices down with it,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. Prices rose over $1 a barrel earlier in the session after Libya's National Oil Company (NOC) declared a force majeure on exports from the country's biggest oilfield, which was seized last weekend by a militia group. NOC said on Monday that the shutdown of the El Sharara oilfield would result in a production loss of 315,000 barrels per day (bpd), and an additional loss of 73,000 bpd at the El Feel oilfield. After the strong start, Brent futures ended just 23 cents, or 0.4 percent, higher at $60.20 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 65 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $51.65. Also adding pressure to the market, was Russia's slower-than-expected planned cuts in production as part of an OPEC-led deal agreed last week to curb output by a joint 1.2 million bpd from January to shore up prices. Russia said on Tuesday it planned to cut oil output by just 50,000 to 60,000 bpd in January, as it gradually builds to an agreed cut of 220,000 bpd. ""Crude futures are roughly unchanged from just prior to the OPEC agreement as the market is apparently expressing concerns over an indicated slow start to Russia's output reductions next month,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Chicago, said in a report. Other analysts noted the reduction by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, like Russia, may not be deep enough to restore balance to the market especially after the U.S. government confirmed its forecast that the United States would end this year as the new top producing nation. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast U.S. output would rise to a record 10.9 million bpd in 2018 and 12.1 million bpd in 2019.

2018-12-11,"President Donald Trump has told foreign leaders that ""America First"" means he will always put the needs of America ahead of the needs of other nations â€” and that they should do the same for their own country. Saudi Arabia's leadership appears to be on board with that message. Last week, Saudi Arabia disregarded Trump's public pressure campaign to keep pumping at full throttle and cut fuel costs. The kingdom instead persuaded two dozen oil producers to cut output and announced a steep drop in Saudi production over the next two months. ""Saudi Arabia today had a 'Saudi first' policy,"" Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said on Friday.

A year ahead outlook report from Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects Brent crude to regain its recent losses in 2019 and settle at $70 a barrel.

""Volatility will be high in the near future, but going into 2019, we are constructive on oil prices,"" Hootan Yazhari, head of global frontier markets equity research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Tuesday.
