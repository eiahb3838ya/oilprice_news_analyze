2018-12-24,"The continuing collapse in oil prices signals that investors are worried about a 2019 recession, according to Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Oil prices have now plunged by about 40 percent from their 52-week highs at the start of October. Last week alone, U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude tumbled 11 percent, posting its worst weekly performance in nearly three years.  On Monday, WTI fell below $45 a barrel for the first time since July 2017. ""I think what we're seeing in oil is a big, big concern for 2019 about a recession. I think that is really weighing heavily on this market,"" Croft told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Friday.  Croft's commentary reflects an emerging view on Wall Street that slowing economic growth and weaker-than-anticipated demand are pushing the oil market deeper into bear market territory.  The rout has continued despite a pledge earlier this month by OPEC, Russia and several other oil producers to remove 1.2 million barrels per day from the market beginning in January. Surging oil production from the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia is one factor behind the selling. But Croft says the depth of the pullback indicates that expectations for slower economic growth and darkening demand forecasts are what's truly driving the rout. ""I think it's a broad-based fear about where is demand going to be for oil next year, concerns about Chinese demand in particular,"" Croft said. To be sure, Croft is not necessarily forecasting a recession, and there are few clear signs that a period of economic contraction is on the horizon. Still, surveys indicate that executives are growing more worried about the prospect. Nearly half of chief financial officers see a chance that a recession will hit by the end of 2019, according to a CNBC survey. Meanwhile, U.S.-Chinese trade tensions are causing finance executives to lose faith in China's economic growth, a Deloitte survey shows. Croft is not the only analyst now focusing on the demand side of the oil market ledger.

2018-12-24,"LONDON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Monday after evidence that a recent fall to 15-month lows may be affecting output in the United States, the world's largest producer, although concern about the outlook for demand tempered gains. Brent crude futures were up 8 cents at $53.90 a barrel by 1123 GMT, while U.S. crude futures eased by 5 cents to $45.54. Brent fell 11 percent last week and hit its lowest since September 2017, while U.S. futures slid to their lowest since July 2017, bringing the decline in the two contracts to 35 percent so far this quarter. The price drop has caused U.S. shale oil producers to curtail drilling plans for next year. The boom in shale output has made the United States the world's largest oil producer, overtaking Saudi Arabia and Russia. Physical prices for Brent have also fallen in the last six weeks, driven by a drop in demand from Chinese refiners in particular, which has weighed on the value of barrels of anything from North Sea to Nigerian crude. ""The recent weakness in the physical Brent structure can be attributed to a broader easing of purchases by Asian refiners at this point, with lower end-Q1 intake weighing on spot assessments, and we can expect this pressure to carry through over the coming weeks,"" consultancy JBC Energy said in a report. Still, the macroeconomic picture and its impact on oil demand continue to pressure prices. Global equities have fallen nearly 9.5 percent so far in December, their biggest one-month slide since September 2011, when the euro zone debt crisis was unfolding. The trade dispute between the United States and China and the prospect of a rapid rise in U.S. interest rates have brought global stocks down from this year's record highs and ignited concern that oil demand will be insufficient to soak up any excess supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia agreed this month to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day from January. Should that fail to balance the market, OPEC and its allies will hold an extraordinary meeting, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said on Sunday. ""Oil ministers are already taking to the airwaves with a 'price stability at all cost' mantra,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.

2018-12-24,"An oversupply of oil will continue to pressure prices into the first quarter of 2019, but producer cuts will eventually boost crude price as the year progresses, according to Argus Media, an energy information provider. That is, supply and demand should rebalance by the second quarter of next year, said Azlin Ahmad, editor for crude oil at Argus. Since climbing to four-year highs in early October, the price of crude futures have crashed by more than a third. The latest wave of heavy selling comes at a time when the energy market as well as the global economy is gripped by a flurry of bearish factors. Brent oil futures, the international benchmark were trading around $53.60 per barrel on Monday, representing an almost 20 percent decline in 2018.

2018-12-24,"U.S. crude plunged nearly 7 percent on Monday, hitting its lowest levels in a year and half, as the oil market fell in tandem with equities amid deepening turmoil in Washington DC. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted more than 600 points, while the S&P 500 closed in bear market territory. Both stock indexes were buffeted by headlines out of Washington, including a government shutdown and President Donald Trump's reported desire to fire Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell over the central bank's interest rate increases. The selling in global risk assets on Christmas Eve deepened a nearly three-month slide in oil prices. From peak to trough, U.S. crude has fallen nearly 45 percent from its 52-week high at the start of October. Brent has fallen as much as 42 percent over the same period. ""For now, there's no place to hide in any of these markets. Oil's being taken down with the stock market and the negative sentiment that's sweeping across really everything, and for now the downward pressure is going to persist,"" John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Friday.  U.S. crude futures ended Monday's session down $3.06, or 6.7 percent, at $42.53, the lowest closing price since June 21, 2017. At the session low, WTI came within about 30 cents of U.S. crude's 2017 low at $42.05. Brent crude futures fell 6.2 percent, or $3.35, to $50.47 a barrel, hitting a 16-month low. Brent fell 11 percent last week, while U.S. crude posted its worst weekly performance in nearly three years. The fourth-quarter rout in oil markets is being fueled by concerns about growing oversupply in the market. Top producers the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia have pumped at record levels in recent months. Meanwhile, forecasters now say demand for oil will grow more slowly than previously anticipated in 2019. Financial strain in emerging markets, rising interest rates and trade tensions are fueling fears of a slowdown in global economic growth, which would weigh on fuel consumption.
