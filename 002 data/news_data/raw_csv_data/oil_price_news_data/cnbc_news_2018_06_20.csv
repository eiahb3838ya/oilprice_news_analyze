2018-06-20,"Back in 2011, when OPEC met to discuss raising oil production to offset the drop in Libya, resulting from the civil war, Saudi Arabia’s Ali al-Naimi called it “one of the worst meetings ever.” That meeting ended without consensus and this is likely to happen again this week, when the cartel meets to discuss another production increase.The fault line is between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which have both signaled that they are all for a substantial increase in production, of up to 1.5 million bpd, and Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Algeria (to date), which would have a problem raising their production.The latest remarks from Iran’s Oil Minister are not really encouraging. Bijan Zanganeh said, as quoted by Reuters, that “I don’t believe at this meeting we can reach agreement. OPEC is not the organization to receive instruction from President Trump ... OPEC is not part of the Department of Energy of the United States.”The comment refers to President Trump’s tweets about OPEC artificially pushing prices higher and reports that he personally asked Saudi Arabia’s government to step in and replace soon-to-be-lost Iranian barrels with its own after sanctions kick in.Zanganeh also said he will be leaving Vienna before OPEC’s meeting with Russia and the other non-member partners in the cut deal. Russia is Iran’s geopolitical ally, but now they are in opposing camps with regard to oil production moves and missing that particular meeting could be a diplomatic move to avoid confrontation.Russia is the country pushing for the highest increase, of 1.5 million bpd. Energy Minister Alexander Novak said “Oil demand usually grows at the steepest pace in the third quarter ... We could face a deficit if we don’t take measures,” echoing widely shared analyst expectations of booming oil demand that they have argued was instrumental in the oil price improvement over the last year or so.Instrumental as it has been, it is not as robust and unyielding as previously believed. When prices climbed closer to US$80 a barrel, demand growth began to slow down, which for some reason surprised many oil bulls.  Related: Goldman: Expect Another Bull Run In OilThis slowdown in demand growth highlighted the fact that the emerging economies that are the biggest drivers behind global oil demand growth are not ready to pay whatever asking price they are offered. They are rather going to bargain for lower prices, which is exactly what India and China did, prompting OPEC to consider an early end to the cuts.As for the internal fractures within OPEC, it’s also worth noting that two of Saudi Arabia’s Gulf allies—Kuwait and Oman—are also not on board with a quick, major production boost. They seem to be leaning more towards a gradual, and more modest, increase, Reuters reports citing OPEC sources. Indeed, some believe Russia’s 1.5-million-bpd proposal is a tactical move aimed at priming the dissenters for agreement to a more modest increase.Whether or not this move succeeds—the chance seems to be fifty-fifty right now—OPEC might soon have a bigger problem to deal with. The U.S. Congress is deliberating the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, which—if passed—would allow lawsuits against OPEC members for manipulating the market.

2018-06-20,"Iran has suggested it could be open to a compromise on a small rise in OPEC oil output after earlier rejecting a plan by Russia and Saudi Arabia to increase production in response to consumer concerns over rising prices.Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on June 20 said cartel members that had cut more than required in recent months could increase output back to higher agreed quotas.Experts said that would effectively mean a slight increase from top producers such as Saudi Arabia, which has been cutting more deeply than required under previous policies designed to raise once-slumping prices.A day earlier, Zanganeh had told reporters upon arrival at Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) headquarters in Vienna that ""I don't believe at this meeting we can reach agreement.""Moscow and Riyadh have proposed reversing most of a 1.8 million-barrels-a-day cut in production that OPEC and other major producers agreed to in 2016 amid recent calls by the United States, China, and other major oil-consuming countries for relief from rising pump prices.But Iran has signaled its opposition along with Iraq, Algeria, and Venezuela, three other influential OPEC members. Zanganeh cited recent demands for a production increase from U.S. President Donald Trump as a reason to oppose it.Trump has ""created difficulty for the oil market"" by imposing sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, Zanganeh asserted, leading to lower production and higher prices.

OPEC is an independent organization, not an organization to receive instruction from President Trump.... OPEC is not part of the Department of Energy of the United States,"" he said.Premium crude prices have surged nearly 75 percent to almost $80 a barrel since OPEC and allies such as Russia, Kazakhstan, and Mexico agreed to a production cut in late 2016.OPEC is due to meet on June 22 to review the agreement and plans to meet the next day with Russia and other non-OPEC producers that joined the agreement in 2016.Zanganeh had said he would leave Vienna before talks with Russia and other non-OPEC countries were held, but participants said on June 20 that efforts were taking place to persuade Iran to participate in any deal.OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on June 20 he was confident there would be a deal during the June 22 discussions.Iraq's oil chief, Jabar al-Luaibi, said he hoped there would be agreement when OPEC met, but added that the ""oil market has not reached the level of stabilization.""Iran's opposition to raising oil output puts it on a collision course with Russia, which has called for raising production by 1.5 million barrels a day, in a near-total rollback of the 2016 production cuts.Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said the need for increased output is urgent during the summer, when demand for gasoline and oil hits a high point for the year.

""In our view, this could lead to market overheating"" -- meaning sharply higher prices.Novak said that if OPEC and its allies decide this week to raise output, they could review their decision and fine-tune it at another planned meeting in September.Saudi Arabia, a close ally of the United States, is particularly under pressure from Trump to offset any production decline caused by the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran in November.Russia and others have also warned that continuing to limit supply could encourage increased production from shale oil producers in the United States, who are not part of the OPEC agreement and pose outside competition.By RFE/RLMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Hints-At-Compromise-To-Raise-Oil-Output.html,"Jun 20, 2018 at 15:14 | RFE/RL staff","Jun 20, 2018",Iran Hints At Compromise To Raise Oil Output
2018-06-20,"Although OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies have not yet decided if and how much oil they will restore to the market, Russia’s plans for exports and refinery runs in the coming months point to Moscow preparing to increase its oil production, as early as in July.Russia’s July-September crude oil exports and transit schedules and refinery run plans for the third quarter suggest that an increase in Russian oil production could start as early as in July, Reuters reports.According to export schedules and oil transit plans, Russia’s crude oil exports and transit are set to rise to 63.34 million tons in the third quarter this year, from 62.45 million tons expected for the second quarter. This increase translates into a 20,000 bpd boost in exports, according to Reuters calculations—not a significant number in itself, especially compared to Russia’s 11 million bpd production, but it would add to plans to boost Q3 refinery runs by 2.2 million tons, according to energy ministry forecasts.Russia is proposing a production boost in the third quarter by 1.5 million bpd, and then the partners in the OPEC+ deal will see how the oil market fares at the end of Q3, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in Saudi Arabia on Saturday after a meeting with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih.Russia’s oil companies are eager to turn the taps on and benefit from newly developed fields, and some of the biggest oil companies are said to have started to increase, little by little, their production.  Related: U.S. Overtakes Saudi Arabia In Recoverable Oil ReservesRussia is said to have pumped 11.09 million bpd in the first week of June—143,000 bpd above its quota under the production cut deal, and only about 100,000 bpd below the record-breaking production rate in November 2016.Data from the Energy Ministry shows that Russia had been exceeding its quota for three months in a row as of end-May, at 10.97 million bpd. At the beginning of June, the most marked increase came from Rosneft.Russia’s biggest producer Rosneft increased its crude oil production by 70,000 bpd in two days at the end of May. Rosneft has spare production capacity of 120,000-150,000 bpd. Gazprom Neft also said earlier this month that it was ready to start ramping up, recovering production to pre-deal levels within a month or two by adding 5,000 bpd.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Russia-Gears-Up-To-Boost-Oil-Production-In-July.html,"Jun 20, 2018 at 11:46 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jun 20, 2018",Russia Gears Up To Boost Oil Production In July
2018-06-20,"For the first time in eight weeks, hedge funds and other money managers boosted last week their net long position in Brent Crude, increasing their bets that Brent oil prices will rise and reducing wagers on lower prices.The first reverse in the net long position in Brent in two months, however, is more a sign that portfolio managers may have completed the profit-taking from the past few weeks and may have felt that they had oversold crude oil, rather than a firm wager that oil prices will rise just ahead of the much-talked-about OPEC meeting later this week, according to analysts.According to data by ICE Futures Europe compiled by Bloomberg, hedge funds boosted their net long position in Brent by 4.1 percent for the week ended on June 12—the most recent weekly data from the exchange. Data for this week’s wagers will be available after the OPEC meeting, so it won’t be until next week that we see how portfolio managers traded this week’s OPEC chatter, comments, and official statements.  For the week through June 12, hedge fund managers boosted long positions in Brent by 2.9 percent and trimmed short positions by 4 percent.“Clearly, the increase in Brent positions didn’t come at the right time,” Kyle Cooper, a consultant at ION Energy, told Bloomberg. “People saw the big drop in prices and thought, wait a second, we’re oversold now and due for a bounce. If Saudi Arabia and OPEC don’t just open up their spigots, the market still looks kind of tight.”  Related: Permian Discount Could Rise To $20 Per BarrelHedge funds flipped bets on Brent, and left wagers on WTI Crude almost unchanged week on week through June 12, but cut their net long position in other petroleum contracts such as gasoline, U.S. heating oil, and European gasoil, according to regulatory and exchange data compiled by Reuters market analyst John Kemp. In the week to June 12, money managers raised their combined Brent Crude and WTI Crude net long position by 16 million barrels, following seven weeks of reductions that had trimmed the net long position in crude oil by a total of 302 million barrels.Despite the cut in the net long position over the past two months, portfolio managers are still very bullish on crude oil as a whole—longs outnumber shorts by a ratio of almost 6.5:1. But the bets on crude oil are now less lopsided than they were in the middle of April, when the long to short positions ratio was 14:1, higher than when it was when hedge funds held a record net long position in oil back in January.Following the recent profit-taking and sell-off in Brent and WTI, this week’s attention is all focused on the OPEC meeting in Vienna at which the cartel and its Russia-led allies will discuss boosting production in response to supply disruptions from Venezuela and potential losses from Iran.  Related: The Fed Is Driving Down Oil PricesSaudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said last week that a deal to gradually ease the cuts was “inevitable”, but the countries set for declines in oil supply and subject to U.S. sanctions—Iran and Venezuela—vow to veto—along with support from Iraq—any Saudi proposal to lift production.This is setting the stage for a tense meeting, and the oil market and participants are guesstimating a wide range of outcomes and possible production increases—from a disastrous meeting with no unanimous decision to a production boost ranging from just 300,000 bpd to as much as 1.5 million bpd.The hedge funds’ most recent positioning in Brent and WTI may be the result of easing of the heavy profit-taking in the previous weeks, but their moves from here on out are likely to be more influenced by what OPEC does next.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Hedge-Funds-Turn-Bullish-On-Brent-Crude-Ahead-Of-OPEC-Meeting.html,"Jun 20, 2018 at 09:43 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jun 20, 2018",Hedge Funds Turn Bullish On Brent Crude Ahead Of OPEC Meeting
2018-06-20,"Crude oil prices remained relatively stable after the Energy Information Administration reported a draw of 5.9 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week to June 15.At the time of writing, Brent crude traded at US$75.60 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate changing hands at US$65.77 a barrel, both up moderately from yesterday’s close.A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute estimated crude oil inventories to have fallen by 3.016 million barrels, with gasoline inventories surprisingly going up by 2.113 million barrels.Analysts had expected the EIA to report a 690,000-bpd increase in crude oil inventories, after last week it reported a draw of as much as 4.1 million barrels in oil inventories and another substantial decline—of 2.3 million barrels—in gasoline stockpiles.Last week, gasoline inventories went up by 3.3 million barrels, with average daily production standing at 10.1 million barrels. This compares with 10.5 million barrels a week earlier.Distillate inventories were also up, by 2.7 million barrels, with average daily production at 5.5 million barrels, up from 5.1 million barrels in the prior week.  Related: Goldman: Expect Another Bull Run In OilEIA’s report comes amid anticipation that OPEC’s meeting that begins tomorrow will fail to yield a decision to start raising oil production to offset a major decline in Venezuela and an expected decline in Iran after U.S. sanctions go into effect.Some analysts are comparing this week’s meeting to one from 2011 when OPEC tried to reach a consensus to raise production to offset falling supply from war-torn Libya. That meeting failed to produce a consensus agreement—needed for all OPEC decisions—and some say this one will have the same fate.It’s anyone’s guess what individual OPEC members will decide to do if the meeting ends without an agreement, but in all likelihood those that can produce more will do so, if only to keep their market share in the face of rising U.S. and other non-OPEC supply.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Inches-Higher-On-Strong-Crude-Draw.html,"Jun 20, 2018 at 09:43 | Irina Slav","Jun 20, 2018",Oil Inches Higher On Strong Crude Draw
