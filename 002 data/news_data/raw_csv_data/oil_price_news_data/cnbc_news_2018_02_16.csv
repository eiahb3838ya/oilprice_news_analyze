2018-02-16,"The interaction between U.S. shale and OPEC will continue to be the dominant narrative in the oil market this year, and the opposing forces could end up trapping oil prices within a relatively narrow price band.Market sentiment has shifted quite a bit over the past month, with the impact of the OPEC cuts sparking bullish sentiment and huge price gains in January. But the surge in U.S. shale production has decidedly broken the fever, and oil prices have retreated sharply from their highs amid fears of another downturn.This dynamic could continue for quite a while, with prices and sentiment seesawing back and forth. Nevertheless, while OPEC and shale drillers duke it out, those too opposing forces could put lower and upper bounds on oil prices, keeping trading within a relatively tight trading range of $60 to $75 per barrel for Brent, according to a new report from the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.If prices creep up towards the upper end of that range, U.S. shale will accelerate, adding new supply onto the market and pulling oil prices back down. There is little room below $60 per barrel, however, as the OPEC cuts continue to keep supply off the market. Moreover, oil demand remains strong, and will continue to soak up a good chunk of the additional barrels coming onto the market. Taken together, prices will likely trade between a $60 and $70 range, with OIES forecasting an average Brent price of about $67 per barrel this year.(Click to enlarge)Source: The Oxford Institute for Energy StudiesThe argument is a variation of the “shale band” theory popularized a few years ago during the depths of the oil market downturn. According to that theory, which put more responsibility on U.S. shale specifically, prices seemed to trade between $40 and $60 for quite an extended period of time, with the unique tendencies of shale drilling throwing up resistance on those upper and lower bounds. If prices dropped to $40 per barrel and below, shale drillers went out of business and supply was curtailed, pushing prices back up. If prices flirted with $60 per barrel, a new wave of shale drilling suddenly appeared and dragged crude benchmarks back down.Related: Tesla’s Powerpack: Real Hope Or Mostly Hype?That dynamic is more or less alive and well, except that OPEC has decided to raise the price floor a bit by taking 1.8 million barrels per day off of the market, a deal that has been in place for over a year. Now, the floor for Brent is more solidly at the $60 price level, rather than $40-$50 or so.Of course, this is just a forecast, and is subject to uncertainty on many levels, some of which could force oil prices to shoot above or below the $60-$75 range. On the downside, OPEC’s exit from its production cuts could end up being more chaotic than the market currently calculates. There are a few ways this could go. First, higher production levels from Nigeria, Libya or Iraq are possible. Once output rises and compliance falls, there is less pressure on the whole group to maintain compliance. Or, the market tightens to such a degree that there is a bit of disagreement about what to do at the June meeting. A messy exit from the agreement could lead to higher-than-expected output and lower prices.  For now, it does not seem likely that OPEC will emerge as a black swan to the oil market this year. All signs – strong compliance and very clear statements of support for maintaining the cuts – point to strong cohesion at this point.Another downside threat is U.S. shale. As widely noted, U.S. output is expected to exceed 11 mb/d this year, a year sooner than previously thought. The wave of output is expected to lead to another buildup in inventories, which keep oil prices at the lower end, especially if demand disappoints.Which brings up another threat to prices. Demand is strong right now – the IEA puts demand growth at 1.4 mb/d, OPEC says 1.6 mb/d – which will prevent U.S. shale from crashing prices. But if demand disappoints, there is much more room for prices to fall.Related: Oil Rig Count Rises As Prices RecoverThe flip side is that unexpected supply disruptions could blow up the price band scenario, with a steeper-than-expected decline from Venezuela, in particular, a notable possibility. The loss of 0.5 mb/d from Venezuela would add something like $3 per barrel to the oil price averaged out for the year, OIES says. A low-probability but high-impact event of over 1 mb/d of output losses would push Brent over $70 for the year.Then, of course, is the uncertainty over U.S. shale. Shale output is a downside risk to prices, but because the market is now pricing in huge production gains, the opposite effect could also play out. If U.S. shale undershoots in terms of output, that will likely translate into a bullish effect on oil.But, all of those factors, individually, are mere speculation. Taken all together, OIES says that U.S. shale and OPEC could trap crude between $60 and $75 this year.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-And-Shale-Keep-Oil-Prices-Between-60-75.html,"Feb 16, 2018 at 17:16 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 16, 2018",OPEC And Shale Keep Oil Prices Between $60-$75
2018-02-16,"Following three painful years of portfolio repositioning, cost cuts, and deferred projects, the offshore oil and gas industry is now more prepared to deliver projects and profits at lower costs and simpler designs.   Currently, U.S. shale is taking center stage in analyses about oil growth stories, and rightfully so — it’s growing at a much faster pace than previously expected. But cost inflation and investor pressure to prefer profits over production may slow down the pace of that growth going forward.Meanwhile, offshore oil — which suffered from slashed investments during the downturn — is now coming back with projects that have improved economics, in some cases challenging those of U.S. shale. That’s due to the costs that major oil companies slashed after 2014, to simpler designs, and to the supermajors reshaping portfolios and projects to make as much money at $60 Brent as they were making at $100 Brent four years ago.According to analysts at Bernstein, some 40 new offshore projects could be approved this year, a significant rise compared with 29 projects approved last year and with just 14 projects in 2016, which, according to Reuters data, was the lowest number since at least 1990. Most of the new offshore projects are also expected to be leaner and smaller and average 42,000 bpd of oil equivalents, compared to 69,000 bpd for last year’s projects, according to Bernstein.Oil majors have already announced some impressive cost reductions in offshore projects.Shell said last month that it would redevelop the Penguins oil and gas field in the UK North Sea, with a go-forward break-even price below $40 per barrel and peak production at around 45,000 bpd.Then Statoil said earlier this month that it had reduced the breakeven for the first phase of its Johan Sverdrup offshore project to below $15 per barrel.Related: Oil Rig Count Rises As Prices Recover“Their focus on simplification, design enhancements and execution efficiencies have made their offshore prospects competitive with North American shale projects,” Matthew Fitzsimmons, VP Cost Analysis at Rystad Energy, said, commenting on the Johan Sverdrup cost reduction.“Much is made of the Permian, its flexibility and the returns there. But actually infill drilling for a decade creates enormous sources of money,” Bernard Looney, head of BP’s upstream division, told Reuters.  “You will see more deepwater over time, for sure,” Looney noted.  Offshore development is needed if the industry is to offset the natural decline of currently producing oil fields, because even with the production boom, shale accounts for just 7 percent of the global oil supply of 98 million bpd, whereas offshore oil makes up more than one-quarter of supply.There are signs that optimism is returning to the upstream, and companies will continue to prefer low-cost high-value oil developments this year, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.Oil majors and national oil companies (NOCs) are expected to compete fiercely for discovered resource opportunities offshore Brazil, “bolstered by world-class deepwater economics,” WoodMac says, expecting Mexico’s licensing rounds to draw strong bidding this year as well.  Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which was badly bruised during the downturn, is also expected to stage a comeback this year, Wood Mackenzie reckons. The U.S. tax overhaul “drastically increased the fiscal competitiveness of deepwater Gulf of Mexico, relative to other offshore basins,” WoodMac said.Still, current production in the Gulf of Mexico can’t be sustained with conventional deepwater fields, William Turner, Wood Mackenzie’s senior research analyst and lead author of the “Deepwater GoM: 5 Things to Look for in 2018” insight, said.Related: Is This The Future For OPEC?“Increased investments in exploration and development, especially in ultra high-pressure high-temperature technologies and projects, are crucial not only to maintaining the current pace of production but also in unlocking the next phase of significant volumes in the region,” Turner noted.As a result of the oil price crash, global offshore investments have plunged from the 2014 highs of $335 billion, as companies had to reassess how to make higher-cost projects profitable in the lower oil price world, Rystad Energy says. The sentiment turned positive in 2017 and this year will be the bottom of the global offshore investments at $155 billion, before investments start to grow steadily year by year going forward.“This growth comes from high offshore activity, driven mainly by an increasing oil price and companies’ ability to cut costs to improve the profitability of their projects,” Emil Varre Sandøy at Rystad Energy said.By 2022, offshore investments will manage to recover to $230 billion, which will still be 25 percent lower than the 2014 high, but which will show that the industry will stick to strict cost management, Rystad says.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Offshore-Oil-Is-Poised-For-Significant-Growth.html,"Feb 16, 2018 at 17:16 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 16, 2018",Offshore Oil Is Poised For Significant Growth
2018-02-16,"The OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report is out production data for January 2018. All data, unless otherwise noted, is through January 2018 and is in thousand barrels per day.OPEC crude only production has held steady for three months. However, this chart masks the fact that November production was revised downward by 45,000 barrels per day and December production was revised downward by 107,000 barrels per day. January production was 76,000 barrels per day below last year’s 12-month average of 32,378,000 barrels per day and 247,000 barrels per day lower than OPEC’s 2016 12 month average of 32,549,000 barrels per day. OPEC oil production was down just 8,100 barrels per day in January. November production was revised down 45,000 bpd and December production was revised down by 107,000 bpd. The largest revisions were for Venezuela. Their production was revised down 28,000 bpd in November and 98,000 bpd in December. Algeria, like at least 8 other OPEC countries, is in continuous decline. Angola peaked in 2008 at a 12-month average of 1,870,000 barrels per day are currently about a quarter of a million barrels per day below that number. Ecuador’s crude oil production increased steadily for four and one-half years, from mid-2010 to January of 2015 and has been on a bumpy decline for the last three years. Equatorial Guinea’s chart speaks for itself. I really don’t know why they joined OPEC. Their production is clearly in decline but is not enough to make much difference either way. Everything I said about Equatorial Guinea can also be said about Gabon. Iran is obviously ignoring any OPEC request to cut production and are producing every possible barrel they can. Iraq’s 12-month average peaked, so far, last year, at 4,440,000 barrels per day. Their January crude oil production was 5,000 barrels per day below that average. Are they deliberately cutting production? If so, not by much. Kuwait’s chart looks strange to my eye. I believe Kuwait is one of two, and possibly three, OPEC countries that could increase production somewhat. The others are Saudi Arabia and possibly the United Arab Emirates. Libya is struggling. If peace ever breaks out in Libya they could increase production somewhat. But peace doesn’t seem to be on the horizon in Libya. Nigerian crude oil production has a general downward trend. How much of this trend is due to political problems? Some of it, no doubt. But definitely not all of it. Qatar peaked in 2008. And I won’t say “so far” here. They are clearly in decline. Saudi crude oil production has been holding steady for 13 months now. Saudi is the only OPEC nation that could increase production by any considerable amount. They could possibly increase production from one quarter to one half million barrels per day. But likely a lot closer to one quarter million per day… possibly. The UAE is one of the other two OPEC nations that just might be able to increase production somewhat. But I have more doubts about the UAE than I do about Kuwait. Venezuela is in the grasp of a full-fledged collapse. Their production has fallen 273,000 barrels per day in the last three months. Their November production was revised downward by 28,000 barrels per day and their December production was revised downward by 98,000 barrels per day.Venezuela is in danger of becoming a totally failed state, like Somalia. The worse things get, the worse things get. That is falling income from oil exports increases the chance that production will continue to fall. All income from exports will have to be used to keep the public from total rebellion and none will be left for the oil fields. Looking at a zero-based chart puts OPEC crude only production in a much clearer perspective. 2018 on this chart is January only. The point here is that so-called “OPEC cuts” are not making much of a difference. World oil production is on that proverbial bumpy plateau.(Click to enlarge) Saudi, Kuwait and the UAE began to increase production in May of 2016 and peaked in November of that year. The other 11 OPEC countries peaked in July 2017, seven months after the OPEC cuts began. They were all, at that time producing flat out. And in my opinion, still are.Although the three OPEC countries, Saudi, Kuwait and the UAE, are likely capable of increasing production, they, in my opinion, can in no way increase production to what they were producing in late 2016. That was a period where they made heroic efforts to increase production in order to establish a point from which they could “cut” production. That level was then, and is now, unsustainable. And if you remove Venezuela from the mix, then the combined production of the other 10 are at an all-time high, or nearly so. The increase in production of the countries represented in this chart, for the last two years, has been all Iran recovering from sanctions and Libya recovering from rebel attacks. Iraq has been relatively flat over the last two years and everyone else has declined. OPEC production in the above chart is crude only. It does not even include condensate. But world supply here is total liquids. So, they are comparing apples to oranges. Natural gas liquids, in the last few years, have increased far more than crude oil alone. The above chart is from the EIA and is only through October 2017. World C+C has been on a bumpy plateau since July of 2015. This is Russia thru January 2018. The data is from the Russian Minister of Energy. The data was in tons and I am using a conversion factor of 7.3 barrels per ton.By Peakoilbarrel.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Fails-To-Comply-With-OPEC-Deal.html,"Feb 16, 2018 at 17:13 | Ron Patterson","Feb 16, 2018",Iran Fails To Comply With OPEC Deal
2018-02-16,"Saudi Arabia continues to keep the market informed about its stance on the OPEC production cut deal, with Khalid al-Falih's latest guidance that Saudi would prefer to overtighten the market than exit early from cuts (channeling Neil Young's 'it's better to burn out than fade away').Al-Falih has gained a great deal of credibility over the last three-quarters of a year by outlining Saudi's next move in terms of exports, then following through on it. We should therefore take heed from his latest comments.Al-Falih also signaled that the kingdom will continue to keep its crude exports in check next month, holding below 7 million barrels per day. This is no surprise, and will be their stance until at least the Saudi Aramco IPO.We can see from our ClipperData that a good deal of OPEC's success in lowering OECD inventories has been by directing exports to emerging markets instead.We've highlighted before that Saudi Arabia took about 100 million barrels off the global market last year via lower exports. The chart below highlights the change in emphasis from Saudi Arabia around June, when it started increasingly favoring sending crude to Asia, at the expense of North America.This coincides with the strategy shift first outlined by Khalid al-Falih on May 25 last year, via his 'exports to the U.S. will drop measurably' declaration. (The start of his credit-building process).

As for deliveries to the U.S., they were conspicuous by their absence, aiding inventory draws and adding to bullish sentiment:(Click to enlarge) We have also seen another trend emerge in the last year in conjunction with the oil production cut deal: that of higher Saudi Arabian middle distillate exports. We first highlighted in March of last year that Saudi Arabia could be supplementing its lost revenues from the OPEC oil production cut deal by exporting more products.We can see from our ClipperData below that Saudi middle distillate exports outpaced year-ago levels in each of the last seven months of last year, by an average of 110,000 bpd over the period. This year has also started off strongly, well above January 2017's level.While higher refining capacity in the kingdom could explain away this increase - as could higher demand (as we discussed earlier this week) - it is interesting that the increase in middle distillate exports last June coincided with change in strategy for crude exports.
