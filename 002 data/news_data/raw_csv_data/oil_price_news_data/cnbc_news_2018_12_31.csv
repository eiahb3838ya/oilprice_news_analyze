2018-12-31,"In the decades preceding the arrival of U.S. shale oil, the oil market had only one stabilizing force, namely OPEC. The reason the oil market was structured as such was due to the nature of conventional oil production, most non-OPEC oil production prior to U.S. shale oil fell in one of two categories: major offshore projects that took 5 to 7 years to build (North Sea, Gulf of Mexico … etc.) or mature conventional onshore fields (U.S. conventional fields, Russian Siberian fields … etc.); both of these conventional oil supply sources were either non-responsive, or only slowly reactive, to changes in the oil price, major offshore oil projects tended to come online regardless of the oil price environment, while conventional onshore oil production with shallow decline rates (sub-10 percent) meant that even a slowdown in drilling would not impact total production in any meaningful way for an extended period of time.The aforementioned state of affairs meant that it was up to OPEC to adjust production to balance the market in case of abrupt supply or demand changes, OPEC had (and still has) the flexibility to withdraw millions of barrels from the market within a month or two if such a need arose (OPEC withdrawing 4m barrels from the market following the financial crisis in 2008/2009 is a case in point).The arrival of U.S. shale oil in size to the scene in 2014 has upended the OPEC/non-OPEC balancing act, by introducing a medium-term oil supply balancing mechanism that in the long run will prove supportive to the oil market, and especially so to non-shale oil producers.Analysis Non-OPEC production trends following the oil crash in 2014 are instrumental in demonstrating the points discussed in the introduction. Following the oil crash of late 2014, U.S. crude production (lower 48 ex-GOM) declined by one million barrels (EIA data) between December 2014 and December 2016:(Click to enlarge)Shale oil which represented 70 percent of U.S. crude production on December 2014 (5.23M barrels) declined by 690K barrels, representing a 13 percent decline during that same time frame. U.S. shale oil production declined by 5.2 percent in the first year to 4.97M barrels (December 2015), and then declined by an additional 8.6 percent in the following year to 4.54M (December 2016).

2018-12-31,"Oil markets have always been cyclical, and now even more so with advanced electronic trading, more speculation (which often results in wider oil price swings) and more producers, including the resurgence of U.S. oil production, now reaching over 11 million barrels per day. Added to the cocktail of uncertainty are also a myriad of geopolitical and economic factors, including ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions, angst of U.S. Federal Reserve policy, and wars in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, which make it increasingly difficult to forecast the direction for future oil prices.This dynamic has proven true over the past two-and-a-half months as market pundits have watched (often in amazement) how global oil prices reached multi-year highs in October, only to quickly plunge by 40 percent to date. Prices for global oil benchmark, London-traded Brent crude futures were trading in the mid-$80’s range in early October, while U.S. oil benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were hovering in the mid $70’s-range, a comfortable price point for U.S. shale oil producers, and around $25per barrel above the average oil production break-even point for shale producers.However, amid all of the dismal economic news and problematic geopolitical developments, a group of bankers are sounding optimistic once again over future oil price forecasts. On Friday, Bloomberg said that many of the world’s largest banks are forecasting a rebound in oil prices next year as fears of a recession prove misplaced.According to a Bloomberg survey of oil analysts, Brent will average $70 a barrel in 2019, almost a third higher than its price on Thursday. Michael Cohen, head of energy and commodities research at Barclays Plc in New York, said “we could even see something similar to a V-shaped recovery next year, on two very important conditions. One, that the reduction in OPEC exports leads to a reduction in inventories. And two, that we don’t see a further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.”The Bloomberg report added that despite a recent darkening outlook for the global economy amid prolonged trade disputes between the U.S. and China, and as the U.S. Federal Reserve embarks on tightening monetary policy, most commentators aren’t seeing an actual recession biting the oil market next year. The median forecast of 24 oil analysts in the Bloomberg survey projects that Brent crude futures will average exactly $70 a barrel in 2019. The price on Thursday was about $53.50 while the average so far in 2018 has been about $72. Meanwhile, the median forecast for WTI is $61.13. WTI futures traded at about $45.27 on Monday.  Related: Low Oil Prices Could Cripple Texas Job GrowthMichael Tran, a commodities strategist at RBC Capital Markets LLC, said that prices are nearing a bottom, while ““global supply and demand should reach a fine balance next year.” Bloomberg added that in the absence of a severe economic slump, most analysts anticipate that world oil consumption will continue to expand at roughly the pace seen in recent years, powered by emerging economies such as China.Downplaying the trade war variable?However, though the analysts surveyed by Bloomberg give credence to ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, it appears that unless a new trade deal is reached by the self-imposed March 2 deadline between the two sides, global oil demand will indeed recede amid more sluggish global economic growth, led by a slow down in Chinese manufacturing and exports. Since the U.S. and China are the world’s two largest economies, ongoing trade tensions are already hitting global supply chains, particularly in Asia. Numerous manufacturing companies have already exited China for greener pastures, including setting up shop in neighboring Southeast Asian economic tiger Vietnam.Japan, the world’s third largest economy and a major importer of both crude oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG), for its part, is already suffering economic fall out from the U.S.-China trade spate. In September, the Tokyo-based Nikkei Asian Review said that at least 60 percent of top Japanese companies expected earnings to be hurt by the trade war. If Washington and Beijing can’t reach a formal trade war cease-fire by March 2, that 60 percent figure could likely include nearly all top Japanese companies, while Japan’s GDP would also take a hit, as would oil demand growth in the country.A protracted trade war between the U.S. and China will also hit other OECD members. Last month, the group of developed economies downgraded its global growth forecast from 3.7 percent to 3.5 percent in 2019 and 2020. However, that growth forecast could likely be readjusted if the U.S. hikes existing tariffs on $200 bn worth of Chinese products to as high as 25 percent while slapping fresh duties on another $267 bn worth of Chinese exports would exacerbate the problem.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/70-Oil-Could-Be-Right-Around-The-Corner.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 11:32 | Tim Daiss","Dec 31, 2018",$70 Oil Could Be Right Around The Corner
2018-12-31,"The explosive growth of U.S. shale production has capped gains of international and U.S. oil prices, offsetting OPEC’s production cuts in the first half of the year and contributing to an emerging oil glut in the latter half in 2018.  OPEC has now forged a new pact with its Russia-led non-OPEC allies to contain the oil price decline to $50 a barrel Brent—a price that is not enough to balance any budget of a Middle Eastern oil producer.But the consequences of rising U.S. light oil production from the shale fields have also rippled through international oil flows and trade, making OPEC’s heavyweights such as Saudi Arabia fight for keeping market share in their most prized market and the world’s fastest-growing oil consumption region, Asia.Thanks to the booming shale production, U.S. light oil exports have increased, taking market shares out of the lighter grades that Saudi Arabia and its fellow OPEC members are exporting to Asia.Moreover, increased crude oil production in the U.S. has also resulted in higher oil product exports which, combined with higher Chinese refined product exports, have created an oversupply of products in Asia, crashing refining margins earlier in December.U.S. crude oil production has been breaking records in recent months, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Total U.S. petroleum exports have also been setting records over the past year, EIA data shows.U.S. light crude oil exports to Asia have also grown and even with China shunning American crude, U.S. sales to OPEC’s key market Asia have held relatively steady since August this year, according to data from Kpler compiled by Bloomberg.  Related: Low Oil Prices Could Cripple Texas Job GrowthAs OPEC is getting ready for another round of production cuts beginning January, Saudi Arabia for example is hell-bent on keeping its market share in Asia and has recently slashed the January prices of all its grades going to Asia, while it raised the prices for all grades bound for the U.S., Northwest Europe, and the Mediterranean. Saudi Aramco’s deepest cuts in Asian pricing were for the Super Light and Extra Light grades, slashed by US$2 and $1.50 a barrel from December’s prices, respectively. The official selling prices (OSPs) of Arab Light, Medium, and Heavy were also cut, by between $0.40 and $1.00 a barrel.The deepest cuts in the lighter grades reflect Saudi Arabia’s effort to keep its market share in Asia as competition from U.S. light oil intensifies, according to analysts.“Lights are [cut] very aggressively,” a sour crude oil trader told S&P Global Platts in early December, commenting on the Saudi pricing for Asia for January.“Guess they are trying to prevent too much US arb inflow,” the trader said.Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members also have to contend with increased refined product exports out of the U.S., as well as China, which are creating a glut of gasoline and naphtha, depressing refining margins in Asia.Related: ExxonMobil Faces Off With Venezuela’s NavyIn early December, the gasoline refining margin at the Singapore hub, viewed as a benchmark for Asia, slumped to a loss and to the lowest level against Brent prices since November 2011. Loss-making gasoline margins weighed on Asia’s overall refining profits, which hit in early December their lowest since August 2016, despite crumbling crude oil prices, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon, as carried by Reuters.China is reportedly raising its fuel export quota for 2019 by 13 percent, which could additionally weigh on product oversupply.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, this year average monthly U.S. exports to Asia of light distillates—including gasoline and naphtha—have been nearly triple the export levels over the past two years. The gasoline and other oil products glut comes just as OPEC and allies start the new production cuts of 1.2 million bpd. Faced with U.S. competition of lighter grades in Asia, OPEC and its largest producer Saudi Arabia are fighting hard for their market share in their prized export destination.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Shale-Challenges-OPECs-Oil-Dominance-In-Asia.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 11:29 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 31, 2018",U.S. Shale Challenges OPEC’s Oil Dominance In Asia
2018-12-31,"Canada’s drilling rig count fell by 61 rigs in the last week of December from a week earlier, with the annual decline at 66 rigs, per the latest weekly rig count report by Baker Hughes. As Canadian drillers gear up for winter season, the rig count usually drops before the end of the year, this year, the figures add a more grim shade to the landscape of the Canadian oil industry, which this year suffered a major slump of the local benchmark, Western Canadian Select, to West Texas Intermediate, at one time dipping to a discount of over US$50 to WTI.Over the last two weeks of the month and the year, according to the data, the number of active drilling rigs deployed in Canada fell by a combined 104 to just 70, highlighting the effect of low local oil prices but also the obligatory production cuts enforced by the Albertan government to arrest the slide in prices and clear excessive crude oil inventory.The production cut will begin at a rate of 325,000 bpd, to be reduced to 95,000 bpd once the excess supply is cleared, which is expected to happen within three months. Afterwards, the cuts will be in place until the end of next year.Not everyone in the local oil industry is thrilled with the production cut. Suncor was against it when the idea was first floated, proposed by the chief executive of peer Cenovus. Most large companies in the field, who also have processing capacity, are better placed to weather the effects of the lower prices as they refine their own crude oil. Premier Notley has also floated the idea of building a new refinery in Alberta that would absorb more of the oil that is produced in the province instead of shipping it to U.S. refiners at cut-throat rates.According to Canadian media reports from earlier this month, Albertan energy companies were interested in expanding the province’s processing capacity. Alberta has four refineries at present, with a combined refining capacity of 475,000 bpd. There are also two other specialized diesel-producing facilities that can refine 110,000 bpd of crude.A new refinery would indeed serve to stabilize prices of Canadian crude, but there is one problem: a refinery cannot be built in a month, even in a year. What’s more, some experts argue that Canada’s oil province already has too much refining capacity and the only solution to its price problem are more pipelines.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Canadian-Rig-Count-Slumps-At-Year-End.html,"Dec 31, 2018 at 10:30 | Irina Slav","Dec 31, 2018",Canadian Rig Count Slumps At Year-End
