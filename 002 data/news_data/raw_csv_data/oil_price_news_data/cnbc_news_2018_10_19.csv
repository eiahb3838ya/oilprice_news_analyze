2018-10-19,"Russian authorities have announced that domestic oil production hit 11.36 million barrels per day (bpd), on average, in September (Vedomosti, October 2). This marks a new historic peak, rea­ched despite the often-cited poor shape of the Russian economy and negative impact of Western sanctions, not to mention the restrictions self-imposed on Moscow by the 2016 deal with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (see Jamestown.org, March 8). Commenting on this fact, Vagit Alekperov, LukOIL’s CEO and principal shareholder, assumed the cur­rent out­put levels cannot be sustained, arguing that Russia has already reached the li­mit of its oil pro­duction capacity. On the other hand, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak strongly disagreed (Neftegaz.ru, October 3).Alekperov’s estimate should be considered with at least so­me degree of skepticism. First of all, such bearish assessments have be­en made—incorrectly—many times in the past. Back in 2005, then–deputy prime minister Viktor Khristenko predic­ted that oil production, at that time at 9.6 million bpd, would definitely decline after 2010 (Versia, August 25, 2016). And four years later, Mikhail Krutikhin, one of Russia’s most respected energy analysts, told Western journalists, “We now see production peaked last year,” so, “I believe the decline will continue for quite a number of years” (BBC News, April 15, 2008). Several other notable examples of suggestions that the Russian oil output had peaked could also be mentioned. And until recently, the consensus forecast for 2020 stood at 10.2 million bpd—i.e., more than 10 percent below the rate recorded last month.Could Russia’s oil output continue to grow in the years to come? Such a scenario is certainly probable, but it will only be achieved as long as several difficult conditions are rectified.Related: Carbon Pricing Won't Kill Big OilFirst of all, one must look at developments not only in Russia but in neighboring countries as well. Current Russian production, though a record, is only 1.7 percent abo­ve the levels of 1989, the most successful year for the Soviet oil and gas industry. To com­pare, oil output in Kazakhstan was, in 2017, 3.3 times higher than in 1989; while last year’s production in Azerbaijan, whose deposits were previously considered the most exhausted in all of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), were 2.9 times greater than that recorded in the Azeri SSR for 1990 (Bp.com, June 2018, accessed October 17). This data proves a simple fact: output figures in the former Soviet space have depended strongly on the presence of Western technology in the domestic industry and upon the governments’ efforts to explore new oil fields in order to substitute old and overexploited ones. Of course, all this is further subject to two critical factors. The first is the global price of oil, which can make the development of the least accessible depo­sits profitable: if the price exceeds $120 per barrel, Russia would be able to explore and to make operational its giant Arctic oil deposits, thus adding at least 20–30 percent to current production levels (Forbes.ru, April 21, 2017). The second factor is the level of free competiti­on bet­ween national “champions” and multinational majors: in Kazakhstan, for example, the sha­re of foreign com­panies in oil production in the early 2010s exceeded 65 percent (Isc.hbs.edu, Wikipedia—Russian version, accessed October 17).The next condition dictating whether Russian oil production levels can keep growing is the inherent efficiency of the domestic extraction industry. Even after around two decades of increasing investment, Russian oil companies still produce only 28–33 percent of oil from their wells; the average figure for British producers re­aches 42–43 percent (Neftegaz.ru, December 18, 2013; Ogauthority.co.uk, September 2017). This results from the government’s policies, which do not place any strict regulations on recovery at existing deposits. Were the recovery rates to rise at least to the average level of European firms, Russia would be able to add (at least theoretically) up to 800,000 barrels to its daily output. In fact, it would also result in longer service lives for existing oilfields. The Russian government has repeatedly shown an inability to press domestic ener­gy companies to adopt new technologies, and attempts to set tighter standards has failed many times. Perhaps the most dramatic example of the latter occurred in early 2011, when a full-scale fuel crisis erupted in Russia after low-quality gasoline was banned from the market due to the inability of the largest state-controlled company, Rosneft, to meet new go­vernment regulations (Kommersant, April 29, 2011).  Related: What Killed The Oil Price Rally?Third, Russia’s oil output has for years been held back by a lack of com­pe­tition in the domestic energy market. In too many cases, private companies are banned from exploring new deposits. Illustratively, only those corporations that are majority-controlled by the state may drill offshore or in the Far North territories. Additionally, giant (or so-called “strategic”) fields can be awarded to state-owned corporations (first of all to Gazprom, Ros­neft, or Gazpromneft) without obligatory auctions, and sometimes even for free (RBC, July 30, 2015). The result of these uncompetitive policies has been, in part, to keep overall production levels lower than they might otherwise have been. And another important trend worth highlighting is the fact that many state-owned companies are now trying to secure not only dominant, but monopolistic positions within the oil-and-gas-extraction sector—and monopolies, as a rule, tend to contribute to lower growth rates. For example, last year, Rosneft managed to wrest control over Bashneft, a regional company that was declared “illegally privatized” several years before. When it operated as a private en­tity, Bashneft increased production from 230,000 to 432,000 bpd between 2007 and 2016. However, in 2017, its production fell by 3.6 percent due primarily to the ineffectiveness of Rosneft’s management (Oilru.com, February 12, 2008; Arsagera.ru, March 21, 2018). If one ta­kes into account that currently there are fewer than 300 oil and gas companies operating in Rus­sia, with more than 90 percent of overall output coming from just 12 of them (in the United States, there exists more than 9,000 of such enter­prises, with 54 percent of US oil and 85 percent of US natural gas produced by small independent firms) (Neftok.ru, Ipaa.org, accessed October 17), the successes of the Russian oil industry look at best quite modest.Arguably, Russian oil production co­mes not due to the government’s policies, but actually despite them. Therefo­re, if the country chooses to embrace modern principles of state regulation and opens its oil and gas industry to foreign competition, domestic output levels will almost certainly be free to continue to grow, and quite significantly.By The Jamestown FoundationMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Are-Claims-Of-Peak-Oil-Production-In-Russia-Overblown.html,"Oct 19, 2018 at 17:25 | The Jamestown Foundation ","Oct 19, 2018",Are Claims Of Peak Oil Production In Russia Overblown?
2018-10-19,"Oil prices at $80 a barrel are too high and unhealthy for the world today, Bob Dudley, the chief executive of UK supermajor BP, said on the sidelines of an event on Friday.“There’s a healthy price for oil and energy and I believe that balances producing countries and consuming countries,” Quartz quoted Dudley as saying on the sidelines of the conference One Young World in The Hague. “In my mind, it’s somewhere between $50 and $65 a barrel. The world can live with this,” Dudley noted.Emerging and developing economies like India, South Africa, or Turkey are seeing their highest-ever prices of gasoline because their currencies have rapidly depreciated against the U.S. dollar and because oil prices in dollars are high, BP’s chief executive said.Currently, oil prices are “artificially high” due to Venezuela “defying gravity” and to the U.S. sanctions on Iran, according to Dudley, who said that once those geopolitical events subside, fundamentals will return to rule the market and prices should return back to $60-$65 a barrel.BP won’t be joining any EU special purpose vehicle designed to keep trade with Iran flowing, Dudley stressed, noting that “I think it’s full of risk.”  Related: What Killed The Oil Price Rally?The concerns of BP’s chief executive that $80 oil is unhealthy for the world are shared by major international organizations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Expensive energy is back and it is threatening global economic growth, the IEA said in its Oil Market Report last week.Also last week, the IMF slightly downgraded its projection for global growth for this year and next—at 3.7 percent, growth is now expected 0.2 percentage point lower than IMF’s forecast from April this year. The key reasons for the downgrade included trade disputes, geopolitical tensions, and a weaker outlook for emerging economies due to higher oil import bills, among other factors, according to the IMF.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/BP-CEO-80-Oil-Is-Unhealthy-For-The-World.html,"Oct 19, 2018 at 17:24 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 19, 2018",BP CEO: $80 Oil Is Unhealthy For The World
2018-10-19,"Growing Permian drilling and production started lifting last year the revenues and profits of the world’s top oilfield service providers who were badly bruised by the 2014 oil price crash.Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes saw their earnings in the past few quarters lifted by the return of frenzied drilling in North America, led by the Permian basin, while international operations lagged amid slower recovery in global investments in exploration and production.In July this year, the mood at Schlumberger and Baker Hughes in Q2 earnings was an upbeat outlook for the immediate future, with signs that the international market outside the U.S. was also on the road to recovery.But the top oilfield service providers started warning in September that the Permian constraints would temporarily slow down activity in the most-active U.S. shale region.Luckily for all three of them, the international business looks increasingly positive as global spending on exploration and production is beginning to recover, rising this year—albeit slightly—for the first time since 2014.Analysts expect all three top oilfield service companies to report higher earnings for the third quarter compared to last year, but they have been cutting their projections in recent weeks due to the takeaway capacity constraints in the Permian expected to reduce drilling activity.“In North America, lack of additional pipeline capacity in the Permian Basin is becoming an increasing constraint to production growth,” Schlumberger Chairman and CEO Paal Kibsgaard said as early as in July on the Q2 earnings release.  Related: What Killed The Oil Price Rally?In September, Kibsgaard said at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference that the market consensus that the Permian would continue to provide 1.5 million bpd of annual production growth for the foreseeable future “is now starting to be called into question.”“In fact, so far in the third quarter, the hydraulic fracturing market has already softened significantly more than we expected in spite of the overall rig count holding up relatively well,” Schlumberger’s head said, but added that international E&P spending has been picking up pace in the second half of the year.At the same conference in early September, Jeff Miller, CEO at the leader on the U.S. fracking market, Halliburton, said that in order to overcome takeaway constraints in the Permian, “some operators will re-allocate capital to other basins, some will slowdown, other will build ducts.”As early as in Q2 earnings, Halliburton had warned about a downturn in activity in North America due to budget constraints and takeaway issues.“There has been and it’s more than we expected,” Miller said last month, adding that weakness in pricing in several basins plus project delays in the Middle East would impact Halliburton’s Q3 earnings by between $0.08 to $0.10 per share.But international markets are recovering, and this is where the top three oilfield service providers would look for more drilling and activity.Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said at the September Barclays conference that global E&P spending is expected to grow at a healthy pace over the next three to four years.Related: Oil’s $133 Billion Black Market“We are also seeing the beginnings of a recovery in the international markets. We’re expecting offshore activity to see a healthy rebound as well. It will likely remain significantly below prior-cycle peak levels but at the same time we see improving activity, and importantly, more stability as we look into the next few years,” Simonelli noted.Both Baker Hughes and Halliburton see the North Sea and the Middle East as the key growth areas internationally, although Halliburton’s Miller warned in July that “How much improvement and how quickly it comes will depend in large part upon commodity prices and equipment absorption.”  Higher oil prices and lowered development and project costs have led to cautious optimism and measured risk-taking within the industry that is set to see an uptick in global oil investment this year, energy consultants Wood Mackenzie say.Rystad Energy expected in May that 100 new offshore projects are likely to be sanctioned this year, compared to just 60 projects in 2017 and fewer than 40 in 2016.The world’s top oilfield service providers will be betting on international E&P spending recovery, while they are waiting for the Permian constraints to abate, probably sometime at the end of 2019.""…while the current Permian takeaway constraints in North America should be addressed within the next 12 to 18 months, a series of reservoir- and production-related challenges is emerging in the US shale basins that could dampen the most optimistic production growth projections,"" Schlumberger’s CEO said today in its press release on its Q3 earnings.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oilfield-Service-Companies-Bet-On-Full-Recovery.html,"Oct 19, 2018 at 17:24 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 19, 2018",Oilfield Service Companies Bet On Full Recovery
2018-10-19,"BRAZIL C&C PRODUCTIONBrazil and Petrobras show something in common with U.S. LTO: even with a lot of debt and desire, and a strong resource base it is difficult to raise production in the face of high decline rates. It may also be a lesson for the world as oil prices rise and activity picks up; it is by far the most active conventional oil region with many major projects at various stages of completion, but facing delays and schedule crowding so oil production has continued a slow decline, contrary to expectations from last year. In July new production again did not quite match overall decline, mostly because of delays in start-ups of FPSOs planned for this year, and at 2575 kbpd was down 14 kbpd or 0.5% m-o-m and 48 kbpd or 1.8% y-o-y (data from ANP).(Click to enlarge) Two FPSOs were started in 2017: Lula Extension Sul (P-66) at 150 kbpd nameplate and Pioneiro de Libra, an extended well test project on the Mero field, at 50 kbpd. Both are now about at design throughput. Two other FPSOs completed ramp up in 2017. In 2018 three FPSOs have started up: Atlanta a small early production system at 20 kbpd, Bezios-1 (P-74) in the Santos basin at 150 kbpd and FPSO Cidade de Campos dos Goytacazes on the Tartaruga Verde field in Campos, also at 150 kbpd. There were three other FPSOs due for the Buzios field (P-75, 76 and 77) but at least one is delayed till next year. There are now four planned FPSOs remaining to be started up this year, all in the fourth quarter: P-75 and P-76 plus P-67 (Lula Norte) and P-69 (Lula Extremo Sul) in the Lula field (each 150 kbpd nameplate). Even for a company the size of Petrobras that seems a very tight schedule for commissioning large, complex plant, so one or two may slip to next year and all may be so late as to make little difference to this year’s numbers. See Reuters for more details.Into next year there may be problems with shortage of deep water drilling rigs, Petrobras cancelled some following the price crash and there have been reports of them looking for available rigs now: no rig, no well, no oil, no matter what the available surface processing capacity. Offshore rig numbers, by Baker Hughes, have averaged around ten over the last couple of years, unless they add numbers then the overall ramp-up will remain as it has been and production will stay about flat.FPSOs P-68 (Berbigao & Sururu) and P-70 (Atapu) are due next year, together with any delayed from this, but the ramp-up from this year’s FPSOs is likely to dominate production growth. There are none due for 2020. Note Petrobras projects have a hull name (P-), a vessel name (often named after a city), a field name (sometimes two or three) plus, often, a separate name (e.g. MV-) from the leasing company, and they often change these during development by reassigning hulls to different destinations, so my apologies if I’ve got some of the above wrong.There’s been a lot of activity since 2016 despite the price crash and Petrobras debt and corruption problems, and yet production has slightly declined. Typically the large FPSOs at around 150 kbpd take 14 to 22 months to ramp up (see below), adding 8 or so production wells and 4 to 6 injection wells, but two are needed per year to overcome decline rates, and that may be increasing with higher overall production and some of the newer Santos vessels reaching end of plateau. It’s also noteworthy that the mature Campos fields have been showing accelerated decline and a marked jump in water cut recently, although the overall basin decline will be ameliorated by the start-up of the latest FPSO.Petrobras production is falling faster than overall production, partly from sales of older fields but also because it has a lower ownership ratio of the new (growing) fields than of the mature (declining) ones.(Click to enlarge) The chart above shows how recent production wells have been added. I haven’t found any data for injection wells.(Click to enlarge) BRAZIL NATURAL GAS PRODUCTIONBrazil is not a large natural gas producer relative to oil, and what it does produce looks like it might be plateauing. The new pre-salt oil production has associated gas which is high in carbon dioxide: the Lula field is 15%, but is being produced commercially, while the Mero field (ex Libra) is 45%, which is not commercial and will be re-injected for pressure support. There are currently no rigs drilling for gas, and only about one or two since 2011, so near term, new gas production will be associated with oil, and gas imports are likely to be increasing. The largest recent gas discovery was the Jupiter field in the Santos basin, which was originally cited as having over 3 Gboe of gas, but it too is high in carbon dioxide and the current number looks to be around 1 Gboe, with gas re-injection being in the exploitation plan (e.g. for the recently approved Sepia FPSO).(Click to enlarge) BRAZIL RESERVESOILBrazil reserves are issued by ANP each year. Unlike other regimes they give 1P (proven) and 3P (proven, probable and possible) numbers, but not 2P. As 2P is usually closest to what actually gets produced I’ve estimated it just as an average of the 1P and 3P numbers.The reserves had big boosts from new field discoveries in 2010 and 2014 but since then estimated ultimate recovery has declined slightly, probably influenced by the oil price drop, but maybe also because of the results of appraisal drilling or performance from existing fields (e.g. The Buzios filed, just now coming on line, has been downgraded from original reserves of 4.5 Gb to 3.1 Gb).(Click to enlarge)NATURAL GASRemaining gas reserves peaked in 2014 and both 1P and 3P numbers have declined since. Estimated ultimate recovery has also declined slightly since 2014 (more so if the contingent numbers are taken out). The associated gas for the Mero (ex Libra) discovery in 2010 seems to be included, which I would have expected not to be the case given that the gas is non-commercial at the moment. Overall the reserve trends support there being a coming production plateau or peak.(Click to enlarge) BRAZIL C&C PROJECTIONI had a go at projecting Brail production based on production history, estimated 2P reserves and planned projects. The production for “Land” and “Other” basins is just a best-fit exponential decline with area matched to reserves. “Campos” is fitted with a generalized Verhulst equation, I used two cycles to try to capture the production dip in 2013, but it didn’t really work. Campos basin is mature so the 2P reserves should be fairly close to final recovery and most development opportunities have been identified, though there will likely be some future discoveries and extensions through redevelopments (a recent Wood-Mackenzie analysis found that “redeveloping the basin’s mature oil fields could extend the life of the basin and add more than 200,000 boed to its declining production by 2025” – I doubt if Wood-Mac have ever be accused of underestimating any number following the word “could”.“Santos” is the main area for development at the moment and I’ve used a bottom up approach by identified FPSOs there (see below).Future discoveries haven’t been included. Exploration is planned in various leases in the “Others” areas, including deep water Sergipe and Foz do Amazonas (which neighbours the Guyana area where ExxonMobil has had recent success but is also highly environmentally sensitive). There are also opportunities in Santos for extension to the new fields. A recent analysis by Jean Laherrere shows about 772 Gb remaining reserves (discovered and undiscovered) based on a Hubbert Linearisation method, which would imply there is around 50 Gb yet to be discovered (i.e. equivalent to four or five more Santos basins).Note for comparing units 1000 mmbbls/year is about 2740 kbpd.(Click to enlarge) The chart below shows the bottom up estimate for the Santos basin. The FPSOs in the legend are shown in black if online, blue for under development, and green for planned and under appraisal. The numbers in brackets gives the nominal nameplate capacity. The total remaining reserve (area under the curve shown after 2017 plus run out after 2037) is equal to the 2P estimate of 11.8 Gb given above.The curve is nicely symmetric but looks a bit squashed up so it might be that it gets flattened out a bit with delays or, equally, there will be some growth on the back end. It won’t be as smooth as shown either: this year might be flat or down before picking up and a heavy maintenance load or a couple of major accidents could show a clear dip for a year.Petrobras has said it will be producing its own FPSOs after 2023, rather than leasing established designs (but like all companies, and not only those under heavy political influence, it says lots of things that don’t always pan out) and that would likely involve a learning period and slower developments; and would mostly be applicable only to new discoveries, a few of the last projects on existing fields or, possibly, some redevelopment projects There are possible upsides in the Mero and Buzios fields, but equally some Brazilian discoveries have disappointed and it’s still relatively early days in the pre-salt exploitation.The big FPSOs seem to be developed for around 500 mmbbls of oil reserve each and to have about 25% decline rates coming off plateau, but there aren’t many that have reached late life yet so these could go either way. What is almost unique for Brazil compared with other countries is that the FPSOs hit plateaus that almost exactly match the nameplate, I have never seen any attempt to accelerate production by running above the nameplate in the early years, which would happen in a typical North Sea field; there do seem to be some projects that don’t achieve nameplate but relatively few. I don’t know if this is because the FPSOs are usually cloned rather than bespoke designs, or because of the nature of the wells, or something to do with the regulatory regime.(Click to enlarge) BRAZIL PETROLEUM IMPORTS AND EXPORTSJuly showed a large and anomalous jump in crude exports and product imports (by dollar value), which looks like refinery availability issues but might turn out to be a reporting problem. Overall, though, Brazil is maintaining net export (by value) for petroleum goods and it looks like it is increasing internal refining capacity so crude exports and product imports have both been gradually decreasing. On that trend (ignoring July) net production of products would exceed local demand in the near future. On the other hand natural gas imports have been rising and that may need to accelerate.(Click to enlarge) By George Kaplan via Peakoilbarrel.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Brazils-Offshore-Boom-Is-Facing-The-Same-Problem-As-US-Shale.html,"Oct 19, 2018 at 17:23 | Ron Patterson","Oct 19, 2018",Brazil’s Offshore Boom Is Facing The Same Problem As U.S. Shale
2018-10-19,"Exxon is betting very big on Africa for its next big find, the supermajor’s head of exploration, Stephen Greenlee, told Bloomberg in an interview. In fact, Greenlee said, Exxon was hoping to strike a discovery of a billion barrels or more in Africa: what is known in the industry as an elephant, Bloomberg’s Kevin Crowley reports.The U.S. Geological Survey estimated that two years ago there were at least 41 billion untapped barrels of crude oil in sub-Saharan Africa alone. Exxon is focusing on western and southern Africa in its exploration work and has been amassing stakes in oil and gas prospect in Ghana, Mauritania, Namibia, and South Africa.In Ghana, Exxon tried to buy Kosmos Energy’s stake in the giant Jubilee offshore field in 2009, but the deal was blocked by the Ghana authorities. Last year, the supermajor bought straight from the Ghana government exploration rights for an adjacent block, and plans were to begin working on it this year.In Namibia, it bought a 30-percent stake in an offshore exploration license. Although no oil has yet been discovered in Namibia, there is a theory that its offshore basins may share characteristics with Brazil’s Campos and Santos—Brazil and Namibia were part of one whole a few billion years ago.Exxon is also buying seismic data. “We’re acquiring large amounts of seismic data with the idea that in the future one or two of those are going to turn out to be the next Guyana,” Greenlee said. “These are large acreage positions and they’re in areas that we think have promising opportunities for hydrocarbon systems.”Perhaps the Guyana discovery—an elephant containing an estimated 4 billion barrels of crude—spurred hopes for another one in less explored parts of the world that are nevertheless close to established production sites such as Nigeria and Angola.

2018-10-19,"OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies are struggling to fully deliver on the oil production increase of 1 million bpd promised in June, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting an internal OPEC document that it has seen.OPEC and allies agreed in June to relax compliance rates with the cuts to 100 percent from the previous over-compliance. The respective leaders of the OPEC and non-OPEC nations part of the deal—Saudi Arabia and Russia—have been interpreting the eased compliance as adding a total of 1 million bpd to the market.The document that Reuters has seen, however, showed that the significant production increases in Saudi Arabia and Russia were offset by declines in Iran, Venezuela and Angola within OPEC, and by production drops in Mexico, Kazakhstan, and Malaysia from non-OPEC.Increasing production “is a work in progress,” OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said this week. At an event in India he also reiterated OPEC’s position that “our current view is that the market is at the moment adequately supplied and well-balanced, though in a fragile state.”According to the internal OPEC document prepared for a technical panel meeting scheduled for Friday, OPEC—excluding Nigeria, Libya, and Congo—increased its combined production by 428,000 bpd in September compared to May. Saudi Arabia put the most extra barrels on the market and boosted its production by 524,000 bpd in September compared to May. Iraq, Kuwait, and the United Arab (UAE) also increased their production, according to the document seen by Reuters.However, Iran’s production slumped by 376,000 bpd in September from May, Venezuela’s output plunged by 189,000 bpd, and Angola saw its production drop by 17,000 bpd between May and September.The non-OPEC partners in the deal have increased their combined production by 296,000 bpd since May. Russia boosted production by 389,000 bpd, but part of that increase was offset by declines in Kazakhstan, Mexico, and Malaysia.
