2018-08-01,"The Trump administration is considering another ramp up of the trade war with China, a move that could begin to rattle the global economy.The Wall Street Journal reports that the Trump administration is considering ratcheting up the tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports from the proposed 10 percent levy to as much as 25 percent. Hiking the tariff, Trump’s advisers seem to think, will force Beijing to back down and offer major concessions. Whether or not those tariffs move forward remains to be seen, and the administration reportedly won’t make a decision until later this month.The tariffs are justified, the Trump administration says, because the Chinese yuan continues to depreciate, undercutting U.S. competitiveness. “Once you go down the road of using tariffs to disrupt the Chinese, you have to say 25% compared to 10%,” Derek Scissors, a China expert at the American Enterprise Institute and adviser to the administration on trade, told the WSJ.The problem with that logic is that the tariffs are part of the reason why China’s currency is under pressure. To be sure, China’s economy is showing other signs of trouble, from slowing growth to a rise in corporate defaults. But the yuan, which is fixed against the dollar, recently ran into rocky waters, at least in part driven by fears of the U.S.-China trade war.Moreover, the rate tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve is also putting pressure on Beijing.Morgan Stanley estimates U.S. GDP would lose a percentage point if the Trump administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on all imports from China and Europe, while China would lose 1.5 percentage points. “Growth overall is still there, and while there are risks, it’s holding up. The big picture of a trade war and protectionism is that it is a slow death - a death by a thousand paper cuts instead of anything sudden and shocking,” Richard Kelly, head of global strategy at TD Securities, said in a Reuters interview.

Some analysts argue it wouldn’t even make much of a difference in terms of total demand. U.S. exporters could simply reroute shipments elsewhere, and because China would have to make up for lost U.S. imports, it would be buying from elsewhere as well. So, oil flows would be reshuffled, rather than significantly interrupted. Still, U.S. exporters might have to offer discounts to other buyers if they lose the Chinese market.More broadly, however, the effect of tariffs on consumer demand could be significant. The initial $34 billion has only been lightly felt in the U.S., but moving forward with tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports would mean higher prices for a long list of consumer goods, acting as a drag on household income. Ultimately, that could begin to cut into gasoline consumption. More expensive consumer goods comes hot on the heels of the sharp increase in retail gasoline prices this year. According to the EIA, gasoline demand dipped by 40,000 bpd in May, year-on-year. Industrial activity would also slow down, further cutting into demand.

It is hard to put solid figures on the downside risk, especially with so much still up in the air.“While the likelihood that creeping US protectionism spins out into a broader trade war has unfortunately moved from tail risk to plausible scenario, we believe that cooler heads will ultimately prevail,” Scotiabank wrote in a note, “that the world economy will be spared the worst of mercantilism’s potential casualties, and that commodity prices will rebound through summer’s end.”Unfortunately, whether or not that prediction proves accurate largely depends on the decision-making in the White House, which, needless to say, is rather unpredictable.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Next-Trade-War-Escalation-Will-Hit-US-Oil.html,"Aug 01, 2018 at 16:40 | Nick Cunningham","Aug 01, 2018",The Next Trade War Escalation Will Hit U.S. Oil
2018-08-01,"U.S. crude oil production is growing, but at a slower pace than predicted.American oil production in May actually inched down from April by 0.3 percent, according to EIA’s Monthly Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production report. U.S. crude oil production for the month of May stood at 10.442 million bpd, compared to 10.472 million bpd in April.The figure for May, based on surveys of producers, is down by nearly 300,000 bpd compared to the earlier EIA estimate for 10.749 million bpd oil production for May, with this estimate based on forecasts.The weekly estimates for May all point to more than 10.7 million bpd of crude oil production, but the more accurate—albeit lagged—data, based on survey of producers, shows that U.S. oil output had trailed projections by around 300,000 bpd.To be sure, production jumped from a year ago—by 13.3 percent from the 9.217 million bpd production in May last year.The EIA currently estimates that the June production would be 10.900 million bpd, but the revision to the May figure suggests that the output for June could be lower than the expected 10.9 million bpd, according to Bloomberg.The data for May is still subject to further revision, EIA spokesman Paul Hesse told Bloomberg.  Related: Was The Aramco IPO Destined To Fail?In the monthly crude oil production report this week, the EIA revised up the production numbers for April, by 5,000 bpd.EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) from July forecasts that U.S. crude oil production will average 10.8 million bpd this year, up from 9.4 million bpd in 2017. Crude oil production is currently expected to average 11.8 million bpd in 2019.For oil prices, EIA expects Brent Crude spot prices to average $73 a barrel in the second half of 2018 and $69 per barrel in 2019, with WTI Crude averaging $6 a barrel lower than Brent prices in the second half of 2018 and $7 per barrel lower in 2019.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Production-Isnt-Growing-As-Fast-As-Expected.html,"Aug 01, 2018 at 13:52 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Aug 01, 2018",U.S. Oil Production Isn’t Growing As Fast As Expected
2018-08-01,"Kuwait is pumping crude at a daily rate of 2.8 million barrels, the most since December 2016, the country’s oil minister Bakheet al-Rashidi said today as quoted by S&P Platts. This is 90,000 bpd more than Kuwait’s June daily production and the figure highlights the difficulties the cartel faces in boosting production quickly enough to rein in prices: OPEC’s total, as estimated by analysts, only rose by 70,000 bpd in July.As OPEC ramps up production in response to vocal disgruntlement with oil prices, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are preparing to restart production in the Neutral Zone, which could bring another half a million barrels daily to global supply. The restart will likely take place no sooner than December.Separately, the minister said that the oil market is approaching stability. This is something the market was supposed to have done earlier this year, before it turned out those price levels were not exactly optimal for buyers.Now, things have changed. “It is clear today based on the current level of production that we are approaching a very stable stage ... whether for the consumers or the producers,” Al-Rashidi said, as quoted by Reuters.Kuwait is not stopping at current production rates, either. The foreign-investment division of the country’s state-owned oil company, Kufpec, has borrowed US$1.1 billion to develop shale oil resources abroad, notably in Canada.Kufpec’s current daily production stands at 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent, but the company aims to raise this to 119,000 in September and further to 150,000 bpd in 2020. In Canada, Kufpec pumps just 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent daily but plans to expand this significantly after the drilling of 2,000 more wells in the Alberta shale patch.Kuwait’s total production capacity currently stands at 3.15 million barrels of crude from wholly owned fields, but plans are to boost this to 4 million bpd by 2020 and 4.75 million bpd by 2040.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Kuwait-Oil-Production-Hits-18-Month-High.html,"Aug 01, 2018 at 11:09 | Irina Slav","Aug 01, 2018",Kuwait Oil Production Hits 18-Month High
2018-08-01,"After yet another surprise report—this time of an inventory build—from the American Petroleum Institute weighed on prices yesterday, the Energy Information Administration confirmed a build, reporting U.S. crude oil inventories had added 3.8 million barrels last week.At 408.7 million barrels, the EIA said, crude oil inventories were below the five-year seasonal average.Analysts polled by IG Group had expected a slight inventory decline of 200,000 barrels, after the previous week’s major, 6.1-million-barrel draw reported by the EIA.In gasoline, the EIA reported a draw in inventories, at 2.5 million barrels, compared with 2.3 million barrels a week earlier. Gasoline production averaged 10.5 million bpd between July 23 and 27, up slightly on the previous week.In distillates, the agency reported an inventory increase of 3 million barrels. This compares with a draw of 100,000 barrels a week earlier. Refineries produced 5.2 million barrels of distillates daily last week, basically unchanged from a week earlier.The average daily throughput of refineries stood at 17.5 million barrels of crude, almost 200,000 bpd more than in the previous week, with the facilities operating at 96.1 percent of capacity.Production of crude oil is expected to stay at record highs for the time being despite pipeline constraints in the Permian—the top performer in the U.S. oil patch.  Related: An Unexpected Windfall For U.S. SolarPrices, meanwhile, remain volatile. OPEC’s production, according to a Reuters poll, inched up by just 70,000 bpd last month despite assurances that the cartel would be able to quickly ramp up production to make up for any loss of supply from Iran. This pulled oil prices higher this week.On the other hand, another poll suggested the United States and OPEC together would be able to offset the decline in supply and satisfy growing demand in Asia. Prices, according to this poll, will average US$67.32 per barrel for WTI this year, and US$72.87 per barrel for Brent crude.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Fall-After-EIA-Confirms-Crude-Inventory-Build.html,"Aug 01, 2018 at 09:49 | Irina Slav","Aug 01, 2018",Oil Prices Fall After EIA Confirms Crude Inventory Build
