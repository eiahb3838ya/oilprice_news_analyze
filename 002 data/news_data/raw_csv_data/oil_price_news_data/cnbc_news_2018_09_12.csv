2018-09-12,"China concluded the first physical settlement of the Shanghai crude futures contract (SC crude contract) on September 7, 2018, indicating that the newly launched contract has undergone all the trading processes, the Shanghai Futures Exchange said on its official website on September 10.A total of 601,000 barrels was delivered via the first front-month crude contract on the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), a branch of the Shanghai Futures Exchange, at a settlement price of CNY488.2/bbl ($71.57/bbl). The total value reached CNY293 million on a unilateral basis.SC crude futures will better serve the physical marketThe successful delivery indicates that the Chinese crude futures have passed the market test and are well accepted among industrial participants. It provides a reliable reference for the forthcoming contracts to keep liquid and develop, and will attract more industrial participants, ranging from oil companies and refiners to traders, to use the financial tool to lock in prices for their future physical cargoes.The delivery process, as an important link between futures and spot cargoes, helps realize the convergence of futures prices and spot prices. The smooth process had set a good example to the subsequent contract trading, participants in the delivery commented.Some state-run oil companies were heard to have signed long-term crude contracts with overseas suppliers, priced against SC crude futures and in renminbi. The SC crude futures have already begun to reflect physical supply and demand fundamentals and are expected to better serve the real economy.SC crude futures are gaining momentumThe SC crude futures have already showed strong development momentum though it is only five months since the launch.As of August 31, INE crude contracts had recorded a total trading volume of 11.09 million lots, valued at CNY 5.39 trillion, and an average daily position of 14,800 lots, replacing DME Oman crude futures as the world’s third largest crude futures contract.  Related: Tariff Threats Aren’t Impacting China’s LNG DemandWhile keeping a good correlation with international crude futures, China’s crude futures can independently mirror supply and demand in the Asia-Pacific market. There was once a whopping spread of $5/bbl between SC crude futures and DME Oman crude futures, opening a modest arbitrage window. Some participants took the chance to apply for approval for cargo delivery into INE-designated storage tanks from the exchange and got ready to deliver physical cargoes via the SC crude contract, which market sources see as the most direct and effective response to SC crude futures.SC crude futures are attracting more participationOver 30,000 participants have so far opened an account on the INE platform for crude futures trading. Over ten large domestic and overseas oil companies and traders started their trading on the launch day alone.Financial institutions including securities, fund management companies and trust companies take up 15% of all the participants, indicating robust demand from the enterprise asset management sector.Overseas participants are watching closely on the Chinese crude futures, and multiple oil companies, traders, financial institutions alike from Singapore, the UK, the US, etc. have already participated in trading the contract. Currently, about 15 percent of the positions are held by overseas participants, versus 5 percent over the first two trading months.Moreover, international institutions such as the International Energy Agency and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have also contributed objective analysis of China’s crude futures.While the SC futures contract is making a name for itself in oil markets, there is still a long way to go for Shanghai crude futures to compete with the world’s top two benchmarks, NYMEX WTI and ICE Brent.By JLCMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/China-Completes-First-Physical-Delivery-For-Crude-Futures.html,"Sep 12, 2018 at 11:46 | JLC ","Sep 12, 2018",China Completes First Physical Delivery For Crude Futures
2018-09-12,"Amid fears of global oil supply disruption and production curbs, in its latest monthly report, OPEC expects global oil supplies to remain stable, while cautioning that demand is becoming a growing concern.In the latest report, OPEC said that preliminary data suggested that the global oil supply increased 490,000 barrels a day to average 98.9 mb/d in August, compared with the previous month.OPEC projects that in 2018, non-OPEC oil supply will grow by 2.02 mmb/d despite making a downward revision of 64,000 b/d from its last report. In 2019, non-OPEC oil supply is expected to grow by another 2.15 mb/d, an upward revision of 17,000 b/d. Meanwhile, OPEC's supply is also rising.According to secondary sources total crude oil production by OPEC members averaged 32.56 mb/d in August, an increase of 278,000 b/d over the previous month. As shown in the table below, oil output increased mostly in Libya, Iraq and Nigeria, while production declined in Iran, which is due to be hit with sanctions on its oil industry from November onwards, Venezuela, which is experiencing economic and political upheavals depressing production, and Algeria.(Click to enlarge) Meanwhile, oil production by OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia rose by 38kb/d to 10.4 million barrels daily, ticking up every month since May, when it and Russia signaled that they could increase output to fill any supply shortages due to incoming U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil industry.One curious divergence: according to secondary sources, Iran's oil supply production fell by 150,000 barrels a day from July to August to around 3.5 mb/d. But according to Iran's own reporting, production was stable and unchanged production figures for the last three months, however, of 3.8 mb/d.(Click to enlarge) But while OPEC sees supply as stable, some clouds emerged on the demand side, where OPEC expects that in 2018 global oil demand is expected to grow by 1.62 million barrels a day, a minor downward revision from last month's projection.""World oil demand growth in 2018 was revised downward by around 20,000 b/d, primarily as a result of the slower-than-expected performance by non-OECD Latin America and the Middle East during the second quarter of 2018"" OPEC said. ""Hence, world oil demand growth is now pegged at 1.62 mb/d for 2018, with total global consumption at 98.82 mb/d.""  Related: The Downside For Oil Is LimitedOPEC revised world oil demand growth lower for 2019 as well.""In 2019, world oil demand growth was revised slightly lower by 20,000 from the previous month's report, primarily as a result of economic revisions to Latin America and the Middle East. World oil demand growth is now anticipated at 1.41 mb/d and total global consumption at around 100.23 mb/d.""What is becoming a growing demand-side concern to the oil market are fears that punitive U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports could weaken demand the country's demand for oil. Looking at the global oil trade, OPEC noted that while China's crude oil imports dropped in July by 70,000 barrels a day from the previous month to average 8.62 mb/d, based on an annual comparison, China's crude imports were still higher by 420,000 b/d in August, or 5 percent higher from a year ago.As a result, demand for oil from the 15-member producing group OPEC is expected to fall the rest of 2018 and into 2019, OPEC said. In 2018, demand for OPEC crude is expected at 32.9 million barrels a day (mb/d), which is 500,000 barrels a day lower than in the previous year, the organization said.OPEC forecasts that demand for its crude at 32.1 mb/d in 2019, around 900,000 b/d lower than a year earlier. Yet, as CNBC notes, total world oil demand in 2019 is now projected to surpass 100 mb/d for the first time and reach 100.23 mb/d.By Zerohedge.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-OPEC-Is-Concerned-About-Global-Demand-Growth.html,"Sep 12, 2018 at 11:07 | ZeroHedge ","Sep 12, 2018",Why OPEC Is Concerned About Global Demand Growth
2018-09-12,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute gave oil bulls a cause for celebration with an estimated 8.636-million-barrel inventory decline for the week to September 7, the Energy Information Administration added to the optimism by reporting a draw of 5.3 million barrels.At 396.2 million barrels, the authority said, crude oil inventories were within seasonal limits.Refineries processed 17.9 million barrels daily last week, the EIA also said, producing 10.4 million bpd of gasoline and 5.5 million bpd of distillate. This compares with 10.2 million bpd of gasoline a week earlier, and 5.4 million bpd of distillate.Gasoline inventories added 1.3 million barrels in the week to September 7, and distillate inventories rose by 6.2 million barrels. A week earlier, gasoline inventories gained 1.8 million barrels and distillate inventories added 3.1 million barrels.More fuel inventory builds are on the way as refineries begin maintenance season ahead of winter, and crude oil stockpiles will likely rise as well: winter is a season of weaker oil demand in the northern hemisphere.Meanwhile, prices remain on the seesaw ahead of the Iran sanction due to kick in on November 4. Washington has signaled it was unwilling to grant sanction waivers even to allies such as India, while Iran has given the European Union until November 5 to come up with practical guarantees it will continue buying Iranian crude.While traders worry about where prices are heading, Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak earlier today offered some more optimism for those interested in prices staying where they are. He said he saw on danger of an oil supply shortage despite the sanctions, but added that OPEC and Russia had enough spare capacity to use if the danger of a shortage reared its head.Novak is meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry tomorrow in Moscow. The agenda will likely include oil prices and potential cooperation between Moscow and Washington to keep these stable.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Rally-On-Significant-Crude-Draw.html,"Sep 12, 2018 at 09:47 | Irina Slav","Sep 12, 2018",Oil Prices Rally On Significant Crude Draw
2018-09-12,"Saudi Arabia has the chance to regain Asian market share after at least three North Asian refiners have asked to receive extra supplies of Saudi oil for October as they are concerned that the returning U.S. sanctions on Iran will limit supply just as winter demand begins, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing sources.Saudi Arabia cut last week its official selling price (OSP) for its flagship Arab Light grade for October to Asia by US$0.10 a barrel to US$1.10 a barrel premium to the Dubai/Oman average.The Saudi move was aimed at enticing more buyers in the month immediately preceding the return of the sanctions on its arch foe Iran, whose shipments to Asia have started to decline and are expected to further drop.The Saudi oil is also currently competitive in Asia because of strong Brent Crude prices that are used for the pricing of supply from Europe and Africa to Asia. In addition, the U.S.-China trade war and the potential tariff on U.S. oil imports makes China’s smaller independent refiners shy away from American crude, according to a monthly survey for August by S&P Global Platts.While Saudi Arabia is poised to boost supplies to Asia, Iran’s sales in the world’s fastest-growing oil-importing region have started to drop.Iran’s key customers in Asia—no.1 China and no.2 India—are not expected to cut off their imports of Iranian oil, although India may reduce some of its Iranian intake as it tries to maneuver between cheap Iranian crude and the U.S. pressure to have Iran’s oil exports down to ‘zero’.Related: OPEC Outages Are Driving Up Oil PricesChina has said that it would not stop buying Iranian oil, but Beijing is also said to have agreed not to increase its oil purchases from Iran.Major Japanese refiners were said last week to have officially notified Iran that they would halt all imports of Iranian oil for October while they wait for the Japan-U.S. talks on Iranian oil imports to make a permanent decision on how to proceed in November. U.S. ally South Korea did not import any Iranian oil in August, compared to 194,000 bpd imports from Iran in July, according to tanker-tracking and shipping data compiled by Bloomberg. South Korea says that it continues talks with the United States for a possible waiver.
