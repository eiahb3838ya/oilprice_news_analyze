2018-04-20,"Oil has rallied sharply in recent days to see West Texas Intermediate (WTI) trading at just under $70 per barrel and Brent breaking through the $70 per barrel mark, with crude trading at its highest price since 2014. The surge in oil can be directly attributed to a wide variety of geopolitical risks which are sparking considerable fears that global oil supplies could be sharply constrained in coming months.  This has triggered considerable speculation that $100 per barrel is on its way.According to some pundits, the bearish factors which have weighed on oil prices for some time have been priced in by the market.Nonetheless, the perception of geopolitical risk and how it is driving oil higher appears to be overbaked and there are a range of threats to the $100 per barrel oil narrative. Key is that U.S. oil production is expanding at a rapid clip. The U.S. EIA recently estimated that domestic production had hit 10,500 barrels daily, its highest level since starting to provide this data in the early 80s. The International Energy Agency (IEA) believes that the U.S. will overtake Russia to become the world’s largest oil producer by 2019.The big question is whether this along with a marked expansion in the volume of U.S. drilled but uncompleted wells (DUCs) and rig count, which in early April 2018 reached its highest point in three years, is enough to suppress prices. The answer could surprise investors because fundamentals indicate that higher oil is here to stay, for as long as Saudi Arabia and Russia don’t aggressively unwind the production caps established in November 2016.This is contrary to the thoughts of some analysts including those at Barclays who believe that oil will weaken once again to $51 per barrel during the second-half of 2018. What many analysts who are betting on lower oil are discounting is the effect of stronger global economic growth on the demand for energy. World gross domestic product (GDP) has been forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for 2018 to expand at 3.9 percent which is 10 basis points higher than the 3.8 percent projected for 2017.Emerging markets are also surging with many expected to post significant growth in 2017. When those factors coupled with the improved U.S. economic outlook led by Trump’s corporate tax reform are considered it is likely that the global GDP will expand at a greater than the 3.9 percent projected. That will fuel even greater demand growth for oil.Already, the IEA has revised its 2018 estimates many times. At its last revision in mid-March 2018, the IEA estimated that demand growth would top 1.5 million barrels daily for the year, which is 200,000 barrels higher than its earlier forecast. There is every sign that the global economic upswing which is underway will boost demand even higher.Related: IMF: Expect Oil To Fall Below $60You only need to consider that in 2017 when global GDP expanded by 3.8 percent, which is 10-bps lower than the 3.9 percent forecast for 2018, global energy demand for the year grew by 2.1 percent or double 2016.  OPEC has forecast demand growth for the year of over 1.6 million barrels daily while the U.S. EIA is predicting that it will be even higher at 1.8 million barrels. The upper end of those later forecasts appears more realistic than the 1.5 million barrels predicted by the IEA.When you add in growing Middle East tensions, volatile security conditions in Nigeria and Libya, Trump’s push to tear-up the nuclear deal with Iran and Venezuela’s oil industry descending into freefall there is every risk of a significant supply outage being triggered by geopolitical risks. It is likely that with Venezuela’s production deteriorating at a greater clip than has been priced in by markets, this along with Trump pushing to reinstate sanctions against Iran could wipe more than 500,000 barrels daily off global supplies.That could certainly push Brent to the $80 per barrel mark or higher, which appears to be Saudi Arabia’s desired price.However, it is questionable whether those unexpected supply constraints working with rising demand growth would be enough to push oil to $100, primarily because the rapid growth in U.S. oil output could meet some of that demand.What is becoming clear is that a range of supply-side factors including geopolitical threats along with stronger than anticipated economic growth driving greater demand for oil, means that the higher oil narrative has some way to playout. That combined with Saudi Arabia flagging that it intends to continue cooperating with Russia on production caps will prevent global oil markets from tipping into oversupply as some analysts’ claim will occur in late 2018.By Mathew Smith for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Will-US-Shale-Offset-Soaring-Global-Oil-Demand.html,"Apr 20, 2018 at 18:06 | Matthew Smith","Apr 20, 2018",Will U.S. Shale Offset Soaring Global Oil Demand?
2018-04-20,"ConocoPhillips is coming off of an incredible exploration season, reportedly the best they’ve had in over a decade, and they have Alaskan oil to thank for it. The company stuck big in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) this winter, successfully finding oil at all six of their test wells (three exploration and three appraisal), which means chances are good that the trans-Alaska pipeline system could soon be seeing a lot more (much-needed) action.The Houston-based supermajor has estimated that there are at least 300 million barrels of recoverable oil in its  ""Willow Discovery"" along Alaska's Western North Slope, and these appraisal wells seem to strongly support that projection. More importantly, this discovery could represent just a fraction of the available reserves along the North Slope, and ConocoPhillips plans to keep exploring the area over another busy exploration season next year, starting with a recent $400 million deal to buy all of Anadarko Petroleum Corp.’s North Slope assets.Over the next five years, it is projected that ConocoPhillips will be adding 100,000 barrels a day to the trans-Alaska pipeline for a total 650,000 barrels a day, an 18 percent increase. This is great news after years of dwindling volumes--to put today’s 550,000 barrels per day in perspective, when the pipeline peaked in 1988 it was funneling  2.1 million barrels of oil per day through Alaska, an economy that relies heavily on oil revenues but has been seeing volatile returns in the past years.ConocoPhillips’ “Willow Discovery” is also a glimmer of hope for Alaska’s long-suffering North Slope. Once the powerhouse of the country, many of its once-abundant fields have been sucked dry. Onetime major fields like Prudhoe Bay, the Kuparuk River and the Alpine are now nearly tapped. Now companies like ConocoPhillips are breathing new life into the region, picking up speed since several major oil fields were discovered there over the past few years.Related: Is Saudi Arabia Losing Its Asian Oil Market Share?The newfound interest in Alaskan oil is not limited to ConocoPhillips, however. Investors and developers from as far-flung places as Papua New Guinea (PNG) have moved in to get a piece of the action. Last month a PNG-based company called Oil Search took over operations with a $400 million stake in the Nanushuk field. The field is part of the massive Pikka unit, reportedly the state’s third largest with an estimated volume of 1.2 billion barrels of oil (some sources have even reported up to 3 billion barrels). Oil Search bought a large stake in the field from Denver-based Armstrong Oil and Gas, while Spanish-based Repsol owns another significant portion.Alaska’s State Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Andy Mack told the Associated Press saying that Pikka alone could reverse the extended decline in the trans-Alaska pipeline. Oil Search is equally bullish about the prospects, saying that the first planned development could account for an investment in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion, with a goal to have their oil flowing through the trans-Alaska pipeline by 2023.Related: A Natural Gas Giant Like No OtherNow, the Trump administration is pushing ahead with legislation that will allow drilling in the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, with a 60-day review to sell oil and gas leases in the pristine 19.6-million acre region. A divisive issue to say the least, the fate of the region has been bounced back and forth between political platforms since the Clinton administration, and critics point out the delicacy of the region and the threat drilling would pose to its population of migratory birds and the caribou on which the indigenous Gwich’in people depend.The Alaskan government, however is likely extremely please, after fighting to open the refuge for years for their state which heavily depends on the wellbeing of the oil industry. In fact, the good news just keeps piling up for Alaskan oil after years of oil debts and economic decline. While not everyone is thrilled about the prospect of Big Oil’s comeback in Alaska, few can deny that the winds of change are about to blow in a lot of cash.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-New-Alaskan-Oil-Rush.html,"Apr 20, 2018 at 18:06 | Haley Zaremba","Apr 20, 2018",The New Alaskan Oil Rush
2018-04-20,"The rapid growth of the renewable energy sector has been astonishing.Renewables have been the fastest-growing sources of energy worldwide – and we’re seeing solar power coming in first as the fastest-growing source altogether.Tech companies in particular have been embracing this “Renewable Revolution,” but it’s not just Silicon Valley that’s heading into this territory.Big businesses like Starbucks and Target have been getting in on it as well, who have each announced aggressive targets to run 100 percent of its global operations with renewable energy.In the midst of an energy revolution like this one, it’s easy to miss the subtleties involved in making it happen.And there is one simple reason as to why renewables are surging…Deep in Oil Territory, Renewables are BoomingBoth solar and wind continue to decline in operating costs, while increasing in energy efficiency. The combination is making it difficult for coal to recover and poses a challenge in what had been oil-dominant areas.Take West Texas, for example.The Permian Basin, which straddles Texas and New Mexico, continues to be one of the most prolific drilling locations in the country.Here, operating costs as compared to wellhead prices (the below-market price producers actually receive for the volume coming out of the ground) make for some profitable fields even at low oil prices.Yet the same location has also become the largest in the country for wind power.Fact is, even this deep in oil country, Texas produces more wind energy than the next three states combined.Related: Is Saudi Arabia Losing Its Asian Oil Market Share?Currently, the “Lone Star State” accounts for nearly a fourth of the nation’s wind power capacity, and current wind projects have the capacity to generate over 20,000 megawatts (MW) of power.That’s enough to power more than 5 million homes.In both solar and wind, the assumption not long ago was that once government subsidies had been phased out, a ceiling would form on additional renewable power production.However, this argument in favor of a return to dominance for traditional energy sources failed to consider one salient point…A Cheaper Energy SourceSolar and wind have become far cheaper to produce than even their strongest adherents had expected. That means they have both reached and exceeded “grid parity” – their generating costs being equal or lower than those of natural gas and even coal.Yes, nuclear remains the cheapest way to produce electricity.But the high costs of constructing nuclear power plants and the still long delays in approval and finishing the plants have propelled renewables into an ascendancy in the non-fossil fuel category.Crude oil hardly figures into the electricity-generation equation in the U.S.And until the next massive wave switch in vehicle engines – electric, hybrid, CNG (compressed natural gas), and LNG (liquefied natural gas) – distillates (gasoline and diesel) will have the lion share of the transport fuel market.Which means that on the electricity production front, this has become a competition between coal and natural gas on the one hand, and renewables (solar and wind, with a marginal presence of biofuel and geothermal) on the other.Now, natural gas production in the U.S. would seem to have been given a boost by the Trump Administration’s support for hydrocarbons. The problem has been a persistent surplus of production, combined with a penchant by Mother Nature to produce mellower than expected temperatures, which drives down air conditioning use and thus power demand.Related: Can Saudi Arabia Afford Its Megaprojects?The latter is likely to change as we move into summer and hotter temperatures.But the bottom line remains the same.The New Energy Powerhouse is HereSolar and wind have become far more competitive and have in some cases – West Texas (wind) and the Southwest (solar), for example – emerged as the preferable move.All of which has set the stage for a very different scenario following the D.C. decision to make the U.S. one of only three nations opposed to the Paris Climate Accord.Even then, that number is misleading, since Nicaragua largely opposes the agreement because it did not go far enough in combatting climate change.That leaves just the U.S. and Syria, of all places.Yet here is the interesting matter.Despite the elimination of government support and new management at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) bent on resurrecting coal, solar and wind continue to undercut the cost of increasing reliance on hydrocarbons.Put simply, renewables are progressively becoming the energy “currency of choice” regardless of what exercise in political dominoes the Administration had in mind.And consider this…Solar and wind employees total nearly 800,000 in the domestic workforce – a figure likely to be doubled by 2020.Meanwhile, U.S. coal jobs have dwindled to 160,000, less than a quarter as the renewable energy sector, and will decline even further by the end of the decade.Regardless of the short-term electoral machinations practiced in the White House, the market itself is making its own decision.While there will remain a position for coal in the developing energy balance, it’s not going to return to its dominance of last century.And King Coal will have to give up his throne to a new ruler in the energy world.By Dr. Kent MoorsMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Renewables-Are-Booming-In-Oil-Country.html,"Apr 20, 2018 at 18:06 | Kent Moors","Apr 20, 2018",Renewables Are Booming In Oil Country
