2018-06-05,"The Trump administration has sent a request to Saudi Arabia for it and the rest of OPEC to boost oil production by 1 million barrels per day (mb/d), according to a Bloomberg report.It wasn’t the first time that the U.S. has asked Saudi Arabia to ratchet up supply in an effort to relieve high prices. Former President George W. Bush pressed the Saudis to increase output in early 2008, just ahead of the historic run up in prices. His pleas, which persisted in the first half of the year as oil prices continued to rise, were rebuffed by Saudi Arabia. A few months later, the financial crisis helped resolve the problem of expensive oil.In 2012, the Obama administration asked Saudi Arabia to increase production after an international coalition slapped sanctions on Iran, which cut down Iranian oil exports by about 1 mb/d.Now, the U.S. finds itself in a similar situation as it did six years ago. Oil prices climbed to multi-year highs and sanctions on Iran threaten to push prices even higher. However, what is a bit more unusual from the U.S. government’s request this time around is the Trump administration apparently has a specific figure in mind – the Saudis and OPEC should increase output by 1 mb/d, the U.S. said, according to Bloomberg. To be sure, Reuters reported that the U.S. did not request a specific figure.Either way, in a departure from the past, OPEC seems to be more amenable to American appeals for higher output. The cartel’s Secretary-General said a few weeks ago that the tweet from President Trump in April influenced their calculations, and they felt they needed to prevent prices from rising too much.  Related: Oil Sinks Deeper On OPEC ConcernsAnd comments from Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin in May suggested that the U.S. and Saudi Arabia had at least discussed the possibility in the context of the U.S. pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal. Mnuchin said that ""various conversations with various parties about different parties that would be willing to increase oil supply to offset"" the losses of Iranian supply. A bit of a word salad, but Mnuchin was likely telegraphing the willingness of Saudi Arabia to increase supply.OPEC officials huddled in Kuwait just a few days ago, trying to hash out a strategy ahead of the June 22 meeting. OPEC officials were tight-lipped about what was discussed, but they promised to “ensure stable oil supplies are made available in a timely manner to meet growing demand and offset declines in some parts of the world.” The boilerplate statement could be interpreted as a willingness to increase output this year, ahead of schedule, but it was likely intentional that the statement was left so vague.Despite all the jockeying behind closed doors, a series of public comments from the Saudi and Russian energy ministers suggest that the two largest producers in the OPEC+ group will likely agree to increase production in two weeks’ time, although the specifics still need to be hammered out. Russia is aiming for a larger increase in supply, perhaps around 1 mb/d. Saudi Arabia wants something much more modest.There are a few reasons why OPEC might be more sensitive to the wishes of the U.S. government than they were in the past. For one, the Trump administration has been very explicit about its support for Riyadh, and hasn’t expressed any concern about human rights, or the war in Yemen, or other issues that might irk the Saudi government. Trump is also much more aggressive towards Iran than the Obama administration, something that goes down well with the Saudi regime.Moreover, the Saudi government, led by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, is more bellicose than it used to be. MbS, as he is known, has waged an aggressive foreign policy, and is itching for a fight with Iran. The Saudis need the U.S. on board with that campaign, so placating Washington with cheaper gasoline prices is a small price to pay.  Related: New Iraqi Lawmakers Want Out Of OPEC DealHowever, unlike the past, the biggest difference arguably comes from the oil market itself. A decade ago, when President Bush asked for help, Saudi Arabia saw little downside in snubbing him. The U.S. was hopelessly addicted to oil, and had no way to avoid paying high prices. While that addiction has changed only marginally in the intervening years, the difference between then and now is that Saudi Arabia has to worry about losing market share to U.S. shale drillers.The “Saudi vs. U.S. shale” narrative is a bit overblown in the media, but the fact of the matter is that OPEC runs the risk of sparking too much high-cost supply if it lets prices rise too far. In years past, $100 oil would stimulate new investment, but those projects would take years to come online. Short lead times for shale, however, have sped up the price cycles, so the risk is that high prices will lead to a wave of new supply, which crash prices again in short order. Indeed, U.S. shale has already grown rapidly over the past few quarters.In short, Saudi Arabia looks ready to increase production, but it has a variety of reasons why it could agree to do so. It isn’t just that Riyadh is complying with a specific demand from the U.S. government.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Will-Saudi-Arabia-Listen-To-US-Demands-For-More-Oil.html,"Jun 05, 2018 at 17:12 | Nick Cunningham","Jun 05, 2018",Will Saudi Arabia Listen To U.S. Demands For More Oil?
2018-06-05,"We are living in a carbon bubble with trillions of dollars held in oil, gas, and coal assets that would be wiped out before long as technological advancements in all sorts of industries quickly undermine fossil fuel demand.This is the gist of a recent study led by the University of Cambridge, which involved macroeconomic simulations, with the researchers concluding we are on the brink of a much worse financial crisis than the one from 2008 as between 1 and 3 trillion worth of fossil fuel investments turn into stranded assets. For context, the authors note that the 2008 crisis was sparked by losses to the tune of US$250 billion.The fast pace of technological progress in renewable energy and elsewhere that is producing higher levels of energy efficiency is the driver of the crisis. To avoid it, the study authors say, the world needs to deflate the bubble carefully before it bursts. Otherwise we might see a global crisis compared to which the Great Recession was a picnic.The researchers ran repeated simulations with different scenarios as researchers tend to do in such studies and concluded that the worst case would be continued fossil fuel production in the context of falling demand, which is actually a conclusion one doesn’t need macroeconomic simulations to make.“If OPEC nations maintain production levels as prices drop, they will crowd out the market,” says one of the authors, Hector Pollitt from Cambridge Econometrics and EENRG. “OPEC nations will be the only ones able to produce fossil fuels at the low costs required, and exporters such as the US and Canada will be unable to compete.”  Related: Oil Sinks Deeper On OPEC ConcernsBut this will be just the start. As demand declines, by 2035 oil—and other fossil fuels—will sell so cheap that even large, low-cost producers will not be able to enjoy their revenues. Social and political tumult could ensue as jobs are lost and disgruntlement grows. Ironically, the push for more and stricter climate change policies will only aggravate the situation, unless it is accompanied by parallel action in fossil fuels, namely, winding down investments in their production.This sounds decidedly questionable when you compare it with warnings from, say, OPEC’s secretary-general Mohammed Barkindo that oil prices could soar unless more money is spent on new production, but the researchers are not the only ones sounding the energy efficiency alarm.A recent report from Norwegian quality assurance and risk management provider DNV.GL has forecast that global energy demand could plateau by 2050 thanks to energy efficiency improvements. The firm goes as far as to say that the world economy’s energy intensity will decline faster than the economy grows over the next 30 years.  Related: New Iraqi Lawmakers Want Out Of OPEC DealThe gains in energy efficiency, DNV.GL says, will in fact contribute a lot more to the energy transition that the world is undergoing than solar, wind, and electric vehicles taken together. At an average energy efficiency improvement rate of 2.5 percent annually until 2050, it is the single most important factor that could bring the world closer to meeting the Paris Agreement targets.Energy efficiency and the technologies behind it don’t get as much headlines as solar, wind, or especially EVs. But it may turn out that it is, as the Norwegian firm calls it, the unsung hero of the energy transition.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/New-Technology-Could-Wipe-Out-Trillions-in-Fossil-Fuel-Investment.html,"Jun 05, 2018 at 16:58 | Irina Slav","Jun 05, 2018",New Technology Could Wipe Out Trillions In Fossil Fuel Investment
2018-06-05,"Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA has told eight foreign clients it will be unable to supply the contracted volumes of crude oil, a company employee told S&P Platts.""Among the affected clients due to the low availability of crude to export are Nynas, Tipco, Chevron, CNPC, Reliance, Conoco, Valero, and Lukoil, which will partially receive the volumes established by the contracts,"" the person said.The amount the company will not be able to supply is close to half of the total committed volumes of this grade, Merey 16, for June. It only has 578,000 bpd of the grade available, while the total contracted volume is 1.271 million barrels daily. PDVSA’s total crude commitments for the month stand at 1.495 million bpd, but it only has 694,000 bpd available.Plagued by mismanagement, corruption, and most recently a lack of investment money under the double weight of U.S. sanctions and lower oil prices, PDVSA has seen its production plummet over the last couple of years. S&P Platts estimates this plunge has wiped out as much as 900,000 bpd from the company’s daily production, with the latest daily average standing at 1.41 million bpd in April.Earlier this month, an executive from India’s largest oil company, ONGC, said that PDVSA owes it US$444 million in payments due under a joint project between the state company and the overseas division of ONGC, OVL.

According to OVL, Venezuela’s PDVSA has not paid dividends from the project to the Indian firm between 2009 and 2013, while no dividends have been declared after that.Meanwhile, collapsing Venezuela has reportedly offered India a 30-percent discount on crude oil purchases, but only if India agrees to pay in El Petro.

2018-06-05,"The United States has quietly asked Saudi Arabia and several other OPEC nations to raise oil production by some 1 million bpd, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, quoting people familiar with the matter.While the U.S. government has often expressed opinion against OPEC’s oil price-fixing policies—including a recent comment by President Trump, asking for a specific amount of oil production boost is a rare move, Bloomberg’s sources noted.It’s not clear how the U.S. request has been conveyed, and the White House declined to comment on conversations. Yet, a spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council told Bloomberg:“We welcome any market-based action that increases energy access and fosters a healthy global economy.”Back in April, when oil prices hit a three-and-a-half year highs, U.S. President Donald Trump slammed OPEC for manipulating oil prices in a tweet saying that oil prices were “artificially very high” and “will not be accepted.”“Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” President Trump said on Twitter on April 20.Oil prices then further jumped in May after the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iran that will kick in later this year.  Related: Shale Bottlenecks Could Send Oil Prices HigherConcerns over a potential loss of some of Iran’s oil exports and the collapsing Venezuelan production supported an oil price rally for most of May, until reports emerged at the end of last month that OPEC’s largest producer Saudi Arabia and its key non-OPEC partner in the production cut deal, Russia, were discussing lifting the combined oil production of the countries from the pact by some 1 million bpd, potentially easing the cuts in response to supply concerns amid rising oil prices.OPEC, and Saudi Arabia specifically, have assured in recent weeks that they would address “consumer and market anxiety” if need be, as gasoline prices around the world reached their highest in four years.In the United States, national average gasoline prices approached $3 per gallon ahead of Memorial Day weekend, the highest price ahead of the Memorial Day weekend since 2014, the EIA says, and expects regular gasoline prices during the summer season—April through September—to average $2.90 a gallon this year, which would be 49 cents higher than last summer.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.com",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Asks-OPEC-To-Boost-Oil-Production-By-1-Million-Bpd.html,"Jun 05, 2018 at 08:59 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jun 05, 2018",U.S. Asks OPEC To Boost Oil Production By 1 Million Bpd
