2018-04-06,"The Permian basin is driving U.S. shale growth, with expectations that the basin will add enormous volumes this year, keeping the oil market well-supplied. But the Permian’s pipeline network is already filling up, forcing steep discounts for oil, and threatening to derail the aggressive growth projections for the region.The EIA predicts the Permian will hit 3.156 million barrels per day (mb/d) of output in April, an increase of 80,000 bpd from March, and up a shocking 850,000 bpd from a year ago. Shale E&Ps and the oil majors are pouring in billions of dollars into the region, and two out of every three rigs the industry is adding is going into the Permian.But the shale basin is getting crowded, which not only means skyrocketing prices for land and a search for opportunities along the periphery, but also rapidly shrinking availability on the Permian’s pipeline network. “As these fringe areas begin to get exploited, we are seeing more and more crude that needs to find a pipeline to Cushing or the Gulf Coast,” John Zanner, energy analyst for RBN Energy, told Reuters.Oil market analysts knew that new pipeline capacity would be necessary in order to move all of the oil out of the Permian. But few expected the region to run out of pipeline space so quickly.“At the end of 2017, there was just 160 kb/d of line space available out of Western Texas. This small surplus is likely to turn into a deficit in the second half of 2018,” the IEA wrote in its March Oil Market Report. “The pipeline gap could widen further until mid-2019, in turn reducing the price of WTI Midland relative to Cushing.”Related: Oil Prices Poised To Rise As Cycle Comes To An End“Other bottlenecks, such as shortages of sand and labour, as well as mounting demands for investor returns, could also slow growth, but most likely beyond 2018. For now, US producers continue to ramp up activity,” the IEA wrote in its March Oil Market Report.The IEA was spot on, except that the bottleneck the agency predicted is already starting to materialize. Even late last month when the IEA warned about pipeline issues, the thinking was that bottlenecks would start to form in mid-2018.But according to Genscape, and reported on by Reuters, pipeline utilization in the Permian has jumped to 96 percent over the past month. Genscape says the Permian has 3.175 mb/d of pipeline, rail and local refining capacity combined. That’s a problem given that the EIA sees production jumping to 3.156 mb/d in April.That essentially means the pipelines are already close to being completely full, and the prices for oil from the Permian are starting to reflect that problem. Canadian oil producers have been suffering from painful discounts for their oil because of a lack of pipeline capacity, but now the Permian is running into a similar problem. On Wednesday, Midland light sweet crude traded at a $8-per-barrel discount relative to WTI.“What the spreads are telling you is that these pipelines are full going to the Gulf Coast,” Kendrick Rhea at energy consultancy East Daley Capital, told Reuters. The earliest possible relief will come from the Permian Express 3 pipeline, which could add 200,000 bpd of capacity by the end of this year.This is a serious problem for Permian drillers, who could be forced to slow growth or even shut down some operations if things get worse. That could have a significant impact on earnings.Related: Are We Sleepwalking Into The Next Oil Crisis?But there are broader ramifications for the global oil market. The assumption that the oil market would be well-supplied not only this year, but for years to come, is largely predicated on aggressive growth from U.S. shale generally, but also the Permian in particular. If Permian growth comes to a standstill this year, that will completely upend conventional wisdom about adequate supply.“Two opposing forces in the Americas dominate our medium term forecast. In the early years, record-smashing US supply far outweighs collapsing Venezuelan capacity, keeping the world adequately supplied,” the IEA wrote in its Oil 2018 report. The agency expects the U.S. to add 3.7 mb/d over the next five years.The IEA warned about a supply problem in the 2020s. But if the Permian does not add the enormous volumes that everybody thinks it will, the supply problems could arrive sooner than expected. To be sure, a series of pipeline projects could resolve the bottleneck, but several of them are not expected to come online until mid-to-late 2019.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Permian-Bottleneck-Could-Impact-Global-Oil-Markets.html,"Apr 06, 2018 at 17:05 | Nick Cunningham","Apr 06, 2018",Permian Bottleneck Could Impact Global Oil Markets
2018-04-06,"Until a decade ago, most of the world was a captive customer of oil—consumers would pay any price for gasoline and oil demand was soaring regardless of the surging oil prices.But recently, many countries around the world have started to show more sensitivity to oil prices—oil demand grows as their economies grow, but oil demand is also more susceptible to oil price swings, with the oil price-consumption correlation behaving more like an everyday product, according to data by Washington-based ClearView Energy Partners and research by Bloomberg Gadfly columnist Liam Denning.Although it’s at least a decade or more too early to call the end of the world’s oil addiction, the research and data suggest that in a growing number of large oil-consuming economies oil demand now correlates negatively with oil prices. In other words, consumption drops when prices rise and vice versa—a common economic concept applicable to almost every other product on the market.With oil, this has not always been the case.ClearView Energy and Denning analyzed data for three 10-year periods ending in 2006, 2011, and 2016, respectively.During the first 10-year period until 2006, countries comprising four-fifths of oil demand, including the United States, India, China, and Russia, showed a positive correlation between oil demand and their gross domestic product (GDP) and between demand and oil prices. In the decade before the financial crisis in 2007-2008, oil demand soared almost everywhere in the world, despite the fact that oil prices were also rallying. This was the period of Chinese industrialization and construction boom which gobbled up oil at any price. In most of the world, the picture was the same—oil demand rose together with rising economies and with rising oil prices, suggesting that those countries were captive customers of oil.  Related: Oil Prices Bristle As U.S. Rig Count ClimbsThe second 10-year period in the research coincides with the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the recession that followed. During the 10 years through 2011, U.S. oil demand decoupled from American economic growth and started to react to the resurgence of oil prices that began in 2009. In that period, the U.S. shifted away from being a ‘captive’ customer of oil to look more like Germany or Japan, where the link between GDP and oil consumption has weakened. While this was a profound shift in how U.S. oil demand correlated with GDP and oil prices, many of the emerging economies—including the biggest oil demand drivers India and China— still looked like captive customers of oil. Their oil demand was soaring even in periods of oil price spikes, the research and data show.Then, in the third period—the ten years through 2016—even oil demand in China and India looked like more responsive to the prevailing oil prices. In those countries and other developing economies, oil demand growth is still closely connected with the GDP growth. But oil demand has started to show some negative correlation with oil prices, suggesting that consumption is more susceptible to the price of oil than it was in the previous decades. True, the 10-year period until 2016 includes the oil price crash during which the negative correlation was heightened by the fact that demand grew faster because of the low oil prices.  Related: Bahrain Says Giant Discovery Holds 80 Billion Barrels Of OilNevertheless, India and China have now moved into the group of economies that show positive correlation between oil demand and economic growth, and a negative correlation between demand and oil prices. The United States is also in this group, with a weak positive correlation between demand and GDP and with a negative demand/oil price correlation, the research showed.It’s not clear whether the global economies will continue to show a negative correlation between oil demand and oil prices from this point onwards, but the research suggests that in the United States, and even in China and India, oil demand is now more sensitive to oil prices than it was a decade or two ago, and that oil producers may be wrong to think that they still hold captive customers who would buy their product at any price.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Has-The-World-Started-To-Kick-Its-Oil-Addiction.html,"Apr 06, 2018 at 17:05 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Apr 06, 2018",Has The World Started To Kick Its Oil Addiction?
2018-04-06,"2017 trends for UK offshore production were disrupted by the stoppage in the Forties pipeline in December, which took several hundred thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day off line. Overall average oil production for the year dropped 61 kbpd (6.4 percent) and natural gas (including NGPLs) barely changed with an 800 boed drop. With the Forties issue exit rates don’t mean anything, but the running average oil production was on an upward trend in the second half of the year, which will continue through 2018, barring further major outages, while natural gas was noticeably declining and might struggle to maintain 2017s rate this year.2016 reserve numbers fell for both oil and gas with few discoveries and some negative adjustments. Oil and gas production will decline from 2018, with accelerated falls from sometime in the mid-2020s without major new discoveries (which may include onshore shale gas, but that is not covered here).UK C&C",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/UK-Oil-And-Gas-May-Struggle-Without-New-Discoveries.html,"Apr 06, 2018 at 16:51 | Ron Patterson","Apr 06, 2018",UK Oil And Gas May Struggle Without New Discoveries

The oil market is tightening, but trade concerns are dominating headlines.U.S. mulls another $100 billion in tariffs on China. In a rapidly escalating trade war, President Trump called China’s recent tariffs “unfair,” and said he was considering an additional $100 billion in tariffs on China. Trump said that the tariffs on U.S. soy and pork would hurt American farmers, and he instructed the Department of Agriculture to come up with a plant to protect the U.S. agricultural sector. If the administration follows through on the $100 billion in tariffs, China’s Commerce Ministry said it would “follow suit to the end, not hesitate to pay any price, resolutely counterattack and take new comprehensive measures in response.” A wide range of U.S. industries are opposed to the Trump administration’s actions. Dean Garfield, president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a high-tech trade group, called the Trump move “irresponsible and destabilizing,” according to the WSJ.Will energy industry become ensnared in trade war? Crude oil prices sank after each round of tariffs, and while there are real concerns about the ripple effects on demand and global economic growth, it is unclear whether or not the oil and gas relationship will be directly targeted in a major way. China needs the energy, and oil and gas exports have succeeded in cutting the U.S. trade deficit, a particularly concerning metric for the Trump administration. Some analysts think U.S. oil and gas exports to China are too important for both countries. But not everyone agrees. “China can ditch American energy at any time because there’s plenty of supplies elsewhere, whereas for the U.S., energy is a sensitive subject,” Will Yun, a commodities analyst at Hyundai Futures Corp. told Blomberg. “If China shows its willingness to impose tariffs on crude, it will send a shock wave through markets,” said Min Byungkyu, a global strategist at Yuanta Securities Co.

The UK’s North Sea, offshore Mexico and shallow water Norway are some of the most competitive locations for new oil and gas projects, according to Wood Mackenzie. Cost-cutting has lowered breakeven costs for large-scale projects, and WoodMac says that could pave the way for 30 new FIDs this year for major oil and gas projects. The average breakeven price would be $44 per barrel of oil equivalent.Permian hitting pipeline bottlenecks. Permian oil prices are starting to suffer from discounts because the capacity of the region’s pipelines is starting to max out. Production is growing so quickly that the region is running into a pipeline shortage. According to Genscape, pipeline utilization has reached 96 percent in the last four weeks. There are pipeline projects in the works to expand takeaway volumes, but it will take time for those pipelines to come online. The shortage might force producers to slow or even stop production at some point.Cyberattacks hit pipelines. A series of cyberattacks have struck U.S. oil and gas pipelines in the past week, forcing several of them to temporarily shut down. A cyber-attack affected the operations of Oneok (NYSE: OKE), which runs gas pipelines in the Permian and Rocky Mountains. There were several other incidents days earlier. Bloomberg reports that Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE: ETP), Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP (NYSE: BWP), and Chesapeake Utilities Corp.’s (NYSE: CPK) Eastern Shore Natural Gas all reported breakdowns in communications. The attacks hit a third party electronic data interchange (EDI) platform, not the pipeline operations themselves.Tesla under fire, but jumps to #1 in EV sales. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) sold 8,180 Model 3s in the first quarter, more EVs than any other automaker. Elon Musk has been under fire in recent weeks as Tesla’s financial and manufacturing problems have mounted. But the first quarter figures provided some breathing room as they were seen as trending in the right direction. “Good enough,” wrote Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Ben Kallo.U.S. refiners diversify away from Venezuelan oil. Venezuelan oil exports to the U.S. have plummeted over the past year, falling to just 438,000 bpd in January, down to about a third of the typical level from a decade ago. Still, a handful of Gulf Coast refiners have depended on Venezuelan oil, a vulnerability as the U.S. government considers sanctions. S&P Global Platts reports that some Gulf Coast refiners have begun switching over to blends from Colombia, Iraq and even Chad. ""All of these refiners, and the others that import Venezuelan crude, have actively developed plans in case sanctions are enacted,"" said John Auers, executive vice president of Turner, Mason & Company. One reason that Washington has hesitated at tougher sanctions on Venezuela is because of a reluctance to damage U.S.-based refiners. The fuel switching might give more leeway for U.S. sanctions.Related: Oil Prices Poised To Rise As Cycle Comes To An EndScandals mount for EPA chief. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt has faced a barrage of negative media this week, detailing a litany of scandals that threaten his tenure at the agency. Inappropriate spending on furniture and first-class travel; demoting staff for questioning his spending habits; and renting a house from an energy lobbyist – these issues have apparently angered the White House. Pruitt has arguably succeeded more in his mission than any other cabinet official, which could yet keep him on board. But there are rumors the White House is considering sacking him.Solar installations grew faster than fossil fuels in 2017. Last year, for the first time, global solar capacity grew faster than fossil fuels for the first time. Renewable energy accounted for three-fifths of total net power capacity growth in 2017. Today, renewables now account for 12 percent of total electricity generation, double the share from 2010. Costs for solar and wind are falling dramatically and are increasingly competitive with coal and gas in much of the world.By Tom Kool for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Collapse-Despite-Strong-Fundamentals.html,"Apr 06, 2018 at 13:58 | Tom Kool","Apr 06, 2018",Oil Prices Collapse Despite Strong Fundamentals
