2018-02-08,"India plans to increase its crude oil refining capacity by 77 percent to 438.65 million tons, or more than 8 million bpd, a government report has revealed. The increase would happen gradually over the next 12 years as Asia’s new powerhouse seeks to satisfy its growing demand for fuel.The report said that the bulk of the capacity boost will come from facilities owned and operated by Reliance Industries, the local heavyweight, and Essar Oil, which Russia’s Rosneft acquired last year.Reliance will start by increasing the capacity of one of its refineries from the current 33 million tons to 63 million tons annually, while Essar Oil will focus on its 20-million-ton Vadinar facility, upgrading its capacity to 45 million tons.Indian Oil Corp will also take part in the undertaking, planning to boost the processing capacity of four refineries from 80.7 million tons annually to 116.55 million tons.The report comes on the heels of a statement from a government official that the country also has plans to triple its LNG imports over the next seven years to 70 million tons annually. Currently, India has a capacity to import 20 million tons, received at four LNG terminals. Until 2024, the government will aim to build another 11 facilities as it seeks to increase the share of natural gas in its energy mix twofold to 15 percent.These will further rise to 15 terminals, Narendra Taneja, spokesman for the ruling BJP party said at an industry event in Indonesia, as the country’s demand for energy continues to rise steadily. This demand will not only be driven by the government’s plans to expand electricity supply to millions of households that are currently dependent on wood for their heating, cooking, and lighting needs, but also by ambitious plans for EV adoption announced last year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/India-To-Boost-Oil-Refining-Capacity-By-77.html,"Feb 08, 2018 at 10:42 | Irina Slav","Feb 08, 2018",India To Boost Oil Refining Capacity By 77%
2018-02-08,"Crude oil imports to China hit another record last month, reaching 9.57 million barrels daily, for a total of 40.64 million tons, customs data showed. This is 400,000 bpd more than the previous record from March last year. Natural gas imports also continued to rise, hitting 7.7 million tons – the second-highest monthly import rate on record.The increase in oil imports was driven by independent refiners, the so-called teapots, who rushed to utilize their higher crude oil quotas that Beijing issued late last year. Also, a Rosneft pipeline began operating at an expanded capacity on January 1, which increased the flows of crude into the country. China’s demand for both oil and gas is higher ahead of the Spring Festival, which starts next week, Reuters notes.The increase in gas shipments and pipeline flows came after several supply outages due to a gap between demand for the fuel and available distribution infrastructure, so China bought more gas to avert further outages as it rushes to build the infrastructure that will help it with its ambitious plan to cut coal dependence and shift to natural gas.Independent refiners received quotas that were 55 percent higher than last year’s, so the import increase could be extended despite the higher oil prices.

Now Chinese crude oil import volumes also surpassed the American imports in annual figures, as it brings more refining capacity online and fills strategic inventories, while domestic oil production continues to decline.Chinese crude oil imports will continue to grow over the next few years as the use of oil products grow along with the economic and refinery capacity expansion, analysts say. The country’s import dependence is also expected to grow as imports rise and production at home declines.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/China-Oil-Imports-Hit-Another-Record-in-January.html,"Feb 08, 2018 at 09:36 | Irina Slav","Feb 08, 2018",China Oil Imports Hit Another Record In January
