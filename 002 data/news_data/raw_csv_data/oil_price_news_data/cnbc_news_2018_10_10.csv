2018-10-10,"Iran’s crude oil production fell by more than 400,000 per day from May 2018 to September, reaching an average of just 3.4 million barrels per day last month, according to the Energy Information Administration’s Short Term Energy Outlook published on Wednesday.The EIA’s report, delayed one day due to the Columbus Day holiday, pegs OPEC’s crude oil supply at 32.46 million barrels per day on average in 2018—down from 32.68 bpd in 2017. For all of 2019, the EIA forecast a dip in OPEC supplies to 32.14 bpd on average.Despite declining production from Iran and Venezuela, OPEC managed to lift production for Q3 from 32.31 bpd in Q2 to 32.52 bpd in Q3, according to the report.But while OPEC as a whole has managed to increase production despite significant losses of two of its members, oil prices have stayed stubbornly high as the market questions whether OPEC can continue to eek out oil in sufficient quantity to offset what is sure to be growing production declines in Iran and Venezuela.The EIA now estimates that OPEC’s spare production capacity is just 1.4 million barrels per day, “the lowest level since December 2016 when global inventory levels were much higher.”  Related: Will Big Oil Ever Win Back Investors’ Trust?It is precisely this combination of continual production declines, shrinking spare capacity, and dwindling inventory that has led to higher oil prices, with the EIA estimating that spot prices for Brent crude will average $81 per barrel in Q4 2018—in sharp contrast to EIA’s estimate in September’s STEO of $76 per barrel.Still, the EIA is expecting supply and demand to be “nearly balanced” in 2019, which, the STEO says, shall contribute to downward oil price pressures. Further downward price pressures will be realized when transportation bottlenecks in the Permian are addressed—which is expected to be achieved in H2 2019.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/EIA-Market-Tightens-As-Outages-From-Iran-Venezuela-Pile-Up.html,"Oct 10, 2018 at 17:49 | Julianne Geiger","Oct 10, 2018","EIA: Market Tightens As Outages From Iran, Venezuela Pile Up"
2018-10-10,"Good news is flooding into the oil and gas industry, it seems. After reports of higher exploration budgets and various discovery announcements, here’s more: Big Oil’s total free cash flow this year could hit US$175 billion, Rystad Energy has estimated, as quoted by Bloomberg. That’s five times what the supermajors made in the previous five years combined, which should impress investors, according to Bloomberg.Indeed, Big Oil has been lagging behind crude oil benchmarks in terms of price improvements. While Brent and WTI have climbed substantially over the past 12 months, the stocks of the biggest oil companies in the world have risen only modestly. They have also lagged behind stock indices in the United States, Bloomberg’s Kelly Gilblom notes.Could piles of free cash flow change investors’ minds? Only if they are accompanied by a lot more in other departments, seems to be the answer. The cash on its own has to be sustained, and it can’t be sustained if prices start falling, which will happen sooner rather than later what with India and the United States complaining about them being too high.What’s more, despite headwinds such as Hurricane Michael, which will only have a short-lived effect on prices, the IMF just this week applied a considerable amount of downward pressure on the benchmarks after it revised its outlook for the global economy, with analysts noting that a slowdown in growth could put a strain on oil and oil products demand.But let’s set free cash flow aside. Spending is also still a problem for investors. They simply don’t seem convinced that Big Oil can maintain the strict financial discipline it was forced to adopt during the downturn. And they have a pretty good reason to be suspicious: the cyclical nature of the commodity industries has given them enough historical evidence that proves pledges to maintain strict financial discipline in a period of recovery do not last.

Investors do appreciate the results of a frugal approach to spending. ConocoPhillips is a case in point here. The company earlier this year became the best-performing Big Oil stock in the United States as it began buying back shares, assuring its shareholders it will focus on returns and not growth.Yet Conoco is one single case. Overall, investors have remained skeptical about Big Oil’s promises of sustainable growth and continued frugality. In fact, some of them do not want this frugality any longer. Reuters reported last week that big oil companies’ boards are under increasing pressure to boost spending, expand production, and increase reserves. That’s just three years after everyone in oil woke up to the fact that Brent was going nowhere but down for a while longer and belts started tightening. Now, with Brent hovering around US$85, these belts are getting too tight.So, on the one hand, we have suspicious investors biding their time to start buying Big Oil again, once they make sure it will not start splashing money on projects with questionable periods and rates of return. On the other, we have existing shareholders who are eager to ride out the wave of higher oil prices, urging this same Big Oil to spend more. Big Oil must be having a hard time trying to please two so very different groups.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Will-Big-Oil-Ever-Win-Back-Investors-Trust.html,"Oct 10, 2018 at 17:01 | Irina Slav","Oct 10, 2018",Will Big Oil Ever Win Back Investors’ Trust?
2018-10-10,"“I think Saudi Arabia does have capacity that can bring to the market,” BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley told CNBC on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Oil & Money Conference in London.“But on the other side of it you have very unpredictable circumstances in Venezuela and of course, with the Iran sanctions,” Dudley noted, commenting on the current market forces driving the oil prices.As the start date of the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil is less than four weeks away, the market is jittery and prone to emotional reactions regarding the two key uncertainties over the next couple of months—how much Iranian oil will be lost to the U.S. sanctions, and how much spare capacity Saudi Arabia can bring (or is willing to bring) to offset possible steep losses.Analysts are estimating that the sanctions on Iran will remove at least 1 million bpd from the market, with some predicting losses could be as large as 2 million bpd.The only really large spare capacity is in Saudi Arabia, but the issue with this is that it has never been tested, because Saudi Arabia has never pumped more than 10.72 million bpd, its all-time high record from November 2016. Last week, the Saudis hastened to inform the market that they are currently pumping 10.7 million bpd—just shy of the all-time record high—and could even tweak that 10.7 million “slightly higher” next month.

2018-10-10,"Saudi Arabia is set to deliver extra 4 million barrels of its oil to India in November, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing several sources familiar with the plans, in what could be a Saudi move to replace the loss of Iranian barrels due to the U.S. sanctions on Tehran returning early next month.According to Reuters sources, Reliance Industries, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, and Mangalore Refinery Petrochemicals would be looking for an additional 1 million barrels each from the Saudis next month.One reason for more demand from Saudi Arabia is that the arbitrage for U.S. crude oil cargoes is currently shut, so Indian oil refiners need to procure more oil from Middle Eastern producers, one of the sources said.Last week, reports emerged that India would buy a total of 9 million barrels of oil from Iran in November, suggesting that India will continue to purchase Iranian crude even after the U.S. sanctions on Tehran return.India is Iran’s second-largest single oil customer after China and was expected to cut back on Iranian oil purchases, but unlikely to cut off completely the cheap Iranian oil that is suitable for its refineries.India wants to keep importing oil from Iran, because Tehran offers some discounts and incentives for Indian buyers at a time when the Indian government is struggling with higher oil prices and a weakening local currency that additionally weighs on its oil import bill.  Related: A New Era Of Geopolitical Risk In Global Oil MarketsBut the U.S. continues to insist that it expects Iranian oil buyers to bring their purchases down to zero.Earlier this week, Indian officials said that they hoped India could secure a waiver from the United States, because it has significantly reduced purchases of Iranian oil. Late last week, the United States hinted that it was at least considering waivers.Meanwhile, archrival Saudi Arabia and Iran are exchanging in the media diverging opinions on who’s making up for lost Iranian oil barrels, or rather whether it’s even possible to do so. The Saudis insist that they have been more than compensating and have capacity to turn on if the market demands it. Iran, on the other hand, is steadfast in its claims that no one can compensate.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudis-To-Boost-Oil-Supply-To-India-As-Iran-Sanctions-Kick-In.html,"Oct 10, 2018 at 09:24 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 10, 2018",Saudis To Boost Oil Supply To India As Iran Sanctions Kick In
