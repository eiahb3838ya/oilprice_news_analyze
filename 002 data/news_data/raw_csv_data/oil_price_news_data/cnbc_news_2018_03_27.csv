2018-03-27,"Big Oil showed in its latest earnings that it has adapted to the lower-for-longer oil prices and is now making nearly as much profit as it did when oil prices were $100 a barrel.So, is this the golden age of big oil? Goldman Sachs thinks so.If it is, stock prices aren’t showing it.Shares of the world’s largest non-state oil companies have lagged both the recent oil price increases and the general equity market trends—a sign that investors are yet to believe that Big Oil is still a worthy investment case amid the peak oil demand and EV boom narrative.But Goldman Sachs believes that we are at the beginning of a ‘new golden age’ for the seven biggest oil companies -- ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, Total, Eni, and Statoil.The ‘Seven Sisters’ of Big Oil today, as Goldman dubs them, are set to increase their attraction for investors. Why? Because they’re in a sweet spot that will see them rake in the largest cash flow growth in two decades amid rising oil prices and low operating costs.“We see this as the start of a new golden age for Big Oil’s reborn Seven Sisters,” Goldman analysts said in a report, adding that it is “also a favorable environment for returns in the commodity.”The oil price crash has resulted in a slump in share prices, cutting their weight in the equity indexes to 5 percent—or less than half of their usual weighting. But patience comes to those who wait…  Related: Permian Drillers Prepare For Double-Digit Cost JumpBig Oil is now set to reap the rewards of the cost cuts and bounce back from that 5-percent weighting which is the lowest in 50 years, according to Goldman.Just before the latest downturn, the 2011-2013 period saw “the largest number of project sanctions in the history of the oil and gas industry,” Goldman said.“While those investments are likely to yield low through-cycle returns, all these projects are now coming into production, releasing unproductive capital and providing the industry with the strongest production, cash flow growth in two decades,” the investment bank noted.Contrary to many investors’ belief that the best times for the biggest oil companies are when oil prices are very high, Goldman argues that the lavish spending at $100 oil eats into companies’ returns because of inefficiencies and cost inflation.After the 2014 oil price crash, the industry entered a period of contraction in which many smaller companies didn’t survive, while international oil majors slashed spending, cut jobs, and repositioned portfolios to make profits at halved oil prices.We’re now entering the ‘restraint’ phase of the cycle, and Big Oil stands out among others in taking advantage of the lower cost to extract oil—these costs have yet to catch up with the rise in oil prices lately.This ‘restraint’ phase is “defined by backwardation, cost deflation, and consolidation--when a high-risk premium on long-term oil prices restrains investment and creates high barriers to entry,” Goldman’s Michele Della Vigna said in the report, as carried by Barron’s.Goldman Sachs started expressing bullish views on Oil Majors as early as in September 2017, saying that simplification, standardization, and deflation were helping them to generate more cash at $50 oil than at oil prices at $100.Then, at the end of last year, Goldman’s Della Vigna said that Big Oil was set to witness its best year in decades in 2018.The investment cycle at $100 oil price “looked like a great time for the oil sector, but it was a horrendous time for Big Oil as effectively everybody ate their lunch,” Della Vigna told Bloomberg in mid-December.Indeed, oil majors entered 2018 reporting much higher profits for Q4 and 2017, increased cash flows, called the end of the scrip dividends, some (Total, Statoil, Eni) said they would raise dividends, and some (Shell, BP) said they would resume share buybacks.“Creating more value for shareholders” was a phrase too often heard at conference calls, but investors have not been too convinced, and the stocks’ performance has been underwhelming.

Regardless of the progress made, the sector’s correlation with oil prices tends to swamp all other factors,” Flowers said.“It may be that an investor bias against oil stocks won’t change until a sustained price recovery is in sight,” WoodMac’s chairman said, arguing that Big Oil should continue doing what it has been doing in the lower-for-longer oil price world because it’s the right thing to do.“Investors will gradually wake up to it,” Flowers says.Analysts concur that Big Oil has turned the page of production and profit performance. We’re now waiting to see if investors will resume buying the “shareholder value” and “world-class investment case” selling points the international oil majors have been feeding them.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Invisible-Sweet-Spot-For-Big-Oil.html,"Mar 27, 2018 at 16:59 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Mar 27, 2018",The Invisible Sweet Spot For Big Oil
2018-03-27,"U.S. shale companies expect a double-digit cost increase in services across the oil patch, and the Permian in particular, as the industry recovered from the downturn and is now growing fast.The Permian is the leader of U.S. oil production growth, and service costs in the most prolific shale play are set to continue to rise, shale companies and industry analysts expect, as drilling contractors, fracking crews, and frac sand, for example, are in high demand.Oilfield service providers, who were hit hard during the slump, are now upbeat for the first time in three years, expecting a busy North American shale activity.  U.S. oil production is already exceeding 10 million bpd – a level higher than Saudi Arabia’s current output, and the United States is expected to soon topple Russia as the world’s largest crude oil producer, possibly as early as later this year.As the leading shale basin in the U.S., cost inflation is showing most prominently in the Permian.Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, for example, expects service costs in its Permian operations to increase by between 10 percent and 15 percent, chief executive Al Walker said at the Scotia Howard Weil energy conference in New Orleans.“We’re just going to see some natural creep in service costs that will just have to work its way into the system,” Walker said. “If oil prices rise higher, that will increase the pressure on prices.”According to Westwood Global Energy Group, the supply chain in the U.S. onshore is stretched, and the market expects “double-digit” price increases this year.Related: China's Oil Futures Launch With A BangThe cost increase is expected to average around 15 percent, but in the proppant segment, the price inflation is significantly higher, Westwood said in January.Commenting on upstream costs in the U.S. onshore, Wood Mackenzie said at the end of last year:“The tension going forward will be between productivity gains (in our view, the greatest perhaps already realised) and resurgent cost inflation (still playing out).”  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Permian-Drillers-Prepare-For-Double-Digit-Cost-Jump.html,"Mar 27, 2018 at 14:27 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Mar 27, 2018",Permian Drillers Prepare For Double-Digit Cost Jump
2018-03-27,"Offshore crude oil extraction, including deepwater, is closing in on shale in terms of cost thanks to new production technologies, a senior Chevron executive said at an industry event, as quoted by Bloomberg.The company is laying pump networks on the ocean floor, connecting new wells with already installed platforms, cutting its costs considerably and bringing deepwater oil closer to competing with shale on an equal footing, vice president for upstream, Jay Johnson, said during a presentation at the Scotia Howard Weil Conference in Louisiana.The upbeat attitude is not limited to Chevron executives, either. Transocean’s chief executive, Jeremy Thigpen, said that at the moment, most of the 29 deepwater oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico have a breakeven level of between US$40 and US$45 a barrel.Deepwater exploration was the object of much lament during the downturn as it is traditionally costlier than onshore conventional and shale exploration. Indeed, investments were slashed across the industry.But now that prices have recovered somewhat, offshore explorers are back in the game and seem determined to stay despite shale.Last year in May, Wood Mackenzie analysts reported that offshore drilling costs were going down, despite still weak oil prices, reflecting the efficiency of the strict cost discipline and the tech innovation drive that helped the oil industry weather the crisis.  Related: Trump Looks To Undo Fuel Efficiency StandardsIn fact, Wood Mac said last May, by this year some offshore oil projects could break even if crude trades at US$50 a barrel.Offshore is being helped by rising costs onshore, as well.A February report from Westwood Energy said that deepwater oil projects are becoming more competitive because the costs of shale drillers are rising on the back of growing frac sand amounts used per well that are pushing the market into a shortage, sending frac sand prices sky-high.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Offshore-Oil-Closes-In-On-Shale.html,"Mar 27, 2018 at 12:52 | Irina Slav","Mar 27, 2018",Offshore Oil Closes In On Shale
