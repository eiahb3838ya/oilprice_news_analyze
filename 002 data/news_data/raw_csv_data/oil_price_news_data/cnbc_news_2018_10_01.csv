2018-10-01,"Oil prices rose on Monday on news that OPEC only added a modest amount of additional supply to the market in September, contrary to previous expectations.Saudi Arabia had promised that it would ramp up oil production in September and again in October, despite the non-decision from OPEC+ on an official increase in output. However, a report from Reuters suggests that while Riyadh followed through on this pledge last month, it only added a relatively modest 50,000 barrels per day compared to August levels.In fact, all of OPEC produced 32.85 million barrels per day (mb/d) in September, an increase of only 90,000 bpd on net compared to a month earlier. The gains were largely possible only because of the restoration in output from Libya, where production jumped above 1 mb/d.If you exclude Libya from the equation – since Libya is not part of the binding production cut OPEC+ deal – the compliance with the output limits rose from 122 percent to 128 percent in September. In terms of production volumes, that translates into a 70,000-bpd decline.OPEC was still able to increase production with the help of Libya, but market concerns about supply tightness were hardly put to rest. After all, Libya’s increase is likely a one-off, a restoration of disrupted output from prior months. And the ongoing conflict in the country means that there is always a risk of more disruptions. Nigeria also resolved some outages, adding roughly 50,000 bpd last month. Reuters noted that Angola increased production in September on the startup of a new field, although the country’s production level is still far below its allotted limit as part of the OPEC+ deal.These are meaningful increases in supply, but they will be difficult to replicate.  Related: The Middle East Nuclear Race Is Reaching A Boiling PointAs a result, the main focus for the oil market over the next few weeks will be on the tension between falling supplies from Iran and Venezuela versus the increase in supply from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia’s 50,000-bpd increase in September was outweighed by the 100,000-bpd loss from Iran.Major investors do not appear to buy Saudi Arabia’s insistence that the market is well-supplied. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their bullish bets on crude futures for the week ending on September 25, the fifth consecutive week of an increase in net-length. The bullish positioning is concentrated in Brent futures, not WTI, a reflection of tightening supply in the Middle East while record U.S. shale production is struggling with inadequate midstream capacity.Meanwhile, there were a few other pieces of news that may have played a role in pushing Brent over $84 per barrel on Monday. First, even as shale drillers continue to press forward, the U.S. rig count fell on Friday, which offers some evidence of a drilling slowdown. “Trading this morning has also seen futures creep upward, potentially on the back of a decline in the U.S. weekly rig count last week,” JBC Energy wrote in a note. The oil rig count fell by 3 last week, two of which came out of the Permian.More importantly, China may be succumbing to U.S. pressure to cut oil imports from Iran. Sinopec reportedly cut its oil imports from Iran by half last month, although specific numbers were unclear. Sources told Reuters that American officials traveled to China to more or less issue “an ultimatum” to cut Iranian oil purchases.  Related: Refiners Struggle To Adapt To The Shale Boom“Prices were lent renewed buoyancy on Friday by the surprising news that a state oil company from China has significantly reduced its oil purchases from Iran. Sources familiar with the matter report that loadings were halved to 130,000 barrels per day last month,” Commerzbank wrote in a note. “China and its state-owned companies had been thought immune to the looming US sanctions. Apparently this is not the case after all.”Commerzbank said that with China cutting back, there is a risk that Iran’s oil exports fall by a massive 2 mb/d. “In response to the latest developments, we are upwardly revising our year’s end forecast for Brent to $85 per barrel,” the bank said.It remains to be seen if this scenario plays out, but the loss of 2 mb/d of Iranian exports would be very hard to cover. OPEC would struggle to compensate for a loss of this size, even if it were to use most of its spare capacity. That leaves open the possibility of a release from the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve or American exemptions for country’s buying Iranian oil. However, this is just speculation.“I don’t think anybody can anticipate how this all plays out in the next two months,” said Barclays’ Mr. Cohen, according to the Wall Street Journal.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Underwhelming-OPEC-Fuels-Oil-Price-Rally.html,"Oct 01, 2018 at 17:49 | Nick Cunningham","Oct 01, 2018",Underwhelming OPEC Fuels Oil Price Rally
2018-10-01,"Market participants and analysts are all focused on the imminent oil supply gap that is opening with the U.S. sanctions on Iran just five weeks away.But beyond the shortest term, a larger and more alarming gap in global oil supply is looming—experts forecast that unless large oil discoveries are made soon, the world could be short of oil as early as in the mid-2020s.The latest such prediction comes from energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which sees a supply gap opening up in the middle of the next decade. At the current level of low oil discoveries and barring technology breakthrough beyond WoodMac’s assumptions, that supply gap could soar to 3 million bpd by 2030, to 7 million bpd by 2035, and to as much as 12 million bpd by 2040.It’s not that discoveries aren’t being made, they just aren’t enough to offset the natural decline at mature fields while global oil demand is still expected to continue to rise.The main reason for lower discoveries is that spending on exploration has drastically plunged since the 2014 oil price crash. The good news is, according to Wood Mackenzie, that the volume of new discoveries is correlated with spending on exploration. So if spend were to increase, the chance of more and major oil discoveries gets higher.As early as the beginning of this year, WoodMac said that the share of exploration of upstream investment has slipped to below 10 percent since 2016 and is not about to recover. “This could be the new normal, with the days of one dollar in six or seven going to exploration forever in the past,” the consultancy said in its ‘5 Things to look for in 2018.’  Related: Refiners Struggle To Adapt To The Shale BoomOver the past year, however, exploration seems to have gotten “its mojo back,” WoodMac said in June, noting that oil discoveries offshore Guyana continued to deliver more oil volumes, major high-value discoveries were made in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as well as on the Mexican side of the Gulf, by Shell, Chevron, Talos, and Eni.The dramatic cut in spending, including on exploration, has done one good thing to the industry—it forced companies to realign strategies and look to do more with less. According to Andrew Latham, Vice President, Global Exploration at WoodMac, “this will be the first time in a decade the industry has actually created rather than destroyed value.”On the flip side, the oil industry is now finding less oil and gas than it used to, Latham noted.So, “Fact is, we need more Guyanas, a lot more, and we need them soon,” Simon Flowers, Chairman and Chief Analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said in a post last week.Related: OPEC Secretly Discusses 500,000 Bpd Production BoostThe industry basically needs to replace one North Sea each year, as the world needs to replace 3 million bpd of supply decline from mature fields, while global oil demand continues to grow at a robust pace, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its Oil 2018 report in March.Global upstream investment—which includes exploration spending—has just started to rebound from the 2015-2016 lows, the IEA said in its report on 2018 world energy investment in July.With the oil price crash, investment plummeted in 2015 and 2016 from the peaks in 2014, but last year’s investment rebounded by 2 percent in real terms, the IEA said, expecting the same level of growth this year as well.Companies are still keeping very tight discipline on capital expenditure and costs and are looking to reward shareholders with fatter dividends now that they are getting more cash from the upstream divisions thanks to the higher oil prices. But the industry as a whole can’t afford to neglect spending on exploration because a supply gap may be lurking just around the corner.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Oil-Industry-Needs-Large-New-Discoveries-Very-Soon.html,"Oct 01, 2018 at 17:08 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 01, 2018","The Oil Industry Needs Large New Discoveries, Very Soon"
2018-10-01,"Ever since war broke out in Eastern Ukraine, the energy industry has been guessing what will happen to Ukraine’s gas transit and its transmission system. In the background, however, Ukraine’s oil sector has remained in tantalizing agony, as only one out of the country’s six refineries is currently functioning (at a 10% utilization rate), most of the products supply taken over by neighboring countries and all this with no end in sight. Almost every refinery was built with some sort of Russian involvement – as an owner, co-investor or crude supplier – yet after 2014, against the background of unprecedented antagonism between Ukraine and Russia, Russian companies have left the country for good. Now the question is: who will step into the vacant spot? So far it seems that no one is willing to.Kremenchug RefineryNominal capacity: 18 mtpaCurrent refining status: utilization rate at a mere 10-15%Out of Ukraine’s six oil refineries only one is functioning currently, the Kremenchug Refinery, even though at a mere 10% utilization rate. Another Soviet remnant from the 1960s, for much of modern Ukraine’s history it has been under the control of Ukrtatnafta – initially a joint venture between Tatneft and the Igor Kolomoyskiy-led holding, Privat. Following a successful 2007 hostile takeover, the ownership structure now includes the privately-owned Privat (56%) and the Ukrainian state (43%), a pairing which proved to be contentious to the maximum. Ukrainian authorities want to gain full control of the refinery, for reasons manifold – among others, Ukraine has to pay Russia $150 million for the illegal seizure of Kremenchug which happened against the government’s will. Adding to the piquancy of the situation, Ukrainian authorities have no idea how much crude exactly does Kremenchug actually refine – overall, we should expect a protracted quarrel until the dust settles.Odessa RefineryNominal capacity: 2.8 mtpaCurrent refining status: idle since 2013It is in many ways understandable why Odessa was chosen as a refinery site back in 1937 and why the possibility of the Odessa Refinery being brought back onstream remains a real one, despite a relatively low Nelson complexity index of 3.9. Close to the Black Sea, Odessa was LUKOIL’s asset for almost 14 years (1999-2013) and it is largely due to the Russian major that its refinery slate became significantly lighter – i.e. in the 1990s HFO took up half of the yield, by early 2010s it was a quarter of it. However, as the stakes rose economic disputes loomed large here, too - LUKOIL could not find a modus operandi with the port terminal operator Privat (port fees artificially high) and decided to sell the refinery in 2013 to avoid greater damage. LUKOIL sold it to the Yanukovych-close VETEK energy group, hence, after the 2014 coup the Ukrainian state tried to lay its hands on the refinery – the legal battle between the two promises to linger for many years to come.

Before it was sold to TNK-BP in 2000, it mostly functioned in a on-and-off way, its fortunes turned to the better afterwards even though the refinery’s performance remained to be volatile in terms of profitability. As Rosneft swallowed up TNK in 2011, the refinery ended up in its hands, as it turned out, for a brief period. Just two years later in 2013, the Yanukovych coup and the military conflict that followed, the Russian state giant initiated the Lisichansk’s modernization, only to roll back any financial injections later. Given the refinery‘s substantial war-caused damages combined with the current Ukrainian authorities anti-Russian stance, Lisichansk will most likely remain a grim reminder of how sour just things turned.Kherson RefineryNominal capacity: 7 mtpaCurrent refining status: idle since 2006Kherson, similarly to Drogobich and Nadvornaya (see below), saw no Russian involvement, hence due to a lack of substantial capital investments is one of the least likely candidates to be brought onstream ever again despite its relatively high nominal refining capacity. After a tumultuous period of ever-changing ownership in the 1990s, the refinery has been under the control of the Ukrainian business group Continuum, which has used the refinery as a product storage facility. Any modernization initiatives were generally linked to foreign investment, not Ukrainian funds. Two Chinese national companies, Sinopec and later CNPC were alleged to hold negotiations in early 2010s over a potential takeover, however, the talks were largely a market reconnaissance undertaking.  Related: The Biggest Wildcard In The Iran Sanctions SagaDrogobich RefineryNominal capacity: 3.22 mtpaCurrent refining status: idle since 2011One of the three refineries owned by the Ukrainian consortium Privat, the 1963-built refinery has been out of operation for seven years and is only used as a storage asset. As usually with Ukrainian idle refineries, it requires a significant amount of money to be modernized and brought to a competitive level – with a Nelson complexity of 3.5, Drogobich cannot even produce Euro 4-quality fuels, let alone meet Euro-5 quality standards (since January 2018, Euro-5 has been the standard required by the Ukrainian state). The likelihood that any investor will want to renovate Drogobich is close to zero, realistically it would be much easier to build a new one than to replace all of its units from the 1950s.The sixth refinery, Nadvornaya, traces its foundation to 1897 and is in many ways similar to Drogobich – more or less offline since 2007 and being so outdated that it cannot produce fuel even compliant with Euro-3 standards, its future is remarkably dim. All the more so that when it did refine some oil in the past, it refined domestic Ukrainian the output of which almost halved to 32kbpd in the last decade. What to do in such a futureless state of things? Three Russian majors have left in the last ten years, either due to political pressures or weak economics, and no Western major filled their shoes. Until the self-defeating oil sector internal showdown comes to a close, it is highly unlikely there will be any to do it. Doubly unlikely that Russian investors will want to return anytime soon.By Viktor Katona for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Who-Will-Save-Ukraines-Dying-Refineries.html,"Oct 01, 2018 at 12:48 | Viktor Katona","Oct 01, 2018",Who Will Save Ukraine’s Dying Refineries?
2018-10-01,"Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed has discussed the restart of crude oil production in the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait during a meeting with Kuwait’s Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, Reuters reported ahead of the Sunday visit, quoting sources in the know, who declined to be named.Prince Mohammed was accompanied by Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, the sources also said.Joint oil production in the neutral zone was suspended in 2015, but earlier this month the Financial Times reported that the two countries were mulling over a restart amid rising oil prices and the matching rise in worry among large oil buyers.The neutral zone, the FT reported at the time, could be pumping half a million barrels daily in a few months, according to the International Energy Agency, which would add to more than 10 million bpd of Saudi production and almost 3 million bpd on Kuwaiti production based on the latest figures for July.The talks on the production restart come despite earlier statements from Al-Falih that Saudi Arabia does not see the need for higher output: according to the minister, the market was near balance, despite the rising benchmarks and the upcoming sanctions against Iran. Now, it seems, the world’s top exporter of oil has had a change of heart.Saudi Arabia is considered to be the oil producer with the most spare capacity among OPEC members, with the Energy Information Administration calculating it at between 1.5 and 2 million bpd. Some industry observers, however, have questioned the figures, which are defined as the amount of daily production that can be launched within 30 days and sustained for at least 90 days, according to EIA.With Venezuela’s production falling consistently and the Iran sanctions as well as Iraq’s difficulties in boosting its oil production, OPEC’s total spare capacity is now estimated to be just 1.49 million bpd this quarter, according to a different estimate. This certainly raises the question whether the cartel can boost production enough to rein in the price rise ahead of the sanctions or within days of their entry into force.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudi-Arabia-Kuwait-Discuss-New-Oil-Production-In-Neutral-Zone.html,"Oct 01, 2018 at 10:49 | Irina Slav","Oct 01, 2018","Saudi Arabia, Kuwait Discuss New Oil Production In Neutral Zone"
