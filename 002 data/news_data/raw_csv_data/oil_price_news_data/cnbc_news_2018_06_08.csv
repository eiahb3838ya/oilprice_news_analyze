2018-06-08,"The upcoming OPEC meeting on June 22 is shaping up to be a contentious one, after news broke that the U.S. government asked Saudi Arabia to increase oil production before Washington pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal.Earlier last week, news surfaced that the U.S. government asked Saudi Arabia to boost output to relieve pressure on prices. But Reuters followed up with a report on June 7, adding more context to that story. According to Reuters, a high level Trump administration official called Saudi Arabia a day before Trump was set to announce the U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal, asking for more oil supply to cover for disruptions from Iran.The last time the U.S. government pressured OPEC into adding supply, it was also over Iran. The Obama administration wanted the cartel to offset disrupted Iranian production, after an international coalition put stringent sanctions on Iran in 2012. Roughly 1 million barrels per day were knocked offline.While the Trump administration’s request might irk OPEC members, with Iran obviously the most aggrieved, the apparent willingness of Saudi Arabia to comply with Washington’s request has ignited furor from within the group.“It’s crazy and astonishing to see instruction coming from Washington to Saudi to act and replace a shortfall of Iran’s export due to their Illegal sanction on Iran and Venezuela,” Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said in comments to Reuters. He said that OPEC would not simply comply with Washington’s requests. “No one in OPEC will act against two of its founder members,” he said, referring to Iran and Venezuela. “The U.S. tried it last time against Iran, but oil prices got to $140 a barrel.”“OPEC will not accept such a humiliation. How arrogant and ignorant one could be (to) underestimate the history of 60 years’ cooperation among competitors,” he said.Venezuela wrote to OPEC members, asking them to denounce U.S. sanctions, a request similar to the one Iran made recently. “I kindly request solidarity and support from our fellow members,” Venezuelan oil minister Manuel Quevedo wrote. The group should discuss “the constraining effects of unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States of America, which represent an extraordinary aggression, financially and economically, for our national oil industry’s operations and the stability of the market.”The comments suggest that a good portion of the cartel is lining up against any move to increase production. It could set the stage for a heated meeting in Vienna in two weeks’ time. “It might be one of the worst OPEC meetings since 2011,"" Eugen Weinberg of Commerzbank told CNBC.Related: Will Saudi Arabia Listen To U.S. Demands For More Oil?He was referring to the infamous 2011 meeting that fell apart over sharp differences in opinion, with Saudi Arabia wanting to increase production to ease triple-digit oil prices following the conflagration in parts of North Africa and the Middle East during the Arab Spring. But the Saudis were shot down by much of the rest of the group, which opposed lifting output. Former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi said it was “one of the worst meetings we have ever had.”Although not exactly the same, the differences back then echo those of today. Saudi Arabia, wary of hurting global economic growth and also cautious about not incentivizing too much high-cost supply, wants to add some barrels back onto the market.Just about every OPEC member outside of the Gulf is unable to increase production anyway, so it is of little surprise that they are opposed to higher production. Venezuela’s output is falling fast. Angola is also losing production. Libya and Nigeria seemed to have hit a temporary ceiling, with security issues always looming as a supply risk. Also, they don’t have official limits on their output as part of the OPEC deal, so there is little upside for them in supporting production increases from other countries.Iran, obviously, is facing production outages from U.S. sanctions, so it likely can’t increase output even if it wanted to. Officials from Iraq and Algeria made negative comments over the past week about the possibility of higher output.From the non-OPEC camp, Mexico’s production is falling anyway, so it has little to no ability to respond to change in policy.Ultimately, the only beneficiaries of higher production would be Saudi Arabia and Russia, and to a lesser extent some of the Gulf States like Kuwait and the UAE.Related: Oil Kingdom In Crisis: Saudi Royal Family Rift Turns ViolentBut, Saudi Arabia and Russia probably can’t simply allot themselves more production allowances without risking a full-blown revolt from the rest of the group. So, they will likely need to allocate more production to everyone, but even the act of deciding on a formula will also be highly contentious. Still, it will be somewhat of a formality for most members since they can’t increase production anyway.So, there are a few possibilities from the upcoming meeting. First, Saudi Arabia and Russia convince the group to agree to an increase in output, and while everyone nominally is allowed to increase output a bit, the two top producers make up the lion’s share of the increase. That will require sacrifice from much of the group, who won’t be able to increase production and will have to stomach lower oil prices.Another possibility is a breakdown in negotiations and Saudi Arabia and Russia go their own way, increasing output. Or, talks could breakdown and there is no change in output, although with the upside risk to prices, this seems unlikely.Whatever the outcome, odds are that the upcoming meeting is the most combative we have seen in a while.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Geopolitical-Tensions-Reach-Boiling-Point-Ahead-Of-OPEC-Meeting.html,"Jun 08, 2018 at 17:02 | Nick Cunningham","Jun 08, 2018",Geopolitical Tensions Reach Boiling Point Ahead Of OPEC Meeting
2018-06-08,"Canada may be the fourth largest producer and third largest exporter of oil in the world, but it has one sole customer of its oil—the United States.At the end of last month, Canada took a step toward ensuring that its oil would have an export outlet to the world’s fastest-growing energy market, Asia.Analysts believe that the federal government stepping in to save the Trans Mountain expansion project has boosted the chances that the pipeline will be built and give Canada an export outlet from the Pacific Coast to the Asian markets. The industry is cautiously optimistic, but some companies say that Canada must do more to level the playing field for its oil.Last year, Canada’s crude oil exports increased by 6.5 percent annually to 3.3 million bpd. Of those, exports to destinations other than the U.S. accounted for just 0.8 percent of all, according to data by the National Energy Board (NEB).Due to congested takeaway capacity and lack of enough pipelines to either the Pacific or the Atlantic Coasts, Canada’s oil is currently priced at a huge discount to the U.S. benchmark. The discount at which Western Canadian Select (WCS)—the benchmark price of oil from Canada’s oil sands delivered at Hardisty, Alberta—trades relative to West Texas Intermediate (WTI) has been US$20, and at times US$30 a barrel this year.Fierce opposition in British Columbia has forced Kinder Morgan to reconsider its commitment to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline that would increase the daily capacity of the pipeline to 890,000 bpd from 300,000 bpd. So the Government of Canada reached an agreement with Kinder Morgan last month to buy the Trans Mountain Expansion Project and related pipeline and terminal assets for US$3.5 billion (C$4.5 billion).  Related: Oil Falls On OPEC UncertaintyThe Canadian push to seek more customers (and higher prices) for its oil coincides with a heightened trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada.“You could argue the timing was intentional, but this was going on well before Nafta [renegotiations],” Dana Peterson, U.S. and Canada economist at Citigroup, told CNBC. “The Canadian government needs another venue for evacuating oil, and that’s westward. They need another buyer, and that’s Asia.”Canada owning Trans Mountain greatly boosts the chances of the project, although it’s not a certainty yet, according to analysts.  “As a crown corporation, it would have a better standing in these challenges,” Jackie Forrest, vice president of energy research at Arc Financial Group, told CNBC, referring to the several lawsuits against the project that B.C. has filed in recent months.Access to new markets—especially to fast-growing Asia in which all other major oil exporters compete to sell—is important to both Canada’s oil industry and government, according to Forrest.“The prices to Asia, minus the transportation costs, means every barrel that goes to Asia would get a higher price than it would in North America. Because of the discount for WTI (West Texas Intermediate), selling it to North America is not nearly as profitable as selling into Asia,” Forrest told CNBC.Although the amount of Canadian oil that would be shipped to Asia is not huge, the project—if completed—would be a game-changer for Canada’s oil industry, according to John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital.“This move by the Canadian government to build the pipeline sets up a future U.S.-Canadian rivalry for Asian market share,” Kilduff told CNBC.“The TMEP [Trans Mountain expansion pipeline] is critical infrastructure needed to move Canadian energy to world markets and restore investor confidence in Canada’s economy and political system. It signals Canada is open to business and energy trade with international investors,” the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) said, commenting on the government’s move to buy the pipeline.  Related: Was This Just A Temporary Pullback In Oil?However, Steve Williams, chief executive of one of the biggest Canadian producers, Suncor, is more cautious and says that his view that Canada is lagging behind in competitiveness hasn’t changed with the government buying Trans Mountain, although he is confident the pipeline will be built.“On the one hand, it’s a clear, unambiguous commitment that it’s a piece of infrastructure which is in the national interest and needs to be built. On the other hand, it’s also recognizing that the normal processes didn’t work very well,” Williams said this week.Suncor will not be splashing money on new growth projects, because Canada’s oil industry’s competitiveness is “not in great shape,” Williams said.“And competitiveness for me is the sum of all those things, so royalties, taxation, regulatory certainty, confidence in regulators today and in the future. And we need to make some progress,” the manager noted.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Canada-Bets-On-Trans-Mountain-Expansion-To-Sell-Oil-In-Asia.html,"Jun 08, 2018 at 17:01 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jun 08, 2018",Canada Bets On Trans Mountain Expansion To Sell Oil In Asia
2018-06-08,"The amazing compliance from OPEC members and Russia to production guidelines has drained the surplus from global supplies and brought oil prices up to trade in the mid-$60’s here in the U.S., and the mid-$70’s everywhere else. But, the recent announcement from the Saudis and Russia promising a production increase of up to 1 million barrels per day to limits that have been in place since December of 2016 has the oil markets taking a breath from their upwards march. For now, the signals of more supply are weighing on the oil price, with the meeting still almost two weeks away.The fascinating dynamic between the three most important players here – the US, Russia and the Saudis – is going to tell the real story of what the final outcome from the OPEC meeting will be and where oil prices are going to go from here.Let’s analyze the motivations of all three and make a plan:In the U.S., Trump has tweeted his unhappiness with higher oil prices, and there have been indications that he’s gotten some concessions from OPEC to increase production and keep gas prices at a manageable level through the midterm elections.On the other side of the globe, it’s clear that Russia has benefited enormously from higher oil prices – but their loyalty to OPEC and the global supply chain is historically weak – if there is a commitment for another 1m barrels a day to be added to the production pot, Russia is going to lobby for a lot of that allocation for itself.Last, we have the Saudis, who at the very least need to look like they are helping President Trump towards stable gas prices. After all, the Saudis were virulently opposed to the Iranian Nuclear deal and the U.S. President did deliver on his promise to abandon it and reinstate sanctions. However, and this is a big caveat, the Saudis still must make their IPO of Saudi Aramco hugely successful if young prince Muhammad bin Salman is to survive, and for that, they’ll need an even higher price for oil – optimally over $100 a barrel.So, what do I think will happen? The tightrope that the Saudis need to walk is the key here – delivering the impression of keeping oil prices lower, yet still obtaining at least 100% compliance on the original production deal through 2018. By doing that, they are assured that global stockpiles will still continue to drain, if more slowly than they have for the past several months. Bin Salman and al-Naimi have shown a brilliant ability to walk these tightropes in the past year and a half, and I expect them to successfully navigate it this time.So, one should expect oil prices to remain moderated up to the meeting date of June 22nd, and with that, oil stocks to remain moderately priced as well. It is possible the many will perceive the pressures of Russia and the U.S. to be too much for the Saudis, predict the meeting will be a disaster and therefore sending oil stocks significantly lower immediately prior to it.I see this as an opportunity.Continued bottlenecks in the Permian shale play will finally cap oil increases there, and with continued 100% compliance assured by crafty Saudi moves, the oil price will again resume its steady creep higher – in spite of President Trump’s angry tweets.For us, there remains the same strategy that we’ve been following, only now it should become more aggressive: To accumulate cash by jettisoning under-performing Permian shale producers and centering back into those more mature EFS and Bakken E+P’s that are less than 50% hedged into the coming year. Those names include Continental Resources (CLR) and Marathon (MRO).",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Pullback-In-Oil-Prices-Provides-An-Opportunity.html,"Jun 08, 2018 at 16:33 | Dan Dicker","Jun 08, 2018",Pullback In Oil Prices Provides An Opportunity
