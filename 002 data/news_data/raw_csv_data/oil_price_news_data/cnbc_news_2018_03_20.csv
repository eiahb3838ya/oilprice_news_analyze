2018-03-20,"The faster oil services firms and oil exploration companies adopt digitalization, the more data they generate with every well they drill and every digital map of oil resources they create—but that data is now the subject of hot debate as the oil industry tries to figure out who owns that data.In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the Internet of Everything (IoE), data about oil resources and oil wells is so important that companies across the oil industry’s chain are now seeking to explicitly state in contracts who owns that data—the oil service firms or their exploration customers.On the one hand, oilfield service companies have realized how valuable the data they get can be, while on the other hand, the E&P companies say they own everything coming out of their wells, including the data. This is setting the stage for a battle over the other most valuable resource in the oil industry, Bloomberg’s David Wethe writes.Data and digitalization have transformed many industries, including oil and gas, and they will continue to do so, creating billions of U.S. dollars from the businesses of big data analytics and digital oil fields.As early as in 2015, Cisco Consulting Services and Oxford Economics said in research that the oil and gas industry adopting IoE has the potential to increase global GDP by up to 0.8 percent—or US$816 billion—by 2025. Cisco Consulting Services estimated that the adoption cost of the IoE would be about US$180 billion for the industry, but over a 10-year period, the multiplier impact would be about three to four times when it’s translated to the global economy.   Related: OPEC Doubles Down On Draining Oil InventoriesAnother key insight from the research was that oil and gas leaders named “data analytics for faster, better decision-making” as their number-one driver to invest in IoE.  More recently, the “Accenture and Microsoft 2017 Upstream Oil and Gas Digital Trends Survey” showed that in 3-5 years, over 70 percent of more than 300 leading upstream companies plan “more” or “significantly more” investment, transitioning to areas such as high-performance computing, wearables, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, blockchain, and mixed reality.So, the battle over who owns the exponentially rising amount of data has made companies carefully word their service contracts to explicitly state who owns what, including data.“It was always pretty straightforward, and there was never really a lot of conversation about it,” Garrett Jackson, vice president of drilling and completions at Devon Energy, told Bloomberg in an interview.“Now the clauses are getting to be a page, page and a half long, trying to parse out what parts are the contractor, what parts are the operator, when there’s overlap, how that’s divided up,” Jackson said.Oilfield service companies could sell ‘digital libraries’ with the data they have, thus boosting their revenues.“It’s like Netflix for oil and gas,” John Gibson, an advisor at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co who previously ran the oil-services business for Halliburton, told Bloomberg. “Imagine that all data is like a movie that many different people want to watch, but they want to watch it at different times.”Related: Natural Gas Is Under AttackBut E&P firms increasingly believe that it’s their data to analyze and that data is one of their most valuable resources to help them make faster decisions and beat competitors.“Data is king and one of our most valuable resources,” Sandeep Bhakhri, chief information and technology officer at EOG Resources, said at a conference call last year. “You have to own the data. You cannot outsource its collection, analysis or delivery,” said Bhakhri, whose employer EOG has been dubbed “the Apple of oil” by analysts because of its use of in-house technology and data analytics. EOG has dozens of apps it has developed to help engineers track well data, and it has been analyzing data on thousands of horizontal wells across the U.S. shale plays with what it calls “black boxes” that it has been deploying on rigs. In today’s digital world in which data in the oil industry is nearly as valuable as oil itself, exploration companies are boosting investment in analytics and protecting proprietary data, while service companies have realized how valuable data is to their customers and are selling data, insights, and analytics tools to them.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Big-Oils-Trillion-Dollar-Data-Battle.html,"Mar 20, 2018 at 15:41 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Mar 20, 2018",Big Oil’s Trillion Dollar Data Battle
2018-03-20,"One of the world’s biggest commodity traders, Trafigura, was the largest exporter of U.S. crude oil and condensate over the past year, its CEO Jeremy Weir said on Tuesday.Trafigura wants to capitalize on its infrastructure in the United States and is actively aggregating oil and condensate volumes from independent producers, Weir told a company briefing, as carried by Reuters.While betting big on the rising U.S. oil production, Trafigura is looking to avoid the more burdensome and tighter commodity derivative trading regulations in Europe that come with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).So the trading house, which handles more than 5.2 million barrels of oil and petroleum products per day, has moved its hedging operations out of Europe and into the United States, Asia, and other locations.“We moved our hedging business away from Europe into the U.S. and Singapore and other locations,” Reuters quoted Trafigura CFO Christophe Salmon as saying at the same event.  For oil futures trading, MiFID II imposes tighter limits on positions to keep any one trader from having a very large position and therefore an undue influence over the futures market.Trafigura has been one of the most outspoken critics of the new MiFID II regulations in Europe, arguing that unnecessarily complex regulations would push derivatives trading away from the Continent.In oil trading in the United States, Trafigura says in its 2018 corporate brochure that its minority interest and exclusive commercial rights at the Buckeye Texas Partners (BTP) Corpus Christi terminal on the Texas Gulf Coast position it as a key player in the U.S. crude export market.  Related: Colombia’s Fracking DilemmaEarlier this year, Trafigura signed a long-term agreement to transport 300,000 bpd from the Permian to Corpus Christi via a pipeline expected to be operational in Q3 2019.Speaking at the briefing today, Trafigura’s CEO Weir and the co-head of market risk, Ben Luckock, expressed bullish views on oil in the medium term because the world will need more oil and there is shortage of new large-scale projects.“Peak demand is a long, long way away in the future. Shale oil is not a panacea for global oil production,” Weir noted, while Luckock said that “Permian cannot be the only solution to world oil supply while demand is growing by 1.7 million bpd. In the U.S. oil industry, it should be a marathon but people are running it at a sprint pace. They are doing an amazing job but growth is tiring in the Permian.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Trafigura-Leads-The-US-Oil-Export-Boom.html,"Mar 20, 2018 at 12:48 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Mar 20, 2018",Trafigura Leads The U.S. Oil Export Boom
2018-03-20,"At the good ship Clipper, we like to look at flows from two perspectives: sinks and sources. The sources are the main origins of the flows: The key exporting regions such as the Middle East, Latin America and West Africa. As for the sinks, they are key regions to which these barrels drain into.Asia continues to be an ever-growing sink for global crude flows, with waterborne discharge in the region clocking in at around 25 million barrels per day. While much has been made of rising U.S. crude exports into Asia of late, other regions in the Atlantic Basin have shown pockets of strength in the last year.Deliveries to Asia from the North Sea, the U.S. and West Africa averaged just under 3 million barrels per day in 2017, up by over a quarter on the prior year's volume.Part of last year's strength was to do with the ramp up in the availability of U.S. crude, egged on by rising domestic production, while another piece of the puzzle was the narrowing spread betwixt Brent and the Dubai/Oman benchmark amid the OPEC production cut - making North Sea crude a more attractive proposition. A similar trend for WTI-Dubai/Oman helped boost U.S. flows.Strength has continued this year, with deliveries to Asia from the three sources climbing above 3.5 million barrels per day again in January, for only the second time on our records.(Click to enlarge) While Nigeria and Angola continue to be the behemoths of West Africa in terms of production and exports, it has been loadings out of Congo (Brazzaville) to Asia which have provided the majority of the increase in flows from the region last year. The vast majority of exports are medium sweet Djeno blend, but there has also been exports of Azurite and Yombo (hark, heavy sour crude that we recently discussed here).  Related: Russia Struggles As Sanctions Choke Energy Sector(Click to enlarge) While some West African exporting nations are on the up, Angola looks set to face headwinds in the years ahead, given how production at its deep-water fields peaks swiftly, then declines thereafter.This would be a lesser concern if there were a consistent stream of new oil fields coming online, but instead we have seen lesser activity in recent years amid the lower oil price environment (highlighted by the rig count dropping to just 1, from a peak of 18 in 2014). Hark, waning production streams:(Click to enlarge) These production trends are affirmed by our ClipperData. The Olombendo crude stream sees sporadic exports, as does Sangos, while similar to the chart above, Clov exports are holding up just fine. But as for the older crude streams of medium sweet Pazflor and medium sour Saturno, both have indeed started their descent, affirming lower output:(Click to enlarge) By Matt SmithMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Europe-And-Africa-Boost-Oil-Exports-To-Asia.html,"Mar 20, 2018 at 10:44 | Matt Smith","Mar 20, 2018","U.S., Europe And Africa Boost Oil Exports To Asia"
