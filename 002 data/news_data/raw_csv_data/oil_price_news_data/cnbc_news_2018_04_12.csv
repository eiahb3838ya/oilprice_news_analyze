2018-04-12,"Uncertainty appears to have returned to oil markets of late, with a cluster of factors battling for influence over prices.The oil bulls are very content with the Vienna deal, its success (hitherto) and the prospects of another extension. The coming summer driving season is sure to boost this bullish sentiment as demand looks set to jump. Trump’s recent political reshuffle and the impact that may have on the termination of the Iran nuclear deal and the associated geopolitical tensions in the Middle-East add still more upside for prices.Oil bears can counter these arguments by questioning the longevity of the Vienna oil deal, pointing to the rising prospects of trade war between China and the U.S., and highlighting the incredible growth in U.S. shale production. For the rest of the year it will be the inter-play between these bullish and bearish factors that control where prices go.Let’s be honest. Of-late, bulls have largely dominated the market while bears appear to have gone into hiding. The bullish factors have been quite prominent in the news of late, and summer driving season is finally upon us. The summer driving season starts in April and ends in September with different peak periods. Millions of cars hit the road as families head out on vacation. This results in increased gasoline consumption, forcing refineries to consume more oil to meet the demand. In combination with other factors, the uptick in demand due to driving season will definitely provide some upside for oil prices.  Related: Is Oil Demand Growth Overrated?As well as driving season, Donald Trump’s administration will soon formally re-consider the Iran deal known as Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The sacking of National Security Adviser McMaster, who was replaced by John Bolton, has signaled that the administration is likely to take a more hawkish stance against Iran. It is well known that John Bolton has no taste for soft diplomacy. It is expected that on May 12th, 2018, the United States will likely cancel JCPOA. Oil prices spiked on the news of Bolton’s appointment and they will likely spike again if the agreement is indeed cancelled. However, it remains to be seen whether this will be a long term bullish factor for oil prices or if it is largely a sentiment driver.Both bulls and bears will be watching OPEC’s June meeting carefully. If the countries not only reiterate their commitment, which may include extending the deal till 2019, oil prices are likely to rally. However, if the meeting ends without action, or the common OPEC jawboning, it is likely that prices will fall. If whispers of an “exit” are heard, confidence in oil markets may drop dramatically and bears will likely come rushing back.What other factors should analysts look for when it comes to driving crude prices down in the coming year? One of the most notable is the brewing trade war between two of the biggest economic behemoths of the world: USA and China. As mentioned above, the increasingly hawkish U.S. administration may chance the face of U.S. foreign policy, and in this case it will likely be bearish for oil markets. Trump has proposed steel and aluminum tariffs (25 percent on former and 10 percent on latter). He is looking to impose a further $60 billion of tariffs in other areas. China quickly retaliated to these first sanctions – and has claimed that it will match Trump’s every step in this regard. Trump is now planning another $100 billion tariff plan for China. Talk of a fully blown trade war may be premature, but the first signs are certainly there. Oil prices have fallen each time that the trade war escalates, with one key consequence of a trade war being a fall in oil demand as U.S. exports to the world’s largest oil consumer fall. While the Iran wild card may threaten to push oil prices up – a trade war between China and the U.S. would have the opposite effect.Related: Strong Demand, Not OPEC, Is Pushing Oil Prices HigherAs with all discussions in global oil markets today, the remarkable growth of U.S. shale growth cannot be avoided. With production touching 10.5 mbpd and only growing, the downward pressure in markets from shale could be very significant in the right environment. The EIA says that US crude oil output will rise to 11.44 mbpd next year (a revision from 11.27 mbpd from last month). Fatih Birol, speaking during 16th International Energy Forum recently, said that “another wave of shale oil is on its way”, and added that, beyond the U.S., there will be growth in offshore production from Brazil and parts of Africa as well. This production is all being driven by the recent rise in oil prices, forming what could become a vicious circle for oil markets. One bit of good news that oil analysts can take from this however, is that U.S. firms appear to have learnt their lessons from the oil price crash. Shale companies have hedged a large portion of production and are finally becoming profitable for investors.Bulls and bears will continue to clash in the oil markets, and while bulls currently have the upper hand, it is unlikely they will maintain their dominance all year. Among the factors mentioned above, some are temporary (geopolitical), some are uncertain (OPEC) and some are more or less permanent (shale growth). Analysts should focus on trends, watching each of these factors and understanding how different outcomes may move markets.By Osama Rizvi for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Six-Factors-Driving-Oil-Markets-In-2018.html,"Apr 12, 2018 at 14:31 | Osama Rizvi","Apr 12, 2018",The Six Factors Driving Oil Markets In 2018
2018-04-12,"As it has become a trend in recent months, OPEC revised up again on Thursday its estimate for non-OPEC supply growth in 2018, but it also lifted its forecast for global oil demand growth, while it reported the cartel’s lowest crude oil production in a year in March.At the same day that OPEC published its MOMR, its Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters in an interview that he sees the oil market achieving balance in the second to third quarter this year, earlier than previously expected—at the end of 2018.“There is growing confidence that the declaration of cooperation will be extended beyond 2018,” Barkindo told Reuters.“Russia will continue to play a leading role,” he said, adding that OPEC and partners will discuss an initial draft of a longer-term cooperation framework at their meeting in June.In its closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report, OPEC revised up its expectation for non-OPEC supply this year by 80,000 bpd from the previous month’s assessment, on the back of higher-than-expected production in the first quarter, mostly in the United States and in the former Soviet Union. Non-OPEC supply is expected to rise by 1.71 million bpd year-on-year in 2018, compared with 900,000-bpd growth in 2017.Non-OPEC supply is “now expected to grow at a faster pace”, OPEC said, noting that the key driver is the U.S. with expected increase of 1.5 million bpd, followed by a distant second Canada with 290,000 bpd and Brazil with 210,000 bpd growth.

The cartel now expects global demand growth at 1.63 million bpd this year.“This mainly reflects the positive momentum in the OECD in the 1Q18 on the back of better-than-expected data, and supported by development in industrial activities, colder than-anticipated weather and strong mining activities in the OECD Americas and the OECD Asia Pacific,” OPEC said in its report, which is more upbeat about demand growth than the March MOMR.Total oil consumption this year is seen at 98.70 million bpd with total world oil demand breaking a historical threshold of 100 million bpd in Q4, OPEC said today.The OECD commercial oil stocks—whose five-year average OPEC is officially targeting in the production cut deal—were 43 million barrels above the latest five-year average, according to preliminary data for February. Crude stocks indicated a surplus of 55 million barrels, while product stocks were in a deficit of 12 million barrels below the five-year average, OPEC estimates.OPEC’s crude oil production for March dropped by 201,400 bpd compared to February, to average 31.96 million bpd, according to OPEC’s secondary sources. This was the cartel’s lowest production in one year, as Venezuela’s output continued to plummet (down 55,300 bpd over February); Saudi Arabia cut 46,900 bpd from its February level; and Angola and Libya also registered big declines. The UAE, on the other hand, boosted production by 44,900 bpd from February, secondary sources data showed.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Three-Takeaways-From-OPECs-Latest-Report.html,"Apr 12, 2018 at 10:38 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Apr 12, 2018",Three Takeaways From OPEC's Latest Report
2018-04-12,"New Zealand’s government has announced all oil and gas exploration offshore the country will be banned in a bid to protect New Zealand from the effects of climate change. The ban, however, will not extend to existing exploration projects.There are more than 30 active licenses in New Zealand at the moment, of which 22 are for offshore blocks. The country is far from a major oil producer, which will probably facilitate its transition to a carbon-neutral economy by 2050, before that achieving 100 percent renewable power generation by 2035.However, as Radio NZ notes, the holders of existing exploration permits will keep the right to turn these into production licenses, so theoretically, fossil fuel extraction in eco-friendly New Zealand could continue for another few decades despite transition efforts.Also, the ban does not cover onshore oil and gas exploration, so permit issuance for onshore blocks will continue.The energy industry slammed the government for banning offshore exploration while environmentalists praised it. The Petroleum Exploration & Production Association of New Zealand protested the lack of consultation with industry representatives before the decision was made, with chief executive Cameron Madgwick telling media ""It shows a complete misunderstanding by the government of how our industry works ... these are multi-decadal decisions, there are people here today that are looking forward to the future and what that might look like for their business, the planning around that indeed the equipment that might be needed.""

The country usually holds a tender every year with the last two ones resulting in the awarding of one exploration block each.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/New-Zealand-Bans-Offshore-Oil-Exploration.html,"Apr 12, 2018 at 09:23 | Irina Slav","Apr 12, 2018",New Zealand Bans Offshore Oil Exploration
