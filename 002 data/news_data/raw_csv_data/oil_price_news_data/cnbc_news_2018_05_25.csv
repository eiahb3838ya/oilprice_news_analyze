2018-05-25,"I have updated my scenarios for U.S. LTO output, based on both EIA tight oil output data and average well profile data from Enno Peters’ shaleprofile.com. I have also created a scenario for the Niobrara shale oil play and for “other U.S. LTO” which excludes the Permian Basin LTO, Eagle Ford, North Dakota Bakken/Three Forks, and the Niobrara.(Click to enlarge)niobrara playThe recent Niobrara wells have an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of 143 kb. The oil price scenario below is used for all of the scenarios.(Click to enlarge)Well cost is assumed to be $4.5 million in 2017$. The scenario below assumes EUR starts to decrease in Jan 2019 as sweet spots become fully drilled. Economically recoverable resources (ERR) to 2040 are 2.7 Gb with 21,000 total oil wells completed, peak output is 623 kb/d in early 2021.Related: OPEC May Ease Oil Cuts As Soon As JuneFewer wells are completed relative to the North Dakota Bakken and Permian Basin because the wells are less profitable.(Click to enlarge)other u.s. ltoFor U.S. other LTO, much of the output is from condensate from gas wells so the analysis is more approximate and a discounted cash flow analysis is beyond the scope of this post, the “average well” produces only about 38 kb over its life, but in many cases the output of natural gas makes the well profitable, there are some areas where shaleprofile.com does not have data such as the Anadarko basin, so I have simply taken the average well profile for areas covered (excluding ND Bakken, Eagle Ford, Permian and Niobrara) and then found the number of these “average wells” that fit U.S. other LTO output data from the EIA (including Anadarko). The true average well profile for all areas including Anadarko is unknown.The scenario below should be considered very preliminary, actual output might be much higher or lower than suggested by this scenario. TRR is 3 Gb from 70,000 wells completed and peak output is 426 kb/d in mid-2020. For comparison U.S. other LTO output was 385 k/d in Feb 2018, so increased output from other U.S. LTO plays may be quite small in magnitude.(Click to enlarge)north dakota bakken scenario(Click to enlarge)eagle ford scenario(Click to enlarge)The ROI for Eagle Ford wells is much lower than Permian or Bakken wells which accounts for wells added per month remaining far below the peak level, ERR=8.2 Gb with 33,000 total wells completed, in Jan 2020 output is 1277 kb/d. Like the ND Bakken and Permian scenarios, it is assumed for the Eagle Ford that new well EUR starts to decrease in Jan 2019.permian basin ltoERR is 28 Gb through 2040 with 103,000 wells completed, peak is 4246 kb/d in 2024.(Click to enlarge)For all U.S. LTO we add up these 5 scenarios to get the chart below.Related: Oil Slides As Saudis, Russia Consider 1 Million Bpd Output BoostPeak is 8152 in July 2022, URR to 2050 is 54 Gb.(Click to enlarge)Chart below shows the contribution of the various plays to the total (horizontal axis ends in 2041 rather than 2050).(Click to enlarge)The scenario presented above lines up with the USGS mean estimates for the Permian Basin and North Dakota Bakken and David Hughes most likely scenario for the Eagle Ford in terms of URR. Reasonable guesses for the Niobrara and other U.S. LTO were made based on EIA tight output data and well data from shaleprofile.com and these will be updated as more information becomes available. Higher or lower scenarios could be created with URR from 45 to 65 Gb and peak years between 2020 and 2025 and peak output between 7000 and 9000 kb/d. In my view, U.S. LTO has about an 80% probability of falling within the low and high scenarios outlined above.More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Shale-Production-May-Be-Plateauing.html,"May 25, 2018 at 17:05 | Ron Patterson","May 25, 2018",U.S. Shale Production May Be Plateauing
2018-05-25,"Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has promised to start increasing the crisis-stricken country’s oil production during his second six-year term in office.AFP reports that during his inauguration speech, Maduro said he will seek the help of OPEC to double Venezuela’s oil production, which is currently at 70-year lows and much below its production quota under the OPEC cut agreement. Maduro said the current production rate—about 1.5 million bpd—would need to increase by 1 million barrels daily by the end of this year.Further in his speech, Maduro said that Venezuela will defeat the U.S. sanctions and its economy will reverse its course to a more positive one, admitting, however, that it will be a tough job because of the sanctions and the ruinous state of its oil industry.""I cannot deceive anyone, they are going to create serious difficulties for us, painful difficulties, that we will face gradually -- we will defeat them. Trump's sanctions will be nullified and defeated,"" Maduro said.Venezuela has been teetering on the brink of collapse for months now, and the thing that could push it over the edge would be further sanctions from the U.S, whether banning Venezuelan oil exports to Gulf Coast refineries or U.S. light crude exports to Venezuela, which it needs to mix its heavy crude with lighter grades to make it marketable.President Trump has made it clear that both those options are on the table as he seeks to punish the Caracas regime.If the United States were to slap sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry, it could accelerate its already swift decline. In April, Venezuela lost 41,700 bpd of oil production and its output averaged 1.436 million bpd, according to OPEC’s secondary sources. This compares to average oil production of 2.154 million bpd for 2016 and to 1.911 million bpd for 2017, and was the lowest production level since 1949.By Irina Slav For Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Maduro-Vows-To-Double-Oil-Production-With-Help-From-OPEC.html,"May 25, 2018 at 10:39 | Irina Slav","May 25, 2018",Maduro Vows To Double Oil Production With Help From OPEC
