2018-02-02,"U.S. crude oil inventories jumped this past week for the first time in nearly three months, rising by 6.7 million barrels. The inventory increase, coming at a time of surging U.S. oil production, could rattle the oil price rally. However, the stock builds were always expected, and are typical at this time of year.The jump in inventories put an end to 10 consecutive weeks of inventory drawdowns, which have the stock surplus within sight of the five-year average. That could test the oil price rally, which has sputtered in the last few weeks with Brent at about $70 per barrel and WTI in the mid-$60s.(Click to enlarge)But refineries tend to head into maintenance in February and March, retooling ahead of warmer months when demand usually rises. And as most major analysts have predicted (including the IEA, EIA and OPEC), the stock build was expected.The inventory increase came not coincidentally in a week in which refinery inputs dropped significantly, falling from 17 million barrels per day (mb/d) for the week ending on January 19, to 16.67 mb/d for the week ending on January 26 (4-week averages). As refineries throttle back, the pull on crude oil from inventories declines.But at least according to the most recent data, the trend isn’t overwhelmingly bearish. Standard Chartered noted that the increase in inventories was not even that large on a seasonal basis, and it was less than the five-year average (although the past five years have included several years of extraordinary stock increases, so the “average” is somewhat misleading). While stocks increased on an absolute basis, they didn’t really increase against that five-year average.Adding a bit more comfort to oil bulls was the “counter-seasonal draw in gasoline and another sharp draw at Cushing that took inventories below their five-year range,” Standard Chartered wrote in a note. Lower refining runs might mean a diminishing effect on crude demand, but it also means that refineries won’t be stashing so much gasoline into storage. The EIA said that gasoline stocks fell in the most recent week by 1.9 million barrels.  Related: Oil Markets Are At A StalemateIn other words, the stock build is not the bearish news that it might seem, particular because it was widely expected to crop up at some point in the first quarter.Moreover, the U.S. is only part of the picture. Stocks have been declining around the world, not least because production outside of North America is flat — and in some countries, falling by quite a bit.“Ultimately, we think the U.S. market is a little bit of a smokescreen actually for the oil industry, with ongoing supply issues elsewhere and also the strong demand, really tightening up this market and further, I suppose, reducing that global inventory glut that OPEC has been targeting for some time,” Daniel Hynes of ANZ told CNBC.Indeed, Goldman Sachs stated that it believes the rebalancing effort is already here. Instead of just looking at U.S. inventories, OPEC is targeting inventories across the OECD. U.S. oil production is surging, which will push up inventories for a good part of this year, but that isn’t the case elsewhere. Even that data omits what is going on in the non-OECD, where demand is growing at a much faster clip.Goldman Sachs says the timespreads in the futures market implies that inventories are currently much lower than many people think. OECD stock data is published with a longer lag time, and while it will take time to see a clearer picture, the investment bank estimates that the long-awaited point of rebalancing has arrived. OPEC will keep the cuts in place, and the market will probably tighten well below the five-year average before that is reflected in the data. This is why the bank sees Brent going above $80 per barrel in the next six months.Nevertheless, the oil market will have a murky picture for a little while longer. The market is tightening, and many expect it to tighten particularly in the second half of this year, but the expected increase in U.S. crude inventories over the next few weeks and months will muddy the waters. Oil traders will see soaring U.S. oil production and inventory builds as a sign that the market tightening has slowed. And indeed, with the preponderance of speculative positions on the bullish side, there is downside risk.But last week’s inventory increase, and the stock builds to come, don’t necessarily mean that we’re in for another protracted downturn.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Will-Rising-Crude-Inventories-End-The-Rally.html,"Feb 02, 2018 at 17:51 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 02, 2018",Will Rising Crude Inventories End The Rally?
2018-02-02,"Venezuela’s oil production continues to plummet, and some of the dire production scenarios for the South American nation are no longer looking as remote as they once were.OPEC compliance remained elevated in January, halting a slide in oil prices even as new data reveals soaring production growth from U.S. shale. OPEC compliance hit 138 percent in January, essentially the same as December. Nigeria and Saudi Arabia actually raised their oil production levels in January from a month earlier. But the reason that OPEC was able to avoid a slide in its compliance rate is that Venezuela continues to see its production base erode at a rapid clip.The reasons for the decline are the same as they have been for quite a while: an economic crisis that is only worsening, no cash for investment or even maintenance, a debt crisis, U.S. sanctions, the politicization of PDVSA and a brain drain from the company. “Unfortunately, these factors are not going away, which means Venezuela’s output and political situation will likely remain in a downward spiral during 2018,” Barclays analysts wrote in a research note.The investment bank predicts that Venezuela’s oil production will average 1.43 million barrels per day (mb/d) in 2018, a shocking decline of roughly 700,000 bpd from the 2017 average. In the second half of 2018, output averages just 1.35 mb/d.The situation is compounded by a spiraling debt crisis. For years, Venezuela and PDVSA have prioritized meeting bond payments pretty much above all else, even a worsening humanitarian crisis playing out in the streets. People go hungry, want for basic items, and die in hospitals that lack medicine. Yet creditors continued to be paid, at least up until a few months ago. The fear has been that once PDVSA defaults on major bond payments, creditors could go after oil assets around the world that would make the situation much worse for the country.  Related: Three Factors That Could End The Oil RallyAs such, Venezuela could try to continue to pay creditors what it can. The problem, however, is that the government is fighting on too many fronts. Because it has no cash to even fund the most basic maintenance at its oil fields and refineries, production is now in steep decline. That will make its cash situation even worse with each passing day, which in turn will make meeting debt payments more difficult. “[I]f production continues to fall at the recent accelerated pace, the government’s runway to pay upcoming obligations will be severely shortened,” Barclays analysts wrote.The only way the situation can be reversed, Barclays says, is a change of government. “We believe sustainably growing output would likely require a combination of the following: a regime change, FX reforms, adjustments to fiscal terms, changes to PDVSA’s equity mandate, and higher oil prices,” Barclays wrote. That is a serious set of circumstances that is unlikely to play out anytime soon. So, the declines continue.The accelerated decline in the fourth quarter suggests that actual shut-ins could be occurring, Barclays says, but data and intel on what’s taking place at the ground level is hard to come by.  Related: JP Morgan: Oil Could Hit $78 Within MonthsStill, while the situation for Venezuela’s oil industry is dreadful, much of the declines that Barclays is forecasting have already happened. The bank’s headline figure of a loss of 700,000 bpd from Venezuela this year is based on the 2017 average (2.18 mb/d), not what the country produced at the end of the year (around 1.6-1.75 mb/d). In other words, if Venezuela can exit 2018 at about 1.35 mb/d or a little below, the 2018 losses, at least in the global context, wouldn’t be that massive.On the other hand, Barclays noted that there is some downside risk to even this dire forecast. There is a “possibility of a sharper decline due to the creditors’ decision to attach assets, accelerated debt payments, or a further escalation of political tensions,” the bank said. “In the event of a sudden, significant supply disruption (1-1.5 mb/d), we would expect prices to rally 5–10 percent over the near term, though a sustained outage could strengthen prices further.” However, any sudden loss of such a great magnitude would likely prompt higher production from OPEC in order to prevent a painful price spike.No matter how you slice it, Venezuela’s oil production is heading south. The uncertainty is around how bad it will be.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/How-Far-Can-Venezuelas-Oil-Production-Fall.html,"Feb 02, 2018 at 17:40 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 02, 2018",How Far Can Venezuela’s Oil Production Fall
2018-02-02,"Canadian oil and gas drillers are moving their rigs to the United States in response to greater demand for their service there and an investment climate at home that is, according to industry insiders, only making their lives harder.In a recent story for The Globe and Mail, Dan Healing quotes a few executives from drilling companies who say they’re taking rigs to the Permian in Texas, and the exodus will likely intensify, even if not all drillers are too comfortable with the move so far to the south.One of these executives, Trinidad Drilling’s CEO Brent Conway, put it in simple terms: ""We've raised taxes, we're increasing costs because of labour laws that are changing, we aren't building pipelines and we can't get federal or provincial governments to do anything to help us.""Meanwhile in the Lower 48, drillers are getting closer to the 10-million-bpd mark by the day, despite warnings that they might “drill themselves into the ground” if they don’t rein in production growth. These words, spoken last year by Continental Resources’ Harold Hamm, rang out across the industry when benchmarks were just beginning to recover. But now, with Brent still very close to $70 a barrel and WTI enjoying a lift to $66, it’s easy to forget them, so shale boomers are drilling and hedging their future production at the higher prices. For them, life seems to be good.For Canadian drillers, not so much. A lack of pipeline capacity seems to be the most pressing problem. It is not a new problem. It has been around for years, and even in 2015, Canadian media reported warnings that the discount at which Canadian crude trades to West Texas Intermediate will only widen if no new pipelines are built, and this will hurt the performance of the local oil industry.  Related: The Biggest Threat To U.S. Oil ExportsThings haven’t changed for the better since then. Keystone XL has not yet received a final investment decision as doubts persist about it being economical, and environmental opposition remains strong. Trans Mountain’s expansion — a project that the federal government of Justin Trudeau approved last year — is also far from certain as the government of British Columbia has put its foot down, vowing to do whatever it takes to shelve the project forever.Western Canadian Select (WCS) is currently trailing WTI prices by a discount of more than $30 a barrel. That’s a very wide gap, and even PM Trudeau seems to be aware of it because at a recent town hall meeting in Edmonton, he said that Canadian crude needs new markets and therefore needs the Trans Mountain expansion to reach the coast of British Columbia. Yet there was no cheer at the meeting. Opposition to the project, to all pipeline projects in Canada, is riding the high wave of saving the planet, oblivious to questions like where the more than 100,000 people now working in oil and gas in Alberta alone are going to go and what is going to replace the industry’s contribution to the provincial and federal GDP.This contribution may not be 50 percent, as it is in much more oil-dependent economies, but it is there. Until the pipeline problem is solved, more drillers will leave for the Permian and the rigs, according to the industry executives that spoke to The Globe and Mail, may never come back.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-US-Oil-Boom-Is-Attracting-Canadian-Drillers.html,"Feb 02, 2018 at 17:40 | Irina Slav","Feb 02, 2018",The U.S. Oil Boom Is Attracting Canadian Drillers
2018-02-02,"EIA reservesEIA provides estimates of proved reserves based on information from the E&Ps on form EIA-23 for crude only, and also shows the categories for changes (discoveries, production, revisions etc.). This data with updates for 2016 has been due since November but so far has been twice delayed. BOEM make their own estimates for 2P (i.e. proved and probable) based on strict adherence to SEC/SPE rules (i.e. the reserve must be on production or be expected to be produced within five years). I think this usually comes out in May. In the absence of the latest EIA numbers I’ve presented the 2015 numbers with adjustments for subsequent production. There will be revisions and additional discoveries to include once the actual data is available though I think fairly small, especially for gas, but it will be interesting to see.(Click to enlarge) Despite excluding probable reserves and counting crude only, the EIA estimates have recently exceeded those from BOEM. It looks like a lot of the probable reserves were converted to proved through positive revisions in the period 2008 to 2011; i.e. possibly due to some price increases then, but also immediately following the SEC rule changes to exclude reserves without firm development plans, which may or may not be coincidental: the E&Ps may be less strict on applying the SEC/SPE rule, which they are allowed to do for large, long term projects. The BOEM estimates are pretty much flat over recent years as additions (which then become backdated “discoveries”) from new projects going through FID balance production, whereas EIA estimates are declining with revisions recently zero to negative.(Click to enlarge)Sales and acquisitions mostly balance out, sometimes with a year or so lag, though overall slightly positive, which I guess means the purchasers are able to get a bit more from the fields than the sellers. There are few extensions to conventional fields (unlike LTO where they are the largest positive factor) and discoveries have trended down significantly over the last three or four years (this would probably have happened a couple of years earlier but for the drilling hiatus caused by the Deep Horizon accident).c&c productionFor November the production losses from Hurricane Nate have been recovered but more than 100 kbpd streamday was lost because of the subsea connector failure on LLOG Delta House Rigel template and the Shell Enchilada gas line failure. Total oil by BOEM was 1675 kbpd (up 211 kbpd m-o-m but down 16 kbpd y-o-y) and by EIA 1666 kbpd (up 209 kbpd from October, but down 21 kbpd y-o-y). Note that several leases did not report November numbers so I have had to estimate production based on data from the months before the hurricanes started to have influence.(Click to enlarge) New fields production has peaked for the time being, even allowing for the offline fields. Stampede might give it another boost once it comes on-line soon. The smaller additions are generally in decline, but there has been some in-fill additions for Horn Mountain, Holstein and Phoenix.(Click to enlarge) The large platforms, and Mars-Ursa should be considered with the ones listed, are holding and increasing production the best. I don’t know how much more there is to come, but certainly Tahiti and Atlantis have large brownfield developments in progress. The larger ones shown are around ten years old, which would normally be seeing the end of a plateau period, but equally they tend to have a lot of excess processing capacity. If nothing else some of them must be due for major turn-arounds in the next couple of years, which would take about as much production out for a year as Nate did.(Click to enlarge) The smaller, mature fields took a hit with Enchilada offline, but maybe not as big as might be expected given their continuing steep decline.(Click to enlarge) Shallow fields continue to decline. There was some headline news with Byron drilling the South Marsh Island 71 block, but it only has about 4,500 bpd capacity. recent news and activityThe Enchilada pipeline is still offline with no date for restart published yet, which is keeping about 75 kbpd oil production offline from Baldpate, Salsa, Cardamom and Magnolia since early November. The workers injured in the incident have started proceedings against Shell for compensation due to safety failings. All these fields were in fairly steep decline so the production, and therefore revenue and interest, is only lost while they are offline rather than being deferred several years as would be the case for a system on plateau. The subsea failure on the Rigel manifold feeding Delta House has resulted in Rigel, Otis and Son of Bluto 2 being off line for most of October and all of November (about 40 kbpd capacity). I have seen no news that this has been repaired. Without these two major unplanned outages November would just about have beaten the March record for production.Anadarko relinquished the Phobos lease after poor appraisal well results. It had been the only qualified lease in the far south Sigsbee Escarpment lease area and was being planned as a long tie-back to Lucius.  Related: The Oil Market Is Already BalancedMaersk Drilling have lain off workers that had been working on the Maersk Viking for ExxonMobil’s Julia field, which seems to have finished although there had been plans for a phase II there. It had been in quite steep decline but there has been about 6,000 bpd increase in the flow over the last two months and it may be near a new peak. Stones drilling has also stopped, it has a nameplate of 40 kbpd but has only so far exceeded 30 for one month. Heidelberg drilling too, has now stopped and it has achieved about 40 kbpd of a nameplate of 70 kbpd; phase II is due in 2021.Tornado II started production in mid-December at about 10 kbpd oil. Combined flow for Tornado/Phoenix is currently reported at about 21 kbpd oil, or net 8,000 bpd up on the average for Tornado I alone. There’s also been a big increase in the Horn Mountain lease, which has gone from less than 10 kbpd and declining in May, to now over 32 kbpd.Two non-quantified discoveries have been announced as variously “major”, “significant” and “amongst our biggest”: Whale for Shell/Chevron, which does sound pretty big and is near the Perdido platform, and Ballymore for Chevron/Total, which is near Blind Faith. I suspect both will be tie-backs as the reason for concentrating on near field exploration was to save money on subsequent developments. Perdido has 100 kbpd nameplate and currently produces 66 kbpd, and Blind Faith has 60 kbpd with over 37 kbpd capacity available, and rising. Appraisal drilling is continuing on both, and that hasn’t always been as great as the initial announcements (e.g. Kaskida, Shenendoah and, recently, Phobos). I’m not certain but think they both may count against last year’s discoveries and the announcements have been delayed to be immediately before the 2017 financial statements.Wood Mackenzie was reported as giving predicted 2018 GoM deep-water production of 1935 kboepd, a new record. I think this is an average rather than a peak or exit rate, but I couldn’t find for sure. Note this is oil and gas (reported as including 80 percent C&C, I think, but could be total liquids) and doesn’t include shallow water, which may be below 500’ (common industry limit) or 1000’ (BOEM limit) the report didn’t say. I don’t know why it was made so complicated, probably so they can declare a record of some kind which would help or try and sell the full report.Currently (early February) there are forty-nine deep-water well related operations in progress reported by BSEE. Thirty-four are drilling related, with five pre-drilling for future projects and four on unnamed fields (so wildcats or appraisals). Of the fifteen running tools one is for P&A on Tick, which is fairly shallow water. Numbers in brackets on the production charts show the number of listed activities for each field. There is no current indication that the increased oil price is leading to increased drilling and the Baker Hughes count of active rigs has actually fallen slightly recently, though there may be signs of an uptick in non near field wildcats, but probably still early to say.future production scenariosBelow is an updated projected scenario (i.e. guess) for future production. The total production in each section equals the estimated reserves for those fields from BOEM numbers for January 2016 less any production since then. Their estimates for this year (showing January 2017 numbers) have not yet been issued. For projects under development and discoveries I’ve used the E&P numbers for reserves, production and start-up where available or just made a guess. Numbers in brackets are nominal crude and condensate nameplate capacity for the expected development. I’ve included some nominal new discoveries with total reserves of 500 mmbbls, but may have to change that once the Whale numbers are announced.I’ve also shown the 2018 BOEM production forecast, which I don’t fully understand. For instance they have on-line production suddenly dropping about 400 kbpd this year, but being made up with contingent numbers, which I would have assumed is possible development but can’t be; but also can’t be planned start-ups because there is nothing like that amount due this year. They also have a large amount of new discoveries that come on line very quickly – i.e. ten years to bring on line 800 kbpd, which would be some combination between eight big discoveries and eighty smaller tie backs. Nothing in recent history of exploration success or lease sales, or usual cycle times for deep-water projects, would suggest that is likely.(Click to enlarge)EIA STEO has its normal steady exponential rise, now extended through 2019, with bites out for hurricane season.(Click to enlarge)By Peakoilbarrel.comMore Top Read From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Can-We-Expect-A-Rise-In-Gulf-Of-Mexico-Oil-Production.html,"Feb 02, 2018 at 17:26 | Ron Patterson","Feb 02, 2018",Can We Expect A Rise In Gulf Of Mexico Oil Production?
2018-02-02,"Back in December we discussed how US oil inventories had been drawn down by a hundred million barrels from their peak last March, channeling Dr Evil from Austin Powers.In recent weeks we have been on tour, presenting our six-month proprietary outlook, and have been highlighting the case of another 100 million barrels - this time via the cumulative drop in Saudi crude exports over the last year.The chart below shows the cumulative drop in OPEC exports in 2017 versus the October 2016 reference level. It highlights that OPEC on the aggregate reduced imports by a total of ~180 million barrels (meeelion barrels) last year.Breaking down that 180 million-barrel drop, Saudi Arabia accounted for about 100 million barrels - the driving force behind the rebalancing effort.While others also showed compliance with the OPEC production cut deal by cutting exports (such as Kuwait and Angola) these efforts were offset by rising exports elsewhere from the likes of Libya and Nigeria. On the aggregate, OPEC members minus Saudi accounted for just under half the drop in exports last year:(Click to enlarge) Libya, who wasn't part of the OPEC production cut deal, increased crude exports last year by an average of nearly 300,000 bpd versus October 2016's reference level. This essentially canceled out the export cut by Saudi Arabia (albeit, a swap of heavier crude for lighter barrels - a key theme in the global crude market).Libyan crude exports peaked in October, before geopolitical tension in the region scuppered production once more. Production at oil fields in the Jikharra area, which flows to the ports of Zueitina and Ras Lanuf, were impacted in early November due to protests. Exports out of Ras Lanuf accordingly dropped to a six-month low in November, and to a five-month low out of Zueitina in December.Following this, there have been an increasing number of incidents ratcheting up tension in the region - from worker abductions to fuel shortages to heavy clashes.One of the biggest influences on crude flows, however, came from an attack on the Waha pipeline in late December, which caused a production loss estimated at 70,000 - 100,000 bpd. The pipeline was repaired in early January, and flows have rebounded again.(Click to enlarge) We here at the good ship ClipperData have a new product, which combines algorithmic data mining and quantitative impact analysis to help our clients separate signal from noise.

2018-02-02,"Russia’s crude oil production in January was basically flat compared to December 2017, after rising production at foreign firm-led projects compensated for small declines at the two major Russian oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil.According to data by Russia’s Energy Ministry, Russian oil production in January was 46.306 million tons, or 10.95 million bpd, just slightly less than 46.338 million tons in December 2017.The January crude oil production is in line with Russia’s pledge in the OPEC/non-OPEC deal is to shave off 300,000 bpd from its October 2016 level, which was the country’s highest monthly production in almost 30 years—11.247 million bpd.Russia’s cut in its January production was 301,200 bpd, as part of the pact between OPEC and the Russia-led alliance of non-OPEC nations, Energy Minister Alexander Novak says.Crude oil production from Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) projects last month increased by more than 10 percent, while production at Rosneft and Lukoil fell by 0.2 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively, according to the energy ministry data quoted by Reuters.  The Sakhalin-1 project led by Exxon had plans to increase production in January to 250,000 bpd-260,000 bpd from 200,000 bpd last year and had a preliminary approval to do this. But Russian authorities have ordered the project to return in January to the previous--lower--production rate, industry sources told Reuters last week. The Sakhalin-1 project will continue to operate under the 200,000-bpd quota until Russian authorities finish the approval of a new plan for production, a source close to the Energy Ministry told Reuters.
