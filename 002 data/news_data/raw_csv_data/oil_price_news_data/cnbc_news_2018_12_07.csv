2018-12-07,"Oil prices spiked on Friday on news from Vienna.OPEC+ managed to pull off an eleventh-hour agreement, checking all the boxes after a contentious set of meetings. There were a lot of competing interests at play, but the agreement offers a little bit of everything, enough for all parties to walk away satisfied.The headliner is the 1.2 million-barrel-per-day (mb/d) cut beginning in January, with a review scheduled for April. OPEC will shoulder 800,000 bpd of the total, and non-OPEC countries will take on the other 400,000 bpd. The baseline used to measure the cuts is October production levels.The cut is larger than some analysts had expected, especially given the rumors swirling on Thursday about a cut of around 1 mb/d. In fact, one could argue that the group cleverly managed market expectations, lowering them on Thursday only to surprise the market with a larger cut on Friday. Prior to the meeting 1.2 mb/d might have been considered a middle-of-the-road cut, but after the seemingly tumultuous set of meetings on Thursday and early Friday, a 1.2 mb/d cut ends up looking like a highly successful result.Iran had held up the talks early Friday. Saudi Arabia pushed for them to agree to a symbolic cut, an odd position given that Iran’s output at this point is far below capacity and far below its prior ceiling. Iran, with good reason, argued that it should not have to sign on to any cuts, especially since sanctions are likely going to curtail output even further in the months ahead.The rumors on Friday were that the holdup could sink a deal, but that was never going to be the case. It’s extremely hard to imagine Saudi Arabia walking away from a deal that included meaningful cuts from other producers just because Iran wouldn’t symbolically cut their output.

All countries appear to be participants in the deal, but there won’t be country-specific quotas. Iran did not receive an official “exemption,” some OPEC officials argued, even as the Iranians claimed they did. Other officials said that there would be “special considerations.” This point is a matter of splitting hairs – Iran’s production is likely to fall in the coming months; it doesn’t really matter what they call it. That’s also why this issue was not going to be the thing that sunk the entire deal.Oil prices spiked on the news, with Brent up around 5 percent immediately after the agreement was announced.Russia, as expected, played a pivotal role in the deal, and its willingness to go along with a larger-than-expected cut was the key factor in the 1.2 mb/d reduction (although Russia’s precise contribution was not known at the time of this writing).The deal can be called a success for two reasons. First, it takes 1.2 mb/d off of the market beginning in January, which will go a long way to erasing the surplus. Second, it removes a great deal of uncertainty about what to expect in the near future. Oil prices have been all over the map in the last few months, with Saudi production surging at a time when U.S. shale was also defying expectations. Now, it’s reasonable to assume that any surplus or deficit won’t be so large as to lead to dramatic price swings, at least in the short run.  Related: Could Iraq Be The Next OPEC Member To Exit?However, the one remaining piece of uncertainty is how, or if, the U.S. government will react. President Trump has repeatedly demanded low oil prices, and tweeted as recently as Wednesday to that effect. Typically, OPEC would not be all that sensitive to Trump’s demands, but Saudi Arabia is reeling after the international outrage over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. A bipartisan movement in Washington is upping the pressure on Riyadh, and Trump has been one of the few friends Saudi Arabia has left.If oil prices rise too much, Trump might lash out and dump the Saudis, although what that means in practice is very much unclear. Due to extreme budgetary pressure from low oil prices, Saudi Arabia had no choice but to risk Trump’s ire and push for meaningfully supply curbs.For now, OPEC+ is likely patting themselves on the back. They reached an agreement that is mostly acceptable to everyone, oil prices are up, the surplus will narrow significantly and uncertainty is greatly diminished.Notably, the agreement calls for a review in April. The timing is not coincidental – U.S. waivers granted to eight countries importing Iranian oil expire in May. By April, everyone will know much more about what direction Washington intends to go in, and how much oil Iran will lose. If Iranian exports are rapidly falling to zero, OPEC+ would have time to unwind the production cuts.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Succeeds-Whats-Next-For-Oil.html,"Dec 07, 2018 at 16:49 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 07, 2018","OPEC+ Succeeds, What’s Next For Oil?"
2018-12-07,"This week the United States Geological Survey (USGS) announced a groundbreaking oil and gas discovery in West Texas’ Permian Basin. According to the organization’s recent press release, a whopping 46.3 billion barrels of oil, 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 20 billion barrels of natural gas liquids are now believed to lie untapped in the Wolfcamp Shale and overlying Bone Spring Formation area of Texas and New Mexico’s Permian Basin.Major players in the energy industry already have a significant presence in Wolfcamp and Bone Spring, including Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Pioneer Natural Resources Co. It was already well known and well documented that these fields were remarkably fertile grounds for oil extraction, but the jaw-dropping extent of the new figures released this week by the USGS has made the massive crude and shale reserves of the Permian Basin freshly headline-worthy. The figures in this week’s press release are in fact, in the case of Wolfcamp Shale, more than double the previous resource assessment.(Click to enlarge) Source: USGSThe USGS assessed the area more than two years ago in 2016, and has officially determined that it contained the largest estimated quantity of continuous oil in the entire United States. ""Christmas came a few weeks early this year,"" said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke in response to these momentous figures. ""American strength flows from American energy, and as it turns out, we have a lot of American energy. Before this assessment came down, I was bullish on oil and gas production in the United States. Now, I know for a fact that American energy dominance is within our grasp as a nation.""  Related: Is This The Next Big Petrochemical Hub In The U.S.?The USGS qualifies the figures of their massive discovery as consisting of undiscovered, technically recoverable resources, which they define as, ""those [resources] that are estimated to exist based on geologic knowledge and already established production, while technically recoverable resources are those that can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices. Whether or not it is profitable to produce these resources has not been evaluated.""The continued productivity and massive untapped resources present in the Permian Basin are particularly vital to the United States energy industry, in a time that most shale wells are in steep decline after years of record booms and cheap crude-flooded markets. Now, in addition to this stunning discovery from the USGS, there is even further hope that there are still additional technically recoverable resources lying in wait, yet to be discovered.Dr. Jim Reilly, the Director of USGS, a facet of the U.S. Department of Interior, highlighted how remarkable the discovery was in the larger context of the industry. “In the 1980’s, during my time in the petroleum industry, the Permian and similar mature basins were not considered viable for producing large new recoverable resources. Today, thanks to advances in technology, the Permian Basin continues to impress in terms of resource potential. The results of this most recent assessment and that of the Wolfcamp Formation in the Midland Basin in 2016 are our largest continuous oil and gas assessments ever released.” Reilly stressed, “Knowing where these resources are located and how much exists is crucial to ensuring both our energy independence and energy dominance.”Additionally, these discoveries come at a particularly opportune time for West Texas, as a major injection of funding has just been provided toward infrastructure the West Texas area via a federal grant supported by U.S. Senator John Cornyn. The grant, which comes from a program led by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (B.U.I.L.D.) will direct money to infrastructure projects in Winkler, Glasscock and Reagan Counties.The recent discovery and continued investment in the Permian Basin shows that the industry continues to be bullish in West Texas, and with good reason, despite the volatility of the oil industry as a whole. While other major fields continue to decline in production, the Permian Basin has managed to stay above the fray and certainly shows no sign of slowing.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Real-Implications-Of-The-New-Permian-Estimates.html,"Dec 07, 2018 at 16:37 | Haley Zaremba","Dec 07, 2018",The Real Implications Of The New Permian Estimates
2018-12-07,"U.S. West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil soared on Friday as investors breathe a sigh of relief as OPEC and its partners decided to cut 1.2 million bpd.On Thursday, Saudi Arabia took the wind out of the sail of the bullish traders when its oil minister said it would be happy with a production cut of about 1 million barrels per day. Prior to the comment from the Saudi’s, the market had been pricing in a cut in output of up to 1.4 million barrels per day.The daily chart is set up for a breakout to the upside and we have identified what we believe is the trigger point for an acceleration to the upside. All the bullish traders need now is for OPEC and its major ally Russia to stick to their guns and cut output.Technical AnalysisMonthly January West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil(Click to enlarge)One of the best ways to analyze a market is to take a top-down approach. This allows you to frame the market on the monthly and weekly chart then zero in on the daily chart for actual trade execution. It also allows you to determine the various trends that could be influencing the price action. For example, if the monthly, weekly and daily charts were all in an uptrend then the odds of a successful trade increase if you decide to trade the long side. Furthermore, it also helps let you know if you are trading with the trend or against. Trend traders tend to want to let trades run, while counter-trend traders tend to set objectives or exit…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-The-OPEC-Deal-The-Start-Of-A-New-Rally-In-Oil.html,"Dec 07, 2018 at 16:35 | Jim Hyerczyk","Dec 07, 2018",Is The OPEC Deal The Start Of A New Rally In Oil?
2018-12-07,"The U.S. Geological Survey has revised the technically recoverable reserves in the Wolfcamp Basin, in the Permian shale play, to 46.3 billion barrels of crude and 281 trillion cu ft of natural gas. That’s up from 20 billion barrels of crude and 16 trillion cu ft of gas in recoverable reserves in late 2016.It’s worth noting, however, the new estimate also includes the Bone Spring formation that makes up part of the Delaware Basin in the Permian. This is the first time this formation is included in the USGS oil and gas reserves assessment.Recoverable reserves are calculated based not just on exploration results and geology but also on the price level that makes the oil and gas commercially viable for extraction. The USGS carried out its revision earlier this year, so it must have reflected the improvement in oil prices, notably West Texas Intermediate that has now largely disappeared, sparking worry about the sustainability of production growth, which has been steady throughout the year.The national total hit 11.7 million bpd last month, an all-time high and also the highest in the world and the Permian was the major driver behind this growth. It is the shale play that produces the most oil and also boasts the fastest rate of production growth: in November the Permian yielded 3.63 million bpd of crude and the Energy Information Administration expects this to rise further to 3.695 million bpd this month.So, the Permian is already a star, but now it will shine more brightly. The USGS numbers mean it is the largest single reservoir of oil and gas in the United States and one of the largest on a global scale.  Related: U.S. Becomes Net Oil Exporter For First Time In 75 YearsThe Albuquerque Journal quoted the head of the state’s Oil and Gas Association as saying “Even for someone who understands the resources and potential of the Permian Basin, I can’t help but be surprised by the sheer enormity of what the USGS has reported. Ryan Flynn added “The Permian resources shared by New Mexico and Texas make this area one of the most important places in the world in terms of oil production.”While this is true, this rush to the Permian, aptly dubbed Permania, has led to some problems, namely price discounts as there are not enough pipelines to get the product to refiners and export markets. However, these problems are being addressed already and the Permania looks like it will only intensify unless prices slump below US$50 a barrel for WTI.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/USGS-Doubles-Permian-Oil-Reserves-Estimate.html,"Dec 07, 2018 at 13:36 | Irina Slav","Dec 07, 2018",Permian Oil Reserves May Be Twice As Big As We Thought
2018-12-07,"Baker Hughes reported a 1-rig decrease for oil and gas in the United States this week—a loss in rigs for the second week in a row, with a 10-rig decrease in the number of oil rigs.The total number of active oil and gas drilling rigs now stands at 1,075 according to the report, with the number of active oil rigs decreasing by 10 to reach 877 and the number of gas rigs increasing by 9 to reach 198.The oil and gas rig count is now 144 up from this time last year, 126 of which is in oil rigs.Crude oil prices skyrocketed on Friday after a rather abysmal November, as OPEC managed to pull it together in the final hour of production cut talks with its members and Russia. Despite the talks ending yesterday without a resolution as Russia’s Alexander Novak flew back home to discuss its options with President Vladimir Putin, Friday saw a resolution to the cuts as the group came together, with Russia, to shave 1.2 million bpd off its October production levels.The WTI benchmark was trading up 4.14% (+2.13) at $53.62 at 12:38pm EST—a roughly $2 per barrel increase week on week. Brent crude was trading up 4.46% (+2.68) at $62.74—about $3 up week on week. .Canada’s oil and gas rigs for the week decreased by 17 rigs this week after losing 5 rigs last week, bringing its total oil and gas rig count to 186, which is 33 fewer rigs than this time last year, with a 17-rig decrease for oil rigs, and a 4-rig increase for gas rigs.  The EIA’s estimates for US production for the week ending November 30 continues to weigh on prices, averaging 11.7 million bpd­ for the fourth week in a row and the highest production rate for the United States.By 1:07pm EDT, WTI had increased by 4.53% (+$2.33) at $53.82 on the day.

2018-12-07,"Libya’s crude oil production has fallen by about 300,000 bpd since the start of this month on the back of oil export terminal shutdowns amid harsh weather and full storage tanks, Kallanish Energy reports, citing a statement from the National Oil Corporation.Libya has been suffering severe rainfall that closed all its oil export terminals along with roads and the airport in Benghazi, Reuters reported earlier this week. Flooding and high waves on the coast made the docking of tankers impossible, stranding more oil in storage.Earlier in the week, a source close to NOC told S&P Global Platts the oil terminals shutdown and the limited storage capacity would reduce production by half that much. Storage capacity is critically full at the Zawiya terminal, which serves the Sharara oil field, according to the source, who added that production at Sharara is expected to be reduced by 50 percent as of Thursday morning local time. This is Libya’s largest producing field.The storage capacity problem surfaces as Libya tries to ramp up production closer to pre-war levels. As of November, the North African country pumped crude at a rate of a little over 1 million bpd. Libya hopes to score an exemption from the OPEC-wide oil production cuts that are currently being discussed with Russia in Vienna as it seeks to boost its oil revenues after years of civil war that has crippled its oil-dependent economy.OPEC’s intention to resume cutting came at the wrong time for Libya, which earlier this year suffered several production outages and in July output fell to just 660,000 bpd of crude thanks to field and pipeline blockades and clashes between LNA and opposing groups at the oil terminals. Just a month earlier, its production had fallen to half a million bpd. As of late November, Libya was producing 1.3 million bpd and plans were to boost this to 1.6 million bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Libyan-Oil-Production-Falls-300000-Bpd-In-December.html,"Dec 07, 2018 at 09:30 | Irina Slav","Dec 07, 2018","Libyan Oil Production Falls 300,000 Bpd In December"
