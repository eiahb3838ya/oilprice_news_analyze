despite falling oil prices, the 'glory days for us shale are far from over'
oil
prices
stabilized
on
wednesday
after
a
toxic
mix
of
market
forces
triggered
one
of
the
biggest
falls
for
years
however
despite
a
protracted
in
crude
futures
the
meteoric
rise
of
shale
should
continue
undeterred
over
the
coming
months
analysts
told
cnbc
in
short
as
much
as
the
recent
price
slump
has
injected
a
fresh
dose
of
uncertainty
it
is
unlikely
to
derail
the
shale
engine
stephen
brennock
oil
analyst
at
pvm
oil
associates
said
in
a
research
note
published
wednesday
the
fact
is
that
tight
oil
supply
is
expected
to
expand
by
at
least
million
bpd
in
in
doing
so
it
will
go
a
long
way
to
cementing
america
newfound
position
as
the
world
biggest
oil
producer
for
now
when
it
comes
to
the
shale
patch
the
glory
days
are
far
from
over
brennock
said
since
climbing
to
highs
in
early
october
crude
futures
have
tumbled
by
more
than
a
third
the
latest
wave
of
heavy
selling
comes
at
a
time
when
the
energy
market
as
well
as
the
global
economy
is
gripped
by
a
flurry
of
bearish
factors
heightened
concerns
of
oversupply
reports
of
swelling
inventories
forecasts
of
record
and
russian
output
and
intensifying
concerns
about
a
slowing
global
economy
have
all
placed
downward
pressure
on
the
value
of
a
barrel
of
oil
international
benchmark
brent

traded
at
around
on
wednesday
up
around
percent
while
