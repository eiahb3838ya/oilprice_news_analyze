opec
folks
are
not
doing
a
good
job
of
convincing
the
international
oil
community
that
they
are
going
to
be
a
strong
advocate
of
their
supply
cut
program
said
bob
yawger

those
output

a

pvm
oil
according
to
opec
own
forecasts
global
oil
stocks
will
build

in
the

compound
a
glut
in
oecd
commercial

an
effort
to
show
its
commitment
to
reducing

opec

secretary

mohammad
barkindo
said
in
a
letter
reviewed
by

to
reach
the
proposed
cut
of
million
bpd
the
effective
reduction
for
member
countries
was
percent
barkindo
said
that
is
higher
than
the
initially
discussed
cuts
of
percent
as
opec
seeks
to
accommodate
iran
libya
and
venezuela
which
are
exempt
from
any
requirement
to
cut
driving
the
has
been
sustained
oversupply
as
the
united
states
has
emerged
as
the
world
biggest
crude
producer
thanks
to
the
success
of
its
shale
industry
the
united

now
pumps
million
barrels

of

putting
it
ahead
of
