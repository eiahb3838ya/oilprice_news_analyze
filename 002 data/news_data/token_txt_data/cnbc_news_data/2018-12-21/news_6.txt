those
output
cuts
a
reduction
with
russia
and
other
producers
of
million

continues

pvm
oil
according
to
opec
own
forecasts
global
oil
stocks
will
build
by
bpd
in
the
first
half
of
this
will
compound
a
glut
in
oecd
commercial
oil
stocks
in
an
effort
to
show
its
commitment
to
reducing
supply
opec
will
release

quotas
for
its
members
and
allies
such
as
russia
opec
secretary
general
mohammad
barkindo
said
in
a
letter
reviewed
by

to
reach
the
proposed
cut
of
million
bpd
the
effective
reduction
for
member
countries
was
percent
barkindo
said
that
is
higher
than
the
initially
discussed
cuts
of
percent
as
opec
seeks
to
accommodate
iran
libya
and
venezuela
which
are
exempt
from
any
requirement
to
cut
