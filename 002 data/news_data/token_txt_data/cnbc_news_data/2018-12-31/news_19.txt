of

sell
offs
of

the
slump
came
after
washington
gave
unexpectedly
generous
sanction
waivers
to
iran
biggest
oil
buyers
and
as
concerns
over
a
global
economic
slowdown
amid
the
trade
dispute
dented
the
outlook
for
oil
demand
it
was
the
bailout
of
iran
that
really
pricked
the

trifecta
for
the

in
the
absence
of

new
the
first

point
for
oil
markets
would
come
around
may
or
a
month
or
so
earlier
when
the
of
iran
waivers
would
be
discussed
the
current
downward
pressure
on
oil
prices
should
likely
taper
off
from

opec

its
allies
including
russia
starts
curbing

by
million
barrels
per

bpd
the
market
however
might
still
remain
under
some
pressure
from
swelling
production
in
the
united
states
which
has
emerged
as
the
world
biggest
crude
producer
this
year
pumping
million
bpd
outside
the
united
states
production
in
russia
and
saudi
arabia
also
hit
record
levels
this
