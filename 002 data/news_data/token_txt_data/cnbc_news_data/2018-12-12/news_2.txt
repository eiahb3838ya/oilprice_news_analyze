the
divergence

looks
somewhat
firmer

it
did
previously
still
a
weaker

the
world
top

ahead
of
russia
and
saudi
arabia
we
are
quite
confident
that
will
be
successful
in
tightening
up
the
front
end
of
the

thus
keeping

said
investors
and
producers
however
fear
a
tsunami
of
additional
shale
oil
supply
in
late
and
as
new
pipelines
are
installed
from
the
permian
to
the
gulf
