oil
prices
rose
on
thursday
buoyed
by
a
drawdown
in
crude
inventories
and
signs
that
china
is
taking
more
concrete
steps
to
put
a
trade
war
truce
with
washington
into
action
crude
oil
prices
have
also
been
supported
by
supply
curbs
announced
last
week
although
gains
were
capped
after
the
producer
group
lowered
its
demand

crude

prices
rose
helped
by
the
easing
trade
tension
as
well
as
a
fall
in
inventories
anz
bank
said
on
thursday
the
news
that
china
is
looking
to
redraft
its
in
china
plan
boosted
hopes
that
trade
talks
are
progressing
better
than
expected
china
made
its
first
major
soybean
purchases
in
more
than
six
months
on
wednesday
while
beijing
also
appears
to
be
easing
its
industrial
push
dubbed
made
in
china
which
has
long
irked
washington
a
drop
in
crude
stockpiles
though
less
than
expected
has
helped
boost
sentiment
analysts
said
crude
inventories
fell
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
compared
with
market
expectations
for
a
decrease
of
million
barrels
meanwhile
the
organisation
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
said
demand
for
its
crude
would
fall
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
less
than
predicted
last
month
and
million
less
than
it
currently
produces
this
adds
to
the
concerns
of
several
market
watchers
that
the
decision
led
by
the
group
to
cut
production
by
million
bpd
overall
might
not
be
enough
to
override
a
glut
especially
on
the
back
of
soaring
output
the
is
pumping
oil
like
its
going
out
of
fashion
and
that
providing
issues
for
the
traditional
dynamic

crude

has
hit

bpd
is
set
to
end
as
the

top

producer
ahead
of
russia
and
saudi
arabia
at
this
point
the
cuts
appear
to
have
merely
put
a
floor
under
prices

wittner
said
in
a
note
we
still
believe
that
there
is
significant
upside
from
current
levels
however
it
is
not
clear
when
the
movement
will
take
place
if
the
market
needs
to
see
stockdraws
first
it
could
be
a
couple
of
months
