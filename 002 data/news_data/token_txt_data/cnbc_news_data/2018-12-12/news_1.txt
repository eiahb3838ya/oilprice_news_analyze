oil
prices
edged
up
on
thursday
buoyed
by
a
drawdown
in
inventories
and
by
signs
of
easing
trade
tensions
between
washington
and
beijing
oil
prices
have
also
been
supported
by
supply
curbs
announced
last
week
although
gains
have
been
muted
after
the
producer
group
lowered
its

helped
by
the

tension
as
well
as

on

the
news
that
china
is
looking
to
redraft
its
in
china
plan
boosted
hopes
that
trade
talks
are
progressing
better
than
expected
china
appears
to
be
easing
its
industrial
development
push
dubbed
in
china
which
has
long
irked
the
united
states
amid
talks
between
the
two
countries
to
reduce
trade
tensions
according
to
new
guidance
to
local
governments
a
drop
in
crude
stockpiles
though
less
than
expected
has
helped
boost
sentiment
analysts
said
crude
inventories
fell
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
compared
with
market
expectations
for
a
decrease
of
million
barrels
meanwhile
the
organisation
of

exporting
countries
opec
said
demand
for
its
crude
would
fall
to
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
less
than
predicted
last
month
and
million
less
than
it
currently
produces
this
adds
to
the
concerns
of
several
market
watchers
that
the
decision
led
by
the
group
to
cut
production
by
million
bpd
overall
might
not
be
enough
to
override
a
glut
especially
on
the
back
of
soaring
output
oil
markets
have
been
concerned
about
the
possibility
of
weaker
macroeconomic
and
oil
demand
growth
when
combined
with
booming
shale
output
this
could
keep
markets
oversupplied
in
even
with
the
cut

a
note
at
this
point
the
cuts
appear
to
have
merely
put
a
floor
under
