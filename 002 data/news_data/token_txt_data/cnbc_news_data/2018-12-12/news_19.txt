oil
rose
above
a
barrel
on
wednesday
supported
by
an
industry
report
that
showed
a
drop
in
crude
inventories
a
cut
in
libyan
exports
and
an
deal
to
trim
output
the
american
petroleum
institute
api
said
on
tuesday
that
crude
inventories
dropped
by
million
barrels
last
week
more
than
analysts
had
forecast
official
inventory
figures
are
due
later
on
wednesday

fallen
by
a

since
the

when
it

high

is
set
for
its
biggest
quarterly
slide
since
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
oil
market
is
regaining
further
ground
this
morning
in
the
wake
of
a
bullish
api
report
stephen
brennock
of
oil
broker
pvm
said
although
he
also
sounded
a
note
of
caution
after
all
the
fundamental
outlook
in
early
is
still
plagued
by
a
supply
surplus
and
is
therefore
not
conducive
for
a
sustained
price
rally
oil
has
been
supported
this
week
by
a
drop
in
supply
from
libya
which
declared
force
majeure
on
exports
from
its
largest
oilfield
on
sunday
after
tribesmen
and
state
security
guards
seized
the
facility
the
libyan
outage
follows
last
week
decision
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
some
producers
including
russia
to
cut
supply
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
for
six
months
from
the
deal
from
last
week
will
allow
more
of
a
bullish
position
to
be
taken
up
by
some
market
participants
from
this
point
analysts
at
jbc
energy
said
in
a
report
the
crude
picture
at
least
looks
somewhat
firmer
for
the
next
six
months
than
it
did
previously
while
these
supply
cuts
supported
prices
a
weaker
economic
outlook
and
higher
production
elsewhere
kept
gains
in
check
undermining
the
supply
cuts
is
soaring
output
in
the
united
states
which
is
set
to
end
as
the
world
top
oil
producer
ahead
of
russia
and
saudi
arabia
we
are
quite
confident
that
will
be
successful
in
tightening
up
the
front
end
of
the
oil
market
thus
keeping
the
brent
crude
oil
contract
in
a
barrel
territory
over
the
next
six
months
seb
commodities
strategist
bjarne
schieldrop
said
investors
and
producers
however
fear
a
tsunami
of
additional
shale
oil
supply
in
late
and
as
new
pipelines
are
installed
from
the
permian
to
the
gulf
