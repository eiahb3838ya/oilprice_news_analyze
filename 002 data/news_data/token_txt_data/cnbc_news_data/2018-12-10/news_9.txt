citi forecasts oil goes nowhere in 2019 as opec cuts and us pumps more
citi
believes
international
oil
prices
will
average
a
barrel
in
remaining
near
current
levels
as
production
cuts
encourage
drillers
to
put
more
crude
on
the
market
opec
russia
and
other
producers
agreed
on
friday
to
remove
million
barrels
per
day
from
the
market
beginning
in
january
the
move
follows
a
more
than
percent
collapse
in
oil
prices
that
saw
international
benchmark
brent
crude
fall
from
more
than
a
barrel
to
a
low
of
last
month
some
analysts
forecast
the
production
cuts
will
cause
brent
to
rebound
back
toward
or
a
barrel
however
citi
says
an
earlier
round
of
production
cuts
from
the
alliance
has
only
delayed
the
inevitable
rather
than
putting
oil
on
a
steady
upward
trajectory
the
new
supply
cuts
almost
certainly
set
up
another
