oil surges 10% after the settle, rebounding with stocks from christmas eve sell-off
oil
surged
on
wednesday
posting
its
strongest
daily
gain
in
more
than
two
years
in
a
partial
rebound
from
steep
losses
that
pushed
crude
benchmarks
to
lows
not
seen
since
both
and
brent
crude
rose
about
percent
their
largest
increase
since
when
opec
signed
a
landmark
agreement
to
cut
production
it
was
unclear
whether
buying
would
push
prices
higher
again
once
trading
desks
are
more
fully
staffed
after
the
new
year
begins
