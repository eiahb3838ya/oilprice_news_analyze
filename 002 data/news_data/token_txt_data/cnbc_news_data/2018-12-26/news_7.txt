on

perceptions
that
a

prompted
by
economic
worries
had
been
overdone
amid
an
effort
to
tighten
supply
crude
has
been
caught
up
in
wider
financial
market

as
the
government
shutdown

there
is
a
little
bit
of
to
the
downside
linked
to
global
market
fears
said
olivier
jakob
analyst
at
petromatrix
it
all
about
equities
opec
has
shown
it
wants
higher
prices
and
is
working
towards
that
goal

predicted
an

earlier
this

sechin
an
ally
of
russian
president
vladimir

the

mostly
linked
to
the

was
set
for
a
higher
opening
potentially
lending

some
support

wednesday
while

britain
germany
and
france
remained
closed

christmas
holidays
while
economic
worries
have
weighed
the
outlook
is
not
as
weak
as
in
when
a
supply
glut
built
up
because
the

exporting
countries
this
time
is
trying
to
prop
up
the
market
jakob
said
concerned
that
a
new
glut
could
take
shape
opec
and
its
allies
including
russia
decided
earlier

to
return
to
a

lower
output

and
some
ministers
have
even
suggested
taking
further
action
stephen
innes
head
of
trading
for
at
futures
brokerage
oanda
in
singapore
said
some
buying
interest
had
returned
but
he
added
economic
worries
will
continue
to
weigh
unless
opec
reassures
the
market
as
to
the
viability
of
the
supply
cuts
and
even
imposes
deeper
ones
as
some
members
have
suggested
