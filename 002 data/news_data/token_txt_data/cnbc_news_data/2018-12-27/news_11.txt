oil
prices
fell
more
than
percent
on
thursday
after
rebounding
percent
in
the
previous
session
as
worries
over
a
glut
in
crude
supply
and
concerns
over
a
faltering
global
economy
pressured
prices
even
as
a
stock
market
surge
offered

light

cents
lower
at
oil
prices
reached
highs
in
early
october
but
have
fallen
almost
percent
since
then
and
are
now
approaching
their
lowest
levels
for
months
brent
is
heading
for
losses
of
almost
percent
this
year
while
the
contract
has
dropped
almost
percent
three
months
ago
it
looked
as
if
the
global
oil
market
would
be
through
the
northern
hemisphere
winter
as
sanctions
removed
large
volumes
of
iranian
crude
but
other
oil
exporters
have
more
than
compensated
for
any
shortfall
filling
global
inventories
and
depressing
prices
the
fuel
glut
has
combined
with
faltering
investor
sentiment
in
other
asset
classes
producing
a
bear
market
for
oil
global
stocks
rebounded
on
wednesday
after
president
donald
trump
administration
attempted
to
shore
up
investor
confidence
and

spending
the

met
earlier

month

russia
and
agreed
to
reduce

by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
equivalent
to
more
than
percent
of
global
consumption
but
the
cuts
wo
take
effect
until
next
month
and
oil
production
has
been
at
or
near
record
highs
in
the
united
states
russia
and
saudi
arabia
with
the
pumping
million

both
saudi

have
put
a
cap
on
iran

tehran
has
said
its
private
exporters
have
no
problems
selling
its
oil
markets
need
more
concrete
evidence
on
improving
fundamental
metrics
and
to
bring
the
relationship
back
to
balance
before
oil
prices
can
reach
a
real
bottom
