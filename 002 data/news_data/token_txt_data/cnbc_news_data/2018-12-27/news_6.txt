participants

worried
about
an

three
months

it
looked
as
if
the
global

market
would
be
undersupplied
through

removed
large
volumes
of
iranian
crude

oil
exporters
have
compensated
for
any
shortfall

and
depressing

organization
of
the

countries
along

by

barrels
per

bpd
equivalent
to
more
than
percent
of
global
consumption

the
cuts
will
not
take
effect
until

production
has
been
at

near
record
highs
in

russia
and
saudi
