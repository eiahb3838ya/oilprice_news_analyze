lower oil prices are making some us fracking stocks look like bargains, says analyst
shares
of
certain
energy
producers
are
becoming
increasingly
attractive
investments
as
oil
prices
fall
along
with
the
broader
market
seaport
global
mike
kelly
told
cnbc
on
thursday
large
swaths
of
the
oil
sector
have
been
pummeled
as
concerns
about
a
supply
glut
and
global
economic
pressures
have
weighed
on
equities
kelly
who
leads
seaport
energy
exploration
and
production
research
team
suggested
that
the
declines
are
largely
tied
to
the
market
volatility
in
the
last
several
months
energy
is
so
tied
right
now
to
the
overall
health
of
the
economy
he
said
as
oil
prices
slid
thursday
after
rallying
percent
in
wednesday
trading
session
the
fear
right
now
is
that
demand
is
going
to
fall
off
a
cliff
wednesday
historic
surge
he
added
took
oil
up
with
it
simple
as
that
even
so
some
fracking
stocks
are
starting
to
look
like
bargains
in
the
wake
of
lower
oil
prices
kelly
said
on
power
lunch
one
i
always
come
back
to
is
diamondback
energy
whenever
the
stock
falls
under
a
share
he
said
shares
of
the
independent
oil
and
gas
producer
fell
as
low
as
in
thursday
trading
session
before
reversing
to
gain
percent
into
the
close
the
stock
is
down
nearly
percent
year
to
date
even
if
oil
fell
to
a
barrel
from
its
current
level
diamondback
would
be
the
last
e
p
standing
here
kelly
said
the
producer
ultimately
wins
in
this
sector
and
that
diamondback
at
the
same
time
kelly
said
oil
producers
such
as
diamondback
and
pdc
energy
another
one
of
his
stock
picks
were
responsible
for
oil
collapse
in
they
are
the
reason
we
at
oil
right
now
the
analyst
said
but
mainly
because
of
how
good
they
gotten
at
taking
oil
out
of
the
ground
for
investors
kelly
noted
that
oilfield
service
companies
particularly
halliburton
and
schlumberger
look
very
very
compelling
right
now
despite
some
concerning
data
points
such
as
tapering
growth
or
oversupply
they
do
look
like
very
very
compelling
values
the
analyst
said
halliburton
and
schlumberger
both
sank
in
thursday
trading
session
losing
and
percent
respectively
after
rebounding
from
their
intraday
lows
both
stocks
are
down
more
than
percent
