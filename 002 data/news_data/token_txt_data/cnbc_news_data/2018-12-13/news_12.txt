bpd
less

this
adds

the
concerns
of
several
market
watchers
that
the
decision
led
by
the

to
cut
production
might
not
be
enough
to
override
a
glut
and
push
prices
higher
a
combination
of
factors
such
as
production
cuts
by
opec
and
producers
such
as
russia
and
further
declines
in
iranian
exports
however
would
likely
keep
oil
markets
tight
in
the
first
half
of

jefferies

said
but
production
growth

almost
inevitably

this
means
that
by
early

market
could
move
back
into
oversupply
