oil
prices
climbed
more
than
percent
on
thursday
after
data
showed
inventory
declines
in
the
united
states
and
as
investors
began
to
expect
that
the
global
oil
market
could
have
a
deficit
sooner
than
they
had
previously
thought
opec
output
agreement
with
russia
and
canada
decision
to
mandate
production
cuts
could
create
an
oil
market
supply
deficit
by
the
second
quarter
of
next
year
if
top
producers
stick
to
the
deal
the
international

said
in
its
monthly

report
crude

other
than
some
additional
bullish
statement
out
of
the
saudis
or
russians
regarding
strict
adherence
to
last
week
agreement
or
a
supply
disruption
somewhere
around
the
globe
we
do
expect
any
headlines
capable
of
pushing

much
above
this

when

view

jim
ritterbusch
president

associates
said
in
a
note
global
oil
supply
has
outstripped
demand
over
the
last
six
months
inflating
inventories
and
pushing
crude
oil
price
at
the
end
of
november
to
its
lowest
in
more
than
a
year
but
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
big
producers
including
russia
said
last
week
they
agreed
to
cut
production
by
million
barrels

still
oil
demand
growth
is
slowing

opec
said
on
wednesday
that
demand
for
its
crude

would
fall
to
million
bpd
bpd
less
than
predicted
last
month
and
million
bpd
below
what
it
currently
produces
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
his
country
has
no
plans
to
reduce
its
oil
production
but
will
remain
a
member
of
opec
the
official
news
agency
irna
reported
factors
such
as
production
cuts
and
output
losses
elsewhere
should
keep
markets
tight
in
the
first
half
jefferies
analyst
jason
gammel
said
but
he
added
that
production
growth
will
almost
inevitably
in
as
incremental
pipeline
capacity
is
installed
in
the
permian
basin
this
means
that
by
early
the
market
could
move
back
into
oversupply
the
united
states
where
weekly
crude
production
has
hit
a
record
is
set
to
end
as
the
world
top
oil
producer
ahead
of
russia
and
saudi
arabia
global
supply
and
demand
should
reach
a
fine
balance
next
year
with
the
market
ebbing
and
flowing
on
either
side
of
equilibrium
compared
to
trending
for
prolonged
periods
of
over
and
undersupply
as
seen
since
the
turn
of
the
decade

whether
that
is
enough
to
bring
