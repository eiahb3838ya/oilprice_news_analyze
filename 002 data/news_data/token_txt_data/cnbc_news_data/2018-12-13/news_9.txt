the
global
oil
market
could
move
into
deficit
sooner
than
expected
thanks
to
opec
output
agreement
with
russia
and
to
canada
decision
to
cut
supply
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
thursday
the
iea
kept
its
forecast
for
global
oil
demand
growth
at
million
barrels
per
day
unchanged
from
its
projection
last
month
and
said
it
expected
growth
of
million
bpd
this
year
uncertainty
over
the
global
economy
stemming
from
trade
tensions
could
undermine
oil
consumption
next
year
as
growth
in
supply
gathers
pace
for
our
demand
growth
outlook
remains
at
million
bpd
even
though
oil
prices
have
fallen
back
considerably
since
the
early
october
peak
the
iea
said
some
of
the
support
provided
by
lower
prices
will
be
offset
by
weaker
economic
growth
globally
and
particularly
in
some
emerging
economies
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
agreed
last
week
with
russia
oman
and
other
producers
to
cut
oil
output
by
million
bpd
from
january
to
stem
a
in
unused
inventories
of
fuel
the
decision
by
the
government
of
canada
alberta
province
to
force
oil
producers
to
curtail
supply
will
bring
the
largest
reduction
to
crude
output
next
year
the
iea
said
alberta
crude
and
oil
sands
output
will
drop
by
bpd
from
january
to
force
down
vast
inventories
that
built
up
because
of
pipeline
capacity
constraints
the
oil
price
has
fallen
by
nearly
a
third
so
far
this
quarter
to
around
a
barrel
from
a
peak
close
to
in
early
october
in
its
previous
report
in
november
the
iea
said
it
expected
the
global
oil
market
to
remain
in
surplus
throughout
now
it
expects
a
deficit
to
materialize
by
the
second
quarter
of
next
year
provided
opec
sticks
to
its
supply
deal
time
will
tell
how
effective
the
new
production
agreement
will
be
in
rebalancing
the
oil
market
the
iea
said
part
of
the
weakness
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
stems
from
concern
about
how
much
an
economic
slowdown
could
eat
into
demand
growth
the
international
monetary
fund
and
the
organisation
for
economic
cooperation
and
development
expect
the
global
economy
to
expand
more
slowly
next
year
than
forecast
six
months
ago
the
oecd
in
november
projected
that
world
economic
growth
would
slow
to
percent
in
from
percent
this
year
uncertainty
about
trade
tensions
and
tighter
monetary
policies
continue
to
affect
confidence
and
investment
the
oecds
lower
expectation
for
the
world
economy
in
could
reduce
oil
demand
growth
by
roughly
bpd
