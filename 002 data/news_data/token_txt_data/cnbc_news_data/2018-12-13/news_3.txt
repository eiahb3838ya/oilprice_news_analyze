legendary trader andy hall bets oil prices are going to rebound
legendary
oil
trader
andy
hall
says
crude
prices
have
likely
hit
a
bottom
after
plunging
more
than
percent
over
the
last
two
months
i
think
with
prices
hovering
around
or
a
little
over
a
barrel
i
think
you
would
have
to
have
a
pretty
negative
outlook
on
the
global
economy
to
believe
that
prices
will
continue
their
downward
trajectory
he
said
in
an
interview
thursday
on
bloomberg
tv
so
i
think
on
balance
if
you
want
to
place
a
bet
on
oil
right
now
you
probably
better
off
betting
on
it
going
up
than
going
down
the
former
oil
trader
for
citi
is
famed
for
predicting
a
bull
market
for
crude
a
feat
that
earned
him
a
million
payout
at
the
investment
bank
some
of
the
shine
has
come
off
hall
reputation
since
the
man
once
deemed
an
oil
god
closed
his
hedge
fund
astenbeck
capital
management
following
hefty
losses
on
crude
bets
last
year
today
hall
still
trades
oil
with
his
own
money
and
serves
as
an
advisory
board
member
to
orbital
insight
a
company
that
uses
satellite
information
to
provide
data
on
crude
and
fuel
stockpiles
hall
says
he
not
expecting
a
global
recession
in
the
absence
of
a
worldwide
slowdown
a
correction
like
the
one
gripping
the
oil
market
today
tends
to
temper
supply
growth
and
stimulate
demand
for
fuel
for
hall
the
impact
of
opec
recently
announced
production
cuts
is
the
question
but
it
only
one
piece
of
the
puzzle
the
oil
market
is
also
grappling
with
headwinds
for
fuel
demand
concerns
about
a
looming
trade
war
and
dollar
strength
that
tends
to
weigh
on
crude
prices
according
to
hall
on
the
other
hand
not
only
have
you
had
opec
cut
production
there
no
question
that
lower
prices
will
have
an
impact
on
production
growth
here
in
the
hall
said
that
said
hall
believes
the
growth
in
shale
oil
output
has
been
the
biggest
surprise
this
year
right
now
growth
in
crude
production
here
in
the
is
about
million
barrels
a
day
back
in
january
the
government
eia
was
forecasting
growth
of
half
a
million
barrels
a
day
so
that
a
staggering
difference
he
said
watch
here
what
drives
the
price
of
oil
