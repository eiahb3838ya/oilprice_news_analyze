oil
prices
slipped
on
friday
after
china
reported
slower
economic
growth
pointing
to
lower
fuel
demand
in
the
world
biggest
oil
importer
although
market
sentiment
was
supported
by
supply
cuts
agreed
last
week
by
major
crude
producers
benchmark
brent
crude
was
down
cents
at
per
barrel
by

on
course
for
a
decline
this
week
of
around
percent
light
crude
was
cents
lower
at
china
the
world
economy
on
friday
reported
some
of
its
slowest
growth
in
retail
sales
and
industrial
output
in
years
highlighting
the
risks
of
the

chinese
oil
refinery
throughput
in
november
fell
from
october
suggesting
an
easing
in
oil
demand
though
runs
were
percent
above
levels
a
year
earlier
concerned
by
mounting
oversupply
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
other
oil
producers
including
russia
agreed
last
week
to
reduce
output
by
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
or
more
than
percent
of
global
demand
for
the
time
being
until
the
opec
cuts
start
kicking
in
the
market
is
oversupplied
in
the
short
term
said
tony
nunan
oil
risk
manager
at
mitsubishi
if
china
is
slowing
down
that
definitely
a
concern
the
international
energy
agency
said
on
thursday
that
it
expected
a
deficit
in
oil
supply
to
emerge
by
the
second
quarter
of
next
year
provided
opec
members
and
other
key
producers
stuck
closely
to
last
week
deal
to
cut
output
the
opec
cuts
will
have
a
substantial
impact
on
balances
compared
with
this
quarter
but
market
observers
may
need
to
wait
for
the
cuts
to
percolate

note
as
part
of
the
agreement
de
facto
opec
leader
saudi
arabia
plans
to
reduce
its
output
to
million
bpd
in
january
the
iea
kept
its
forecast
for
global
oil
demand
growth
at
million
bpd
unchanged
from
its
projection
last
month
and
said
it
expected
growth
of
million
bpd
this
year
our
market
balance
looks
million
bpd
tighter
next
year
on
reduced
opec
supply
such
that
the
surplus
is
just
million
bpd
