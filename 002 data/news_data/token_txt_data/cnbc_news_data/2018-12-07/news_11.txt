oil
prices
jumped
more
than
percent
on
friday
as
saudi
arabia
and
other
producers
in
opec
as
well
as
allies
like
russia
agreed
to
reduce
output
to
drain
global
fuel
inventories
and
support
the
market
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
and
its
allies
referred
to
as
agreed
to
slash
production
by
a
combined
million
barrels
per
day
from
this
was
larger
than
the
minimum
million
bpd
that
the
market
had
expected
despite
pressure
from
president
donald
trump
to
reduce
the
price
of
crude
opec
will
curb
output
by
bpd
from
january
while
allies
contribute
an
additional
bpd
of
cuts
iraqi
oil
minister
thamer
ghadhban
said
after
the
organization
concluded
two
days
of
talks
in
vienna
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
confirmed
the
combined
output
cuts
of
million
bpd
saying
the
market
would
be
oversupplied
through
the
first
half
of
the
year
brent
crude
rose
or
percent
to
a
barrel
by
edt
gmt
in
early
trading
the
global
benchmark
had
dropped
below
when
it
looked
as
if
oil
exporters
might
leave
output
targets
unchanged
it
then
rallied
to
a
session
high
of
on
news
of
the
agreement
crude
rose
to
a
barrel
after
earlier
reaching
a
session
high
of
crude
was
on
track
to
end
the
week
up
percent
and
brent
was
percent
higher
on
the
week
so
far
without
cuts
there
would
have
been
extreme
downward
pressure
on
the
market
said
john
paisie
executive
vice
president
at
stratas
advisors
a
consultancy
i
think
the
saudis
tried
to
walk
a
tightrope
they
want
to
make
sure
they
maintain
their
relationship
with
the
but
they
also
need
to
make
some
cuts
because
they
need
a
higher
oil
price
to
balance
their
budget
a
cut
if
implemented
fully
should
be
enough
to
largely
attenuate
but
not
eliminate
expected
implied
global
inventory
builds
in
the
first
half
of
next
year
harry
tchilinguirian
global
oil
strategist
at
bnp
paribas
in
london
told
the
reuters
global
oil
forum
oil
prices
have
plunged
percent
since
october
as
supply
has
surged
and
global
demand
growth
has
weakened
prices
fell
almost
percent
on
thursday
after
opec
ended
a
meeting
in
vienna
with
only
a
tentative
deal
to
tackle
weak
prices
talks
with
other
producers
were
held
on
friday
but
iran
gave
opec
the
green
light
friday
to
reduce
oil
output
after
finding
a
compromise
with
rival
saudi
arabia
over
a
possible
exemption
from
the
cuts
an
opec
source
said
output
from
the
world
biggest
producers
opec
russia
and
the
united
states
has
increased
by
million
bpd
since
the
end
of
to
million
bpd
meeting
almost
percent
of
global
consumption
the
surge
is
mainly
due
to
soaring
oil
production
which
has
jumped
by
million
bpd
since
early
to
a
record
million
bpd
making
the
united
states
the
world
biggest
producer
drillers
this
week
cut
oil
rigs
by
the
most
in
over
two
years
after
adding
rigs
in
recent
weeks
energy
companies
cut
oil
rigs
in
the
week
to
the
biggest
weekly
decline
since
may
bringing
the
total
count
down
to
general
electric
co
baker
hughes
energy
services
firm
said
in
its
closely
followed
report
on
friday
rig
count
is
an
indicator
of
future
production
still
the
number
of
rigs
remains
up
from
a
year
ago
given
supply
due
to
come
online
some
analysts
and
market
participants
said
the
cut
may
not
be
sufficient
to
end
oil
rout
relative
to
how
big
this
looming
supply
tsunami
is
it
is
not
nearly
enough
to
prevent
big
inventory
builds
next
year
said
robert
mcnally
president
of
rapidan
energy
group
in
washington
president
trump
and
president
putin
prevented
from
cutting
by
more
which
was
certainly
needed
to
put
a
sturdy
floor
under
prices
they
are
putting
a
fuzzy
floor
under
prices
trump
has
asked
opec
to
keep
prices
low
pleading
with
the
saudis
in
twitter
messages
russia
had
initially
balked
at
cutting
production
alongside
opec
