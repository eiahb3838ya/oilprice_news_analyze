innes
said
the

exporting
countries
and
its

have
agreed
to
curb

however
some
analysts
said
that
oil
markets
were
expected
to
remain
oversupplied
in
the
as
the
planned
supply
cuts
would
likely
help
in
some
rebalancing
only
by
the
of
next
year
growing
concerns
about
weakening
growth
in
major
economies
such
as
china
and
europe
also
dampened
the
mood
in
markets
for
oil
and
other
asset
classes
chinese
oil
refinery
throughput
in
november
fell
from
october
suggesting
an
easing
in
oil
demand
while
the
country
industrial
output
rose
the
least
in
nearly
three
years
as
the
economy
continued
to
lose
momentum
meanwhile
french
business
activity
plunged
unexpectedly
into
contraction
this
month
retreating
at
the
fastest
pace
in
over
four
years
while
germany
private
sector
expansion
slowed
to
a
low
in

the
potential
for
a
significant
movement
in
the

clearly
has
an
impact
on
