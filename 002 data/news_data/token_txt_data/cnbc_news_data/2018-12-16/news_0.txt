oil
prices
were
largely
steady
on
monday
after
falling
percent
in
the
previous
session
but
remained
under
pressure
amid
weaker
growth
in
major
economies
and
concerns
about
oversupply
international
brent
crude
oil
futures
were
at
per

at
gmt
up
cents
or
percent
from
their
last
close
west
texas
intermediate
wti
crude
futures
were
at
per
barrel
up
cents
or
percent
persistent
growth
in
shale
output
continues
to
weigh
on
oil
prices
while
some
analysts
doubted
that
planned
supply
cuts
led
by
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
would
be
enough
to
rebalance
markets
i
do
believe
opec
cuts
will
work
this
time
around
with
qatar
going
out
and
iran
refusing
to
cut
while
there
a
big
question
mark
when
russia
will
go
to
its
agreed
level
said
sukrit
vijayakar
director
of
oil
consultancy
trifecta
meanwhile
production
will
go
on
increasing
so
the
whole
load
will
effectively
be
on
saudi
arabia
who
is
under
severe
pressure
from
trump
anyway
opec
and
its
allies
have
agreed
to
curb
output
from
january
in
a
move
to
be
reviewed
at
a
meeting
in
april
saudi
arabia
is
opec
de
facto
leader
meanwhile
increasing
concerns
about
weakening
growth
in
major
markets
such
as
china
and
europe
also
dampened
the
mood
in
oil
and
other
asset
classes
chinese
oil
refinery
throughput
in
november
fell
from
october
suggesting
an
easing
in
oil
demand
while
the
country
industrial
output
rose
the
least
in
nearly
three
years
as
the
economy
continued
to
lose
momentum
french
business
activity
plunged
unexpectedly
into
contraction
this
month
retreating
at
the
fastest
pace
in
over
four
years
while
germany
private
sector
expansion
slowed
to
a
low
in
december
but
oil
prices
were
supported
after
general
electric
co
baker
hughes
energy
services
firm
said
on
friday
that
drillers
cut
four
oil
rigs
in
the
week
to
pulling
the
total
count
to
the
lowest
since
at
however
the
current
rig
count
which
serves
as
an
early
indicator
of
future
output
is
higher
than
a
year
ago
when
rigs
were
active
the
potential
for
a
significant
movement
in
the
dollar
clearly
has
an
impact
on
oil
pricing

the
fed

week
