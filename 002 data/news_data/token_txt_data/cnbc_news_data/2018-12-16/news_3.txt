qatari foreign minister criticizes iran sanctions, uae foreign policy as 'destabilizing'
qatar
foreign
minister
expressed
a
host
of
grievances
over
his
gulf
counterparts
regional
activities
on
sunday
calling
out
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
uae
in
particular
and
not
just
for
their
blockade
of
his
country
we
can
not
blame
one
country
on
the
destabilization
of
the
region
right
now
because
the
situation
which
we
are
suffering
from
is
the
result
of
a
series
of
policies
of
different
countries
sheikh
mohammed
bin
abdulrahman
al
thani
told
cnbc
hadley
gamble
in
doha
when
asked
if
riyadh
were
to
blame
for
increased
turbulence
in
the
middle
east
we
are
disagreeing
with
saudi
arabia
currently
when
they
are
blockading
qatar
when
they
continue
the
war
on
yemen
without
reason
the
way
they
kidnapped
the
lebanese
prime
minister
the
foreign
minister
said
but
he
did
not
limit
his
criticism
to
saudi
arabia
which
in
spearheaded
an
economic
and
diplomatic
blockade
against
qatar
over
accusations
doha
supports
terrorism
something
the
qataris
deny
we
disagree
also
with
the
emiratis
policy
when
they
go
and
supported
brutal
regimes
supported
military
coup
in
libya
supported
a
destabilization
in
somalia
supported
the
separation
and
division
of
yemen
and
it
just
these
policies
which
are
destabilization
