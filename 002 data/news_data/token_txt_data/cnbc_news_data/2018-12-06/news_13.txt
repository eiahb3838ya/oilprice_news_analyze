opec
tentatively
agreed
an
cut
on
thursday
but
was
waiting
to
hear
from
heavyweight
russia
before
deciding
the
exact
volumes
for
a
production
reduction
aimed
at
propping
up
crude
prices
two
sources
from
the
group
said
russian
energy
minister
alexander
novak
flew
home
from
vienna
earlier
for
talks
with
president
vladimir
putin
in
st
petersburg
novak
returns
to
the
austrian
capital
on
friday
for
discussions
among
opec
and
the
group
allies
the
price
of
crude
has
fallen
almost
a
third
since
october
but
president
donald
trump
has
demanded
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
make
oil
even
cheaper
by
refraining
from
output
cuts
we
hope
to
conclude
something
by
the
end
of
the
day
tomorrow
we
have
to
get
the
countries
on
board
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
told
reporters
before
the
opec
meeting
started
if
everybody
is
not
willing
to
join
and
contribute
equally
we
will
wait
until
they
are
asked
whether
opec
could
fail
to
reach
a
deal
falih
said
all
options
were
on
the
table
possible
output
cuts
by
opec
and
its
allies
ranged
from
million
bpd
and
million
bpd
was
acceptable
he
said
opec
meeting
began
around
gmt
and
was
still
ongoing
after
hours
brent
oil
futures
fell
as
much
as
percent
to
below
per
barrel
on
fears
that
there
could
be
no
deal
but
later
recovered
somewhat
trading
down
percent
by
gmt
one
million
bpd
may
disappoint
many
but
should
the
cut
be
from
a
september
or
october
baseline
rather
than
november
the
net
impact
would
be
sufficient
to
limit
storage
builds
greg
sharenow
executive
for
pimco
said
on
the
sidelines
of
the
opec
meeting
it
is
unlikely
to
spark
a
meaningful
price
rally
but
also
will
not
be
so
dire
either
in
many
respects
it
is
the
middle
road
which
may
be
the
optimal
solution
said
sharenow
who
helps
manage
a
billion
commodities
fund
at
the
trillion
investment
management
firm
opec
delegates
have
said
the
group
and
its
allies
could
cut
by
million
bpd
if
russia
contributed
bpd
of
that
reduction
if
russia
contributed
around
bpd
the
overall
cut
could
exceed
million
bpd
novak
said
on
thursday
that
russia
would
find
it
harder
to
cut
oil
output
in
winter
than
other
producers
because
of
the
cold
weather
oil
prices
have
crashed
as
saudi
arabia
russia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
raised
output
since
june
after
trump
called
for
higher
production
to
offset
lower
exports
from
iran
opec
producer
russia
saudi
arabia
and
the
united
states
have
been
vying
for
the
position
of
top
crude
producer
in
recent
years
the
united
states
is
not
part
of
any
initiative
due
to
its
legislation
and
fragmented
oil
industry
trump
raises
pressure
iranian
exports
have
plummeted
after
the
united
states
imposed
fresh
sanctions
on
tehran
in
november
but
washington
gave
sanctions
waivers
to
some
buyers
of
iranian
crude
further
raising
fears
of
an
oil
glut
next
year
hopefully
opec
will
be
keeping
oil
flows
as
is
not
restricted
the
world
does
not
want
to
see
or
need
higher
oil
prices
trump
wrote
in
a
tweet
on
wednesday
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
said
on
thursday
he
would
support
a
cut
as
long
as
iran
did
not
need
to
reduce
its
own
output
iraqi
oil
minister
thamer
ghadhban
said
iraq
as
opec
producer
would
support
and
join
a
cut
possibly
complicating
any
opec
decision
is
the
crisis
around
the
killing
of
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
at
the
saudi
consulate
in
istanbul
in
october
trump
has
backed
saudi
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
despite
calls
from
many
politicians
to
impose
stiff
sanctions
