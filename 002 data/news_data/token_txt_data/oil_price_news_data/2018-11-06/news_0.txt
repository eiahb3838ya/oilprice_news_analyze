the truth about iran oil sanction waivers
the
trump
administration
has
dropped
the
hammer
officially
putting
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
why
then
might
iran
s
oil
exports
actually
increase
in
the
near
future
the
granted
waivers
to
eight
countries
allowing
them
to
continue
to
import
oil
from
iran
for
a
period
washington
spun
the
waivers
as
a
brief
period
of
time
that
would
allow
a
handful
of
countries
to
get
their
imports
from
iran
down
to
zero
some
countries
really
depend
on
iran
so
a
grace
period
would
give
them
a
bit
more
government
was
a
bit
defensive
about
the
action
no
one
s
going
to
argue
that
secretary
pompeo
isn
t
tough
on
iran
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
said
on
fox
news
and
no
one
is
going
to
argue
that
president
trump
isn
t
doing
the
he
cited
the
loss
of
around
million
barrels
per
day
of
iranian
oil
exports
as
evidence
that
the
policy
was
working
that
number
will
fall
yet
the
president
himself
revealed
the
logic
behind
the
waivers
we
have
the
toughest
sanctions
ever
imposed
but
on
oil
we
want
to
go
a
little
bit
slower
because
i
do
want
to
drive
the
oil
prices
in
the
world
president
trump
told
reporters
on
monday
i
could
get
the
iran
oil
down
to
zero
immediately
but
it
would
cause
a
shock
to
the
it
s
highly
debatable
that
the
could
have
succeeded
in
slashing
iran
s
oil
exports
to
zero
but
even
if
it
did
succeed
there
is
little
doubt
that
oil
prices
would
be
substantially
higher
than
they
are
eight
countries
granted
waivers
included
south
korea
taiwan
turkey
greece
japan
china
india
and
italy
many
of
these
countries
had
already
made
sharp
reductions
in
their
purchases
of
iranian
oil
which
allowed
them
to
curry
favor
with
washington
as
they
sought
some
leniency
on
sanctions
related
the
rapid
acceleration
towards
peak
oil
demandnotably
however
south
korea
and
japan
had
already
zeroed
out
their
imports
from
iran
well
ahead
of
the
deadline
the
waivers
for
them
then
are
a
bit
curious
the
trump
administration
may
have
wanted
to
reward
allies
that
had
been
cooperative
however
it
could
also
allow
them
to
resume
purchases
of
iranian
s
trade
minister
hiroshige
seko
said
on
tuesday
that
japanese
refiners
could
begin
buying
oil
from
iran
again
now
that
they
have
a
exemption
south
korea
could
also
import
around
bpd
from
iran
again
which
is
notable
since
south
korea
hasn
t
purchased
oil
from
iran
since
june
according
to
the
chinese
refiners
who
also
cut
their
purchases
are
interested
in
buying
oil
once
again
according
to
reuters
china
will
be
allowed
to
buy
around
bpd
which
is
about
half
of
what
the
country
imported
over
the
past
two
years
an
unnamed
trader
told
reuters
that
enquiries
for
cargoes
from
iran
are
coming
in
from
several
asian
combined
the
exemptions
will
allow
iran
to
continue
to
export
oil
and
it
might
even
be
able
to
increase
exports
from
current
levels
iran
exported
somewhere
around
million
barrels
per
day
in
october
and
according
to
s
p
global
platts
might
export
around
in
november
but
the
losses
could
potentially
stop
there
and
might
even
rise
if
some
countries
resume
is
likely
that
iranian
oil
exports
will
stabilise
at
their
present
level
of
a
good
million
barrels
per
day
commerzbank
said
in
a
note
exports
could
even
increase
again
in
the
coming
months
because
japan
and
south
korea
have
hardly
been
buying
any
iranian
oil
of
late
amid
uncertainty
ahead
of
the
sanctions
and
as
a
gesture
of
goodwill
towards
the
the
investment
bank
said
the
waivers
and
the
potential
increase
in
shipments
to
asia
is
bad
news
for
oil
prices
related
bolton
is
preparing
more
sanctions
against
iranthere
is
quite
a
bit
of
disagreement
over
the
trajectory
of
iran
s
exports
citi
s
ed
morse
told
bloomberg
tv
that
oil
prices
are
actually
biased
to
the
upside
for
the
rest
of
the
year
morse
said
that
oil
prices
could
average
per
barrel
in
the
fourth
quarter
and
might
even
spike
to
or
he
noted
that
whether
or
not
such
scenarios
play
out
largely
depend
on
iran
as
well
as
some
other
potential
while
the
market
is
suddenly
bearish
on
oil
because
of
iran
waivers
morse
notes
that
the
waivers
are
only
temporary
and
that
the
trump
administration
won
t
allow
countries
receiving
waivers
to
import
unlimited
quantities
how
much
oil
is
being
granted
from
iran
to
each
of
those
eight
countries
we
can
only
surmise
until
we
get
a
tweet
from
somebody
in
the
government
morse
told
bloomberg
analysts
agreed
with
that
sentiment
we
do
not
see
the
eight
countries
having
carte
blanche
to
import
what
they
like
the
consultancy
fge
said
in
a
bottom
line
is
that
there
is
not
a
lot
of
clarity
regarding
what
to
expect
on
iran
s
exports
the
waivers
could
allow
exports
to
stabilize
and
perhaps
even
edge
up
temporarily
however
the
trump
administration
is
keen
on
tightening
the
screws
the
waivers
expire
in
may
and
surely
the
wants
iran
s
exports
to
be
lower
by
washington
will
only
be
able
to
move
as
fast
as
the
oil
market
allows
which
after
months
of
bluster
is
something
that
the
administration
finally
we
will
ensure
that
as
more
barrels
of
iranian
crude
and
condensate
come
off
the
market
that
we
accomplish
our
national
security
objectives
without
increasing
the
price
of
oil
brian
hook
head
of
the
state
department
iran
action
group
told
reporters
on
a
conference
call
we
have
a
high
degree
of
confidence
that
we
will
be
able
to
do
that
s
the
goal
but
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
the
oil
market
is
loose
enough
to
allow
for
that
harder
line
