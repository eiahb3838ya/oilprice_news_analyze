the clock is ticking for chinaâ€™s oil independence
china
is
pulling
out
all
stops
in
order
to
increase
its
oil
and
gas
production
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
will
likely
not
be
enough
to
stop
the
world
s
second
largest
economy
from
becoming
over
reliant
on
geopolitically
charged
crude
oil
and
natural
gas
monday
chinese
oil
majors
cnpc
and
sinopec
also
asia
s
largest
refinery
said
they
were
speeding
up
drilling
and
exploration
from
major
tight
oil
and
shale
gas
formations
in
the
country
s
western
regions
cnpc
also
said
that
new
exploration
in
shale
gas
tight
oil
and
tight
gas
will
lead
to
growth
in
production
for
the
country
s
largest

company
added
that
the
drilling
cycle
at
the
mahu
field
in
xinjiang
one
of
cnpc
s
largest
findings
in
recent
years
fell
around
percent

this

ambitions
to
develop
more
of
its

is
a
race
against
a
ticking

the
middle

has
already
bypassed
the

become
the
world
s
top
oil
importer
with
much
of
those
oil
imports
having
geopolitical
strings
attached
china
is
the
largest
importer
of
iranian
oil
and
that
resource
is
being
jeopardized
by
fresh
sanctions
against
iran
s

sector
that
went
onto

on

china
is
also
reliant
on
both
russia
and
saudi

from

that
it
