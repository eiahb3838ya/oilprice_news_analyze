does u.s. oil really need more oil export terminals?
when
crude
oil
exports
earlier
this
year
hit
a
record
high
of
million
bpd
there
was
much
joy
and
but
amid
this
joy
a
few
problems
have
reared
their
ugly
heads
notably
pipeline
capacity
shortages
and
perhaps
worse
export
terminal
capacity
is
only
one
port
on
the
gulf
coast
that
has
the
capability
to
load
very
large
crude
carriers
that
can
ship
as
much
as
million
bpd
of
crude
this
is
the
offshore
oil
port
of
louisiana
and
as
the
wall
street
journal
s
rebecca
elliot
noted
in
a
recent
story
on
the
shortage
topic
it
is
mostly
used
for
production
in
the
permian
booming
producers
traders
and
investors
are
growing
increasingly
eager
to
make
more
export
terminals
reuters
reported
this
week
the
carlyle
group
had
teamed
up
with
the
port
authority
of
corpus
christi
in
texas
to
build
what
the
company
says
will
be
the
first
onshore
export
terminal
capable
of
loading
and
a
couple
of
pipeline
builders
and
operators
are
also
planning
terminals
in
texas
and
louisiana
to
take
the
influx
of
new
supply
from
the
shale
patch
but
whether
they
will
actually
be
built
remains
uncertain
there
is
a
complex
regulatory
approval
process
that
can
delay
the
projects
potentially
compromising
their
profitability
as
elliot
notes
there
are
analysts
who
doubt
the
demand
prospects
of
all
these
export
terminals
and
with
each
of
them
costing
upwards
of
a
billion
dollars
the
rush
to
build
them
as
soon
as
possible
is
understandable
related
world
s
cheapest
natural
gas
market
could
be
facing
a
shortagethere
is
one
more
reason
to
rush
the
permian
producers
are
selling
their
oil
at
a
considerable
discount
to
the
west
texas
intermediate
benchmark
because
there
are
not
enough
pipelines
to
carry
it
more
cheaply
to
refiners
yet
several
are
coming
online
in
the
next
couple
of
years
and
will
add
around
million
bpd
to
existing
capacity
which
stands
at
million
barrels
daily
these
pipelines
will
need
terminals
to
connect
the
other
hand
the
rush
might
be
premature

coleman
as
saying
everyone
is
racing
to
throw
their
hat
in
the
ring
and
get
their
project
done
before
everyone
else
there
s
simply
not
enough
oil
volumes
to
go
indeed
while
upbeat
estimates
of
future
exports
see
them
rising
to
as
much
as
to
million
bpd
the
capacity
of
all
the
export
terminals
being
planned
right
now
is
more
than
this
in
other
words
there
will
not
be
a
need
for
all
of
them
so
those
that
manage
to
build
theirs
first
will
be
the
winners
securing
this
won
t
solve
another
problem
congestion
the
louisiana
offshore
oil
port
is
already
pretty
busy
and
higher
exports
won
t
help
matters
the
same
is
true
for
the
port
of
corpus
christi
a
new
oil
export
terminal
will
add
a
lot
of
traffic
which
could
well
result
in
congestion
basically
as
they
solve
their
pipeline
bottleneck
problem
the
oil
producers
in
texas
will
be
facing
another
one
on
the
s
a
puzzle
that
will
be
difficult
to
solve
oil
has
to
go
somewhere
because
there
is
no
chance
producers
will
simply
start
pumping
less
local
refineries
can
only
take
in
so
much
of
it
the
rest
will
have
to
be
exported
and
to
make
the
situation
more
difficult
it
has
to
be
exported
at
competitive
prices
these
would
be
hard
to
achieve
with
the
high
costs
of
transportation
and
loading
to
date
one
or
a
couple
of
new
terminals
could
go
a
long
way
towards
solving
