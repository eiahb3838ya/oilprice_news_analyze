the clock is ticking: how much oil will iran lose?
those
energy
analysts
who
are
not
yet
bored
to
death
with
the
whole
iran
business
must
be
having
a
field
day
making
forecast
after
forecast
about
how
many
barrels
the
country
will
lose
following
next
monday
s
of
sanctions
there
is
a
lot
of
space
for
speculation
and
guesswork
and
even
those
who
are
wary
of
making
shocking
forecasts
don
t
have
a
lot
of
facts
to
work
with
yet
it
s
been
six
months
since
president
trump
announced
the
sanctions
and
since
then
a
lot
of
data
has
is
still
coming
that
the
initial
shocking
forecasts
of
losses
of
between
and
million
bpd
in
iranian
exports
were
slightly
compiled
by
clipperdata
and
reported
by
the
energy
information
administration
for
one
thing
suggests
that
iran
exported
a
little
less
than
million
bpd
in
september
that
s
the
same
month
when
there
was
a
flurry
of
media
reports
about
sharp
drops
in
iranian
exports
based
on
conventional
tanker
tracking
suggesting
that
iran
had
lost
as
much
as
million
bpd
in
outbound
shipments
as
the
clipperdata
regular
updates
based
on
satellite
imaging
from
this
is
not
the
actual
japanese
and
south
korean
refiners
said
publicly
that
they
have
stopped
all
iranian
oil
purchases
ahead
of
the
hopes
of
securing
a
waiver
from
the
department
of
and
india
continued
guzzling
iranian
crude
in
substantial
amounts
china
bought
about
bpd
of
iranian
crude
in
september
clipperdata
estimated
with
india
importing
bpd
that
s
down
from
the
average
for
the
first
half
of
the
year
but
not
dramatically
the
average
for
china
was
bpd
and
for
india
it
was
yesterday
reported
almost
all
iranian
oil
tankers
in
the
persian
gulf
have
now
switched
off
their
geolocation
devices
and
were
moving
around
back
and
forth
between
ports
to
create
this
basically
means
the
market
would
have
to
wait
for
at
least
a
couple
of
weeks
after
november
to
get
any
relatively
reliable
data
about
how
iranian
exports
are
faring
amid
the
sanctions
even
so
some
analysts
are
once
again
predicting
losses
of
million
meanwhile
is
preparing
earlier
this
week
media
reported
that
president
rouhani
had
replaced
the
economic
team
of
the
government
and
that
four
cargoes
of
crude
were
sold
on
the
iranian
energy
exchange
the
amount
is
not
a
great
one
at
less
than
bpd
but
it
could
be
the
start
of
something
regular
related
opec
radical
strategy
change
after
the
midtermsthe
idea
for
the
exchange
is
to
have
private
local
entities
buy
the
crude
and
then
resell
it
to
foreign
traders
analysts
accurately
point
out
that
this
would
still
put
the
foreign
entities
on
the
hook
for
penalties
from
washington
as
doing
business
with
iranian
entities
would
constitute
a
breach
of
the
sanctions
yet
smugglers
would
hardly
care
about
iranian
sanctions
so
there
is
a
good
chance
that
illegal
entities
would
make
use
of
this
the
same
time
washington
is
looking
into
waivers
according
to
a
state
department
spokeswoman
who
spoke
to
s
p
global
platts
this
week
our
goal
remains
to
get
to
zero
oil
imports
from
iran
as
quickly
as
possible
we
are
prepared
to
work
with
countries
that
are
reducing
their
imports
on
a
basis
although
the
two
parts
of
this
statement
are
kind
of
mutually
exclusive
chances
are
even
the
most
hawkish
hawks
in
the
trump
administration
have
realized
that
they
do
not
have
complete
control
over
who
buys
iranian
crude
and
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
black
market
that
iran
must
be
familiar
with
given
its
past
sanction
