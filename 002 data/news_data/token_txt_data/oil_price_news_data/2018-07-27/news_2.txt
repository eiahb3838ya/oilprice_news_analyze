whatâ€™s keeping investors away from energy stocks?
the
prices
of
crude
oil
and
natural
gas
liquids
are
much
higher
than
they
were
a
year
ago
and
the
outlook
for
natural
gas
prices
has
improved
however
dozens
of
profitable
upstream
oil
gas
companies
are
still
trading
in
the
lower
half
of
their
range
the
money
managers
on
wall
street
either
don
t
understand
how
profitable
upstream
companies
are
at
these
commodity
prices
or
they
believe
oil
prices
have
peaked
and
are
going
to
let
me
say
that
most
investors
let
s
call
them
the
wall
street
gang
really
don
t
understand
the
upstream
oil
gas
these
are
the
companies
that
drill
complete
and
operate
oil
gas
wells
which
provide
the
primary
energy
sources
that
give
us
such
a
high
standard
of
living
in
the
united
states
most
investors
don
t
realize
how
profitable
the
business
will
be
if
crude
oil
prices
just
stay
over
not
to
mention
the
wealth
that
will
be
created
if
oil
bounces
back
to
over
july
i
made
a
presentation
in
houston
to
a
room
full
of
energy
sector
investors
were
i
gave
my
thoughts
on
a
recent
raymond
james
associates
industry
update
and
their
oil
price
target
raymond
james
energy
team
based
in
houston
is
now
forecasting
that
west
texas
intermediate
wti
will
average
during
the
half
of
and
the
beginning
of
their
official
price
forecast
for
oil
prices
are
for
wti
and
for
brent
after
unofficially
most
of
the
analysts
based
in
houston
that
i
talk
to
think
oil
prices
are
going
a
lot
opinions
are
that
the
price
of
oil
never
stays
at
the
right
price
for
long
oil
price
cycles
always
on
the
downside
and
the
upside
so
there
is
a
good
chance
we
see
wti
prices
spike
over
within
the
next
twelve
months
if
you
agree
with
me
then
you
should
have
a
lot
of
high
quality
oil
gas
company
stocks
in
your
prices
should
be
set
by
fundamentals
so
let
s
check
that
out
first
then
i
will
go
over
some
of
the
fears
that
seem
to
be
keeping
the
wall
street
money
managers
on
the
sidelines
related
oil
jobs
under
threat
from

for
oil
is
increasing
about
million
barrels
per
day
each
year
and
production
is
declining
by
approximately
million
barrels
per
day
this
paints
a
bullish
outlook
for
the
energy
sector
companies
that
work
in
the
upstream
midstream

looking
only
at
the
fundamentals
should
be
a
very
good
year
for
the
energy
sector
what
are
investors
afraid
of
why
hasn
t
more
money
rotated
into
the
energy
sector
fear
and
greed
drive
the
marketsthere
are
four
primary
fears
that
are
keeping
money
managers
on
the
sidelines
on
top
of
these
are
company
specific
fears
that
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
s
cover
each
of
these
primary
fears
one
at
a
supply
growth
will
overwhelm
the
oil
marketit
is
true
that
oil
production
is
growing
in
the
united
states
but
the
rate
of
growth
will
slow
after
without
a
significant
increase
in
the
active
drilling
rig
count
there
is
no
way
the
still
a
net
importer
of
more
than
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
can
meet
global
demand
for
oil
on
its
own
outside
of
the
all
of
the
other
countries
net
to
declining
oil
supply
and
this
assumes
only
modest
declines
in
venezuela
and
iran
in
opec
only
saudi
arabia
has
significant
untapped
production
capacity
and
it
does
not
appear
that
they
can
offset
the
declines
in
venezuela
libya
angola
and
iran
following
the
implementation
of
sanctions
in
can
not
keep
growing
oil
production
at
the
current
pace
or
even
close
to
it
unless
there
is
a
significant
rise
in
the
active
rig
count
during
a
july
presentation
in
houston
raymond
james
estimated
that
the
active
onshore
drilling
rig
count
in
the
would
need
to
increase
by
more
than
next
year
in
order
for
the
to
duplicate
the
production
growth
in
i
don
t
think
it
is
possible
because
the
onshore
drilling
companies
don
t
have
a
lot
more
high
end
drilling
rigs
sitting
around
and
they
won
t
build
them
without
active
rig
count
must
grow
each
year
because
the
nation
s
annual
depletion
rate
is
increasing
as
we
layer
on
more
and
more
high
decline
rate
horizontal

the
high

rigs
don
t
exist

believe
that
will
be
the

of

production
growth
in
the

are
expected
to

and
in
reasons
for

are

the

it

the

saudi
arabia
the
kingdom
s
claim
that
they
have
remaining
production
capacity
of
million
barrels
per
day
is
a
myth
it
would
take
an
aggressive
drilling
program
and
lots
of
new
infrastructure
to
push
their
production
up
to
million
barrels
per
day
raymond
james
rj
base
model
for
to
global
oil
supply
demand
is
that
saudi
arabia
s
actual
production
will
average
million
barrels
per
day
thru
saudi
s
recent
increases
in
exports
are
the
result
of
draining
storage
tanks
and
can
not
be
sustained
for
is
a
failed
state
rj
s
base
assumption
is
that
venezuela
s
production
goes
from
mmbopd
in
to
mmbopd
in
i
ve
had
some
smart
people
tell
me
that
venezuela
s
production
could
go
to
zero
if
there
is
a
military
coup
and
the
chances
of
that
happening
goes
up
each

pdvsa
the
government
s
oil
company
recently
announced
that
two
of
their
four
oil
upgraders
had
to
be
shut
down
for
maintenance
this
will
take
several
barrels
per
day
off
of
the
is
another
wildcard
rjs
base
assumption
is
that
libyan
production
holds
at
mmbopd
my
view
of
libya
is
that
it
is
a
failed
state
much
like
venezuela
it
is
a
country
run
by
lawless
gangs
as
we
have
seen
several
times
over
the
years
since
moammar
kaddafi
was
killed
in
a
significant
amount
of
libyan
oil
production
can
be
taken
off
the
market
without
notice
anyone
counting
on
a
steady
flow
of
oil
from
libya
has
not
been
paying
much
attention
to
the
news
from
north
rj
s
base
assumption
is
that
president
trump
s
sanctions
against
iran
will
take
bopd
off
the
market
obviously
this
is
a
wildcard
and
the
actual
amount
could
be
a
lot
higher
my
opinion
is
that
trump
is
serious
about
iran
and
the
sanctions
will
take
more
than
bopd
off
the
market
in
early
direct
military
conflict
between
the
and
iran
will
quickly
push
oil
over
a
is
not
a
threat
to
oversupply
the
oil
market
that
many
on
wall
street
believe
it
is
in
november
they
drained
the
tanks
to
artificially
jack
up
production
before
the
vienna
agreement
russian
growth
will
be
bopd
per
summary
can
not
increase
production
even
if
they
wanted
to
do
so
and
it
is
certainly
not
in
their
best
interest
to
do
anything
that
will
lower
oil
lack
of
production
declinesinvestors
often
forget
that
outside
of
the
and
opec
the
rest
of
the
world
produces
more
than
of
global
oil
supply
most
of
the
countries
don
t
produce
enough
oil
to
meet
their
own
demand
and
like

they
are
heavily
dependent
on

there

this

even
when

hogwash

conclusion
global

for

exceeds

by
more

oecd
crude

inventories

the

of

texas
intermediate
wti
is
expected
to

than
for
at
least
the
next
three
quarter
chances
are
that
conditions
in
venezuela
and
the
impact
of
sanctions
against
iran
will
take
another
million
barrels
of
oil
supply
off
the
prediction
oil

cycles
always
overshoot
the
