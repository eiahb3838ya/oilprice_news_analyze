is it time to go long on crude?
last
week
i
wrote
that
i
expected
a
bounce
in
crude
before
long
and
as
wti
has
continued
to
fall
the
trolls
have
had
a
field
day
pointing
out
that
i
was
wrong
let
s
for
a
minute
not
dwell
on
the
fact
that
i
said
it
may
not
happen
immediately
and
assume
that
it
was
simply
a
wrong
call
i
can
only
assume
that
those
pointing
that
out
have
never
traded
or
are
new
to
it
as
a
pastime
the
simple
fact
is
that
in
a
dealing
room
pointing
out
that
somebody
got
a
call
wrong
is
like
pointing
out
that
they
are
breathing
getting
things
wrong
is
an
everyday
or
rather
many
times
every
day
occurrence
what
defines
you
is
how
you
deal
with
it
and
what
you
do
that
means
simply
changing
your
view
to
do
that
involves
understanding
something
market
can
never
be
wrong
i
was
taught
early
in
my
dealing
room
career
that
while
you
may
believe
that
the
market
is
missing
something
important
or
misinterpreting
some
information
the
price
is
simply
an
expression
of
the
last
point
at
which
two
counterparties
were
prepared
to
transact
as
such
it
can
t
be
wrong
that
is
encapsulated
in
the
old
saying
that
the
market
can
stay
illogical
a
lot
longer
than
you
can
stay
this
case
though
while
i
understand
that
the
market
isn
t
wrong
i
do
believe
that
fundamental
and
technical
factors
combine
to
make
a
rapid
reversal
likely
at
some
point
soon
and
am
therefore
prepared
to
have
another
crack
