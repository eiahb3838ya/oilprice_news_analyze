opec+ proposes 1-million-bpd production increase
update
opec
chairman
kachikwu
says
that
will
add
bpd
real
barrels
the
joint
ministerial
monitoring
committee
of
opec
russia
and
the
other
partners
has
proposed
a
production
increase
of
million
barrels
daily
russia
s
energy
minister
alexander
novak
told
media
in
vienna
after
the
june
meeting
of
the
number
was
made
public
about
a
month
ago
but
there
were
doubts
that
some
opec
members
would
back
such
a
large
increase
in
production
most
of
these
doubts
have
been
dispelled
now
it
reports
that
after
a
night
of
drama
the
ministerial
committee
agreed
on
the
proposal
with
the
notable
exception
of
iran
s
bijan
zanganeh
who
left
the
meeting
early
saying
that
opec
would
not
reach
a
consensus
decision
on
the
increase
at
today
s
figure
is
theoretical
only
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
was
quick
to
note
the
actual
increase
will
likely
be
closer
to
bpd
he
said
as
not
all
opec
members
have
the
spare
capacity
to
raise
production
the
most
obvious
example
here
is
struggling
venezuela
but
iraq
is
also
opposed
to
any
production
increase
mexico
a
but
a
signatory
of
the
deal
also
can
t
boost
its
production
at
the
moment
related
why
opec
wo
flood
the
oil
marketthese
two
will
probably
make
it
harder
for
opec
to
reach
a
decision
today
but
as
history
has
proven
they
will
also
probably
end
up
signing
up
for
the
increase
which
would
leave
iran
as
the
only
opponent
and
effectively
the
since
all
opec
decisions
must
be
so
those
opec
members
that
are
for
the
production
boost
can
regroup
and
start
pumping
more
despite
iran
s
opposition
in
other
words
with
or
without
an
official
opec
consensus
the
production
increase
many
have
been
waiting
for
is
all
but
original
deal
involved
oil
producers
who
agreed
to
take
off
million
bpd
from
the
market
as
of
may
however
thanks
to
production
declines
in
venezuela
and
several
african
producers
compliance
to
the
deal
reached
percent
setting
the
stage
for
a
change
of
tack
towards
global
oil
market
