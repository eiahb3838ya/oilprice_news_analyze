underwhelming opec fuels oil price rally
oil
prices
rose
on
monday
on
news
that
opec
only
added
a
modest
amount
of
additional
supply
to
the
market
in
september
contrary
to
previous
arabia
had
promised
that
it
would
ramp
up
oil
production
in
september
and
again
in
october
despite
the
from
on
an
official
increase
in
output
however
a
report
from
reuters
suggests
that
while
riyadh
followed
through
on
this
pledge
last
month
it
only
added
a
relatively
modest
barrels
per
day
compared
to
august
fact
all
of
opec
produced
million
barrels
per
day
in
september
an
increase
of
only
bpd
on
net
compared
to
a
month
earlier
the
gains
were
largely
possible
only
because
of
the
restoration
in
output
from
libya
where
production
jumped
above
you
exclude
libya
from
the
equation
since
libya
is
not
part
of
the
binding
production
cut
deal
the
compliance
with
the
output
limits
rose
from
percent
to
percent
in
september
in
terms
of
production
volumes
that
translates
into
a
was
still
able
to
increase
production
with
the
help
of
libya
but
market
concerns
about
supply
tightness
were
hardly
put
to
rest
after
all
libya
s
increase
is
likely
a
a
restoration
of
disrupted
output
from
prior
months
and
the
ongoing
conflict
in
the
country
means
that
there
is
always
a
risk
of
more
disruptions
nigeria
also
resolved
some
outages
adding
roughly
bpd
last
month
reuters
noted
that
angola
increased
production
in
september
on
the
startup
of
a
new
field
although
the
country
s
production
level
is
still
far
below
its
allotted
limit
as
part
of
the

meaningful
increases
in
supply

they
will
be

replicate

reaching
a
boiling
pointas
a
result
the
main
focus
for
the
oil
market
over
the
next
few
weeks
will
be
on
the
tension
between
falling
supplies
from
iran
and
venezuela
versus
the
increase
in
supply
from
saudi

saudi

increase
in

was
outweighed
by
the

were
a
few
other
pieces
of
news
that
may
have
played
a
role

evidence

this

the

remains
to
be
seen
if
this
scenario
plays
out
but
the
loss
of
of

would
be
very
hard

cover
opec
would
struggle
to
compensate
for
a
loss
of
this
size

if
it

spare
