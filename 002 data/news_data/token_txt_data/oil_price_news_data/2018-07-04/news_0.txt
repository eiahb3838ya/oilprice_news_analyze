trump is fracturing opec
president
trump
is
fracturing
s
tweet
over
the
weekend
that
saudi
arabia
agreed
to
add
million
barrels
per
day
of
supply
confused
the
oil
markets
pushing
prices
down
a
bit
on
monday
most
analysts
dismissed
the
statement
concluding
that
trump
was
confused
when
the
saudis
told
him
they
have
of
spare
capacity
and
not
that
they
had
planned
to
bring
that
capacity
few
days
on
from
that
episode
however
it
actually
doesn
t
look
that
black
and
trump
s
tweet
suggests
that
he
very
much
believes
that
of
saudi
supply
is
coming
online
and
despite
the
attempt
by
the
saudis
to
clarify
by
stating
that
they
have
surplus
capacity
waiting
to
be
used
in
the
event
of
a
pinch
the
statement
was
interpreted
in
different
ways
by
the
oil
all
the
point
of
saudi
arabia
s
spare
capacity
has
always
been
to
ensure
market
stability
so
it
doesn
t
seem
as
if
there
is
any
major
change
in
policy
on
the
other
hand
many
oil
market
watchers
viewed
the
statement
as
saudi
arabia
s
tacit
agreement
with
the
trump
administration
to
ramp
up
supply
when
iranian
oil
goes
data
suggests
that
saudi
arabia
already
began
ramping
up
production
way
more
than
it
said
it
would
under
the
agreement
even
before
the
meeting
the
agreement
called
for
a
return
to
percent
compliance
which
would
translate
into
an
increase
of
bpd
to
saudi
officials
suggested
the
upper
end
of
that
range
was
almost
a
formality
and
the
lower
figure
would
end
up
being
what
was
even
as
saudi
arabia
worked
hard
to
maintain
the
cohesion
of
the
group
it
quietly
ramped
up
output
in
june
estimates
vary
but
here
are
a
few
numbers
that
we
have
to
go
by
bloomberg
estimates
saudi
output
jumped
by
bpd
in
june
to
reuters
says
production
surged
by
much
more
rising
by
bpd
to
if
the
latter
is
true
production
would
stand
at
close
to
the
high
of
around

the
new
oil
cartel

opeclooking
forward
bloomberg
and
reuters
both

that
saudi
arabia
won
t
stop
there
and
instead
will
ramp
up
to
or
in
numbers
are
significant
because
they
would
suggest
that
even
as
saudi
arabia
cobbled
together
a
reasonable
deal
in
vienna
it
had
plans
to
blow
through
the
ceiling
that
it
was
committing
to
in
other
words
agreed
to
add
but
saudi
arabia
alone
is
poised
to
increase
by
that
opec
members
are
already
crying
foul
accusing
saudi
arabia
of
doing
trump
s
bidding
it
isn
t
clear
that
saudi
arabia
will
go
as
far
as
increasing
by
as
trump
wants
but
the
promise
to
plug
any
supply
gap
is
a
acknowledgement
that
riyadh
is
ready
backstop
washington
s
plan
to
shut

that

s
interventions
are

likely

in

the
comments
carry
the
implicit
suggestions
that
supply
deficits
will
require
all
of
the
world
s
remaining
spare
production
capacity
to
come
online
that
us
oil
policy
is
based
primarily
on
the
use
of
saudi
spare
capacity
to
fill
any
gaps
created
by
other

actions
and
that
the
us

there
is
as
much
as
available
iran
is
firing
back
arguing
that
if
saudi
arabia
produces
above
its
quota
it
would
breach
the
agreement
iran
also

threat

many
opec
members
wounded
they
are
largely
powerless
to
stop
saudi
arabia
from
pursuing
its
own
course
plus
with
russian
cooperation
saudi
arabia
no
longer
sees
the
utility
in
restraining
its
ambitions
to
adhere
to
the
wishes
of
other
opec
the
aggressive
campaign
from
washington
a
campaign
that
riyadh
supports
is
driving
a
wedge
between
opec
members
putting
aside
the
fact
that
saudi
arabia
has
no
such
capacity
to
bolster
its
crude
output
this
demand
could
be
inferred
as
an
order
for
the
kingdom
to
walk
out

whether
saudi

and
russia
and
to

a

the
