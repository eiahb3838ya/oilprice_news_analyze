what trump’s tweet actually means for oil
after
a
weekend
of
turmoil
largely
caused
by
president
trump
s
twitter
diplomacy
the
international
oil
cartel
could
soon
be
facing
a
new
previously
reported
saudi
arabia
and
iran
have
been
on
a
collision
course
since
the
recent
vienna
meeting
tehran
has
openly
opposed
the
oil
production
increase
but
was
willing
to
compromise
based
on
an
understanding
that
opec
members
would
fall
below
a
percent
compliance
rate
in
the
existing
agreement
at
the
same
time
saudi
arabia
the
largest
spare
production
capacity
holder
seemed
to
be
reluctant
to
flood
the
market
right
away
a
consensus
was
found
in
which
opec
members
could
produce
more
by
filling
the
gaps
in
supply
caused
by
the
sanctions
on
iran
and
falling
venezuelan
supply
disruptions
have
been
far
greater
than
opec
had
originally
prepared
for
with
the
recent
force
majeur
in
libya
being
an
example
of
that
some
analysts
believed
that
a
small
opec
increase
would
be
enough
to
stabilize
the
market
without
putting
extreme
pressure
on
prices
in
their
opinion
saudi
spare
capacity
alongside
the
shale
oil
boom
should
have
been
enough
to
counter
any
mishap
in
the
narrative
was
taken
as
a
fact
by
the
mainstream
media
and
western
political
leaders
with
trump
being
one
of
its
main
supporters
the
idea
of
ever
increasing
shale
oil
production
which
would
help
balance
out
the
markets
was
supported
by
the
myth
of
energy
independency
and
global
energy
was
considered
a
caretaker
that
would
only
be
used
once
all
other
options
ran
out
but
washington
s
dream
of
energy
dependence
dominating
the
global
oil
market
has
evaporated
with
a
tweet
of
less
than
words
trump
s
tweet
indicating
that
he
had
asked
saudi
king
salman
to
raise
production
by
million
bpd
can
be
seen
as
an
admission
of
the
dependence
on
opec
it
can
be
read
as
the
president
officially
admiting
that
the
is
not
able
to
counter
the
expected
removal
of
iran
s
oil
export
volumes
with
its
own
shale
production
boom
in
order
to
mitigate
the
damage
the
state
department
soon
responded
with
its
own
assessment
of
the
between
the
two
leaders
related
libya
stops
pumping
oilsaudi
reactions
until
now
have
been
muted
officials
have
reiterated
that
trump
s
views
are
being
noted
as
a
concern
but
decisions
are
being
made
from
within
opec
not
by
outsiders
still
volatility
has
shot
up
resulting
in
doubts
on
all
fronts
about
the
stability
of
opec
as
a
group
the
viability
of
the
vienna
agreement
the
role
of
iran
and
the
overall
spare
production
capacity
available
on
the
markets
this
doubt
over
spare
production
capacity
is
now
sure
to
be
an
unexpected
boon
for
deal
within
opec
is
needed
soon
to
counter
the
possibility
of
a
real
price
hike
as
millions
of
barrels
per
day
of
oil
are
expected
to
leave
the
market
before
the
end
of
in
fact
crunch
time
may
have
already
arrrived
with
libyan
oil
production
constraints
growing
and
the
specter
of
a
prolonged
war
pushing
still
more
uncertainty
the
deal
from
vienna
already
seems
irrelevant
not
just
due
to
the
iranian
hardline
opposition
but
due
to
geopolitical
first
priority
at
present
will
need
to
be
to
counter
unrest
in
the
market
and
fill
up
any
supply
gap
caused
by
libya
at
the
same
time
opec
s
secretary
general
barkindo
and
opec
chairman
mazrouei
need
to
find
a
solution
to
prevent
iran
from
hijacking
the
market
tehran
has
already
been
calling
for
a
possible
emergency
meeting
if
this
comes
to
fruition
within
the
next
weeks
prices
will
be
shooting
through
the
roof
iran
is
also
facing
another
issue
with
internal
unrest
destabilizing
the
country
the
only
financial
for
the
islamic
republic
seems
to
be
oil
and
gas
analysts
should
keep
an
eye
on
these
reports
as
it
will
fuel
the
confrontation
within
opec
for
the
only
way
at
present
to
be
clear
about
oil
politics
is
maybe
to
be
a
twitter
addict
trump
s
usage
of
this
internet
phenomena
is
already
causing
havoc
what
is
notable
however
is
that
by
blaming
opec
for
manipulating
the
oil
market
the
president
appears
to
be
admitting
that
shale
oil
is
still
not
the
power
player
it
is
depicted
as
being
the
future
of
shale
oil
was
already
in
doubt
and
trump
latest
tweet
just
adds
fuel
to
that
fire
the
blaming
opec
for
pushing
oil
prices
up
is
somewhat
ironic
in
itself
and
the
largest
catalyst
for
oil
prices
has
been
the
leaving
of
the
iran
deal
by
the
if
analysts
are
to
read
trump
latest
tweet
as
an
admission
that
shale
is
unable
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
iranian
oil
prices
will
be
given
yet
another
boost
related
oil
rig
count
falls
amid
stagnating
productionat
the
same
time
trump
latest
actions
could
be
undermining
opec
by
emphasizing
the
power
and
importance
of
the
oil
cartel
opec
is
being
forced
to
show
its
cards
saudi
arabia
has
been
pushed
into
a
corner
as
they
are
now
the
one
source
that
most
observers
will
be
watching
to
bring
more
production
online
the
need
for
additional
volumes
is
clear
in
the
coming
weeks
riyadh
will
need
to
open
up
every
resource
valve
and
storage
tank
to
keep
up
the
dream
of
a
oil
market
whatever
happens
if
they
can
t
manage
to
do
this
saudi
arabia
and
opec
could
be
about
to
face
a
broader
crisis
a
shortage
on
the
supply
side
is
not
what
all
parties
are
currently
vying
for
prices
should
stabilize
around
per
barrel
leaving
enough
room
for
economic
growth
trump
s
tweet
has
now
broken
this
per
barrel
upper
shale
oil
is
most
probably
smiling
as
their
production
horizon
is
based
a
quick
buck
is
better
than
supply
security
for
opec
russia
and
the
global
economy
a
stable
price
is
a
necessity
trump
s
tweets
however
are
causing
total
destruction
including
for
his
own
voters
