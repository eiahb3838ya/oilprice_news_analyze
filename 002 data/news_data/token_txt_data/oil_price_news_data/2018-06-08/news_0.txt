geopolitical tensions reach boiling point ahead of opec meeting
the
upcoming
opec
meeting
on
june
is
shaping
up
to
be
a
contentious
one
after
news
broke
that
the
government
asked
saudi
arabia
to
increase
oil
production
before
washington
pulled
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
last
week
news
surfaced
that
the
government
asked
saudi
arabia
to
boost
output
to
relieve
pressure
on
prices
but
reuters
followed
up
with
a
report
on
june
adding
more
context
to
that
story
according
to
reuters
a
high
level
trump
administration
official
called
saudi
arabia
a
day
before
trump
was
set
to
announce
the
withdrawal
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
asking
for
more
oil
supply
to
cover
for
disruptions
from
last
time
the
government
pressured
opec
into
adding
supply
it
was
also
over
iran
the
obama
administration
wanted
the
cartel
to
offset
disrupted
iranian
production
after
an
international
coalition
put
stringent
sanctions
on
iran
in
roughly
million
barrels
per
day
were
knocked
the
trump
administration
s
request
might
irk
opec
members
with
iran
obviously
the
most
aggrieved
the
apparent
willingness
of
saudi
arabia
to
comply
with
washington
s
request
has
ignited
furor
from
within
the
it
s
crazy
and
astonishing
to
see
instruction
coming
from
washington
to
saudi
to
act
and
replace
a
shortfall
of
iran
s
export
due
to
their
illegal
sanction
on
iran
and
venezuela
iran
s
opec
governor
hossein
kazempour
ardebili
said
in
comments
to
reuters
he
said
that
opec
would
not
simply
comply
with
washington
s
requests
no
one
in
opec
will
act
against
two
of
its
founder
members
he
said
referring
to
iran
and
venezuela
the
tried
it
last
time
against
iran
but
oil
prices
got
to
a
opec
will
not
accept
such
a
humiliation
how
arrogant
and
ignorant
one
could
be
to
underestimate
the
history
of
years
cooperation
among
competitors
he
wrote
to
opec
members
asking
them
to
denounce
sanctions
a
request
similar
to
the
one
iran
made
recently
i
kindly
request
solidarity
and
support
from
our
fellow
members
venezuelan
oil
minister
manuel
quevedo
wrote
the
group
should
discuss
the
constraining
effects
of
unilateral
sanctions
imposed
by
the
united
states
of
america
which
represent
an
extraordinary
aggression
financially
and
economically
for
our
national
oil
industry
s
operations
and
the
stability
of
the
the
comments
suggest
that
a
good
portion
of
the
cartel
is
lining
up
against
any
move
to
increase
production
it
could
set
the
stage
for
a
heated
meeting
in
vienna
in
two
weeks
time
it
might
be
one
of
the
worst
opec
meetings
since
eugen
weinberg
of
commerzbank
told
will
saudi
arabia
listen
to
demands
for
more
oil
he
was
referring
to
the
infamous
meeting
that
fell
apart
over
sharp
differences
in
opinion
with
saudi
arabia
wanting
to
increase
production
to
ease
oil
prices
following
the
conflagration
in
parts
of
north
africa
and
the
middle
east
during
the
arab
spring
but
the
saudis
were
shot
down
by
much
of
the
rest
of
the
group
which
opposed
lifting
output
former
saudi
oil
minister
ali
said
it
was
one
of
the
worst
meetings
we
have
ever
although
not
exactly
the
same
the
differences
back
then
echo
those
of
today
saudi
arabia
wary
of
hurting
global
economic
growth
and
also
cautious
about
not
incentivizing
too
much
supply
wants
to
add
some
barrels
back
onto
the
about
every
opec
member
outside
of
the
gulf
is
unable
to
increase
production
anyway
so
it
is
of
little
surprise
that
they
are
opposed
to
higher
production
venezuela
s
output
is
falling
fast
angola
is
also
losing
production
libya
and
nigeria
seemed
to
have
hit
a
temporary
ceiling
with
security
issues
always
looming
as
a
supply
risk
also
they
don
t
have
official
limits
on
their
output
as
part
of
the
opec
deal
so
there
is
little
upside
for
them
in
supporting
production
increases
from
other
obviously
is
facing
production
outages
from
sanctions
so
it
likely
can
t
increase
output
even
if
it
wanted
to
officials
from
iraq
and
algeria
made
negative
comments
over
the
past
week
about
the
possibility
of
higher
the
camp
mexico
s
production
is
falling
anyway
so
it
has
little
to
no
ability
to
respond
to
change
in
the
only
beneficiaries
of
higher
production
would
be
saudi
arabia
and
russia
and
to
a
lesser
extent
some
of
the
gulf
states
like
kuwait
and
the
oil
kingdom
in
crisis
saudi
royal
family
rift
turns
violentbut
saudi
arabia
and
russia
probably
can
t
simply
allot
themselves
more
production
allowances
without
risking
a
revolt
from
the
rest
of
the
group
so
they
will
likely
need
to
allocate
more
production
to
everyone
but
even
the
act
of
deciding
on
a
formula
will
also
be
highly
contentious
still
it
will
be
somewhat
of
a
formality
for
most
members
since
they
can
t
increase
production
there
are
a
few
possibilities
from
the
upcoming
meeting
first
saudi
arabia
and
russia
convince
the
group
to
agree
to
an
increase
in
output
and
while
everyone
nominally
is
allowed
to
increase
output
a
bit
the
two
top
producers
make
up
the
lion
s
share
of
the
increase
that
will
require
sacrifice
from
much
of
the
group
who
won
t
be
able
to
increase
production
and
will
have
to
stomach
lower
oil
possibility
is
a
breakdown
in
negotiations
and
saudi
arabia
and
russia
go
their
own
way
increasing
output
or
talks
could
breakdown
and
there
is
no
change
in
output
although
with
the
upside
risk
to
prices
this
seems
the
outcome
odds
are
that
the
upcoming
meeting
is
the
most
combative
we
have
seen
