the
latest
port
blockade
in
libya
which
had
sent
the
country
s
oil
production
plunging
and
oil
prices
surging
was
lifted
last

with
new
promises
of
transparency
and
the
fair
distribution

politicians

after
a
week
of
fighting
handing
their

to
an
unrecognized

in

nearly
all

agreement
that
resulted
in
libya
reopening
its
ports
last
week
and
beginning
to
restore
the

lost
during
the

was
backed
by
the
united

france
italy
the
uk
and
the
united
part
of
the
agreement
the
governments
agreed
that
there
should
be
a
corruption
probe
under
the
auspices
of
the

newspaper
the
independent

citing

close

authorities
related
who
actually
benefits
from
sanctions
on
iran
according
to
the
independent
s
sources
in
the
uk
foreign
office
there
wasn
t
a
firm
agreement
between
the
parties
although
libyan
sources
said
that
everyone
around
the
table
said
it
was
a
good
idea
with
france
the
uae
and
egypt
reportedly
being
in
favor
of
such
a
haftar
and
his
allies
claim
that
libya
s
oil
money
is
being
mismanaged
stolen
or
channeled
to
extremist
groups
the
accusations
are
mostly
directed
to
the
central
bank
of
libya
at
a
meeting
with
the
foreign
governments
in
rome
that
later
led
to
the
agreement
for
returning

side
quoted
allegations
of
abuse
of
power
and
corruption
at
the
central
bank
of
libya
that
it
wanted
investigated
according
to
the
independent
s
bank
governor
saddek
elkaber
for
his
part
has
accused
libyan
governments
of
using
the
central
bank
as
a
scapegoat
for
their
own
mismanagement
and
latest
agreement
that
lifted
the
oil
port
blockade
may
lead
to
a
corruption
probe
but
any
new
deal
on
oil
wealth
distribution
must
tackle
the
structural
corruption
problems
in
libya
analysts
new
agreement
must
not
simply
be
a
new
agreement
on
who
is
allowed
to
steal
from
the
state
but
one
that
protects
state
spending
from
predation

it

brought
to
the

the

plague
the

which
i
have
repeatedly
outlined
to
this
council
namely
frustrations
with
regards
to
the
distribution
of
wealth
and
the
endemic
plundering
of

these
matters
are
not
expeditiously
addressed
i
fear
the
agreements
made

not

it
will
be
difficult
to
advance

process

if
there
has
been
a
silver
lining
in

it
is
that
