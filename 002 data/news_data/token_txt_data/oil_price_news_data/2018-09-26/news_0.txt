what peak oil demand, copper and 3d printing have in common
the
debate
about
peak
oil
demand
pod
will
likely
rage
on
for
quite
some
time
years
ago
peak
oil
theories
on
production
and
supply
were
constantly
thrown
around
for
general
consumption
there
was
even
an
association
for
the
study
of
peak
oil
it
seemed
to
culminate
with
the
release
of
syriana
in
staring
george
clooney
and
matt
damon
a
few
years
later
the
shale
revolution
began
and
economic
potential
of
other
large
unconventional
assets
like
alberta
s
oil
sands
entered
public
view
many
peak
oil
supply
and
production
theories
were
put
to
rest
because
oil
is
much
more
abundant
and
economically
accessible
than
originally
fiasco
of
peak
oil
theories
showed
the
need
to
point
a
critical
eye
to
underlying
assumptions
of
crafted
narratives
about
future
energy
markets
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
do
the
same
with
pod
there
are
serious
questions
about
the
nature
of
pod
and
the
supposed
transition
away
from
greenhouse
gas
ghg
intensive
fuels
that
need
to
be
explored
so
please
ponder
the
following
copper
producers
effectively
supply
electrification
of
the
transportation
sector
in
the
coming
decades
rio
tinto
emr
capital
and
bmo
capital
markets
have
all
expressed
concern
about
copper
supply
in
the
coming
decades
earlier
this
year
cru
analyst
hamish
sampson
provided
a
stark
supply
outlook
stating
that
only
if
every
single
copper
project
currently
in
development
or
being
studied
for
feasibility
is
brought
online
before
then
including
most
discoveries
that
have
not
yet
reached
the
evaluation
stage
the
market
could
meet
projected
the
forecast
suggests
that
copper
production
could
plummet
from
current
levels
of
roughly
million
metric
tons
per
year
to
just
million
in
two
hundred
copper
mines
are
expected
to
reach
their
productive
by
related
oil
increased
investment
or
demand
destruction
even
though
copper
is
highly
recyclable
new
production
is
required
due
to
an
increasing
global
population
and
the
fact
it
is
trapped
in
end
uses
like
piping
and
wiring
for
decades
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
pod
potentially
lots
for
example
if
the
appropriate
charging
infrastructure
can
not
be
built
demand
for
electric
vehicles
evs
could
be
stunted
for
years
afterall
if
individual
consumers
and
businesses
can
not
have
a
predictable
easily
accessible
way
to
power
their
vehicles
at
a
price
why
would
they
purchase
a
ev
in
addition
evs
require
significantly
more
copper
a
conventional
vehicles
contains
up
to
kilograms
whereas
hybrids
and
only
evs
require
up
to
and
kilograms
this
is
why
shinzuo
abe
toyota
s
powertrain
general
manager
is
skeptical
of
evs
making
a
major
breakthrough
before
without
the
proper
charging
infrastructure
in
place
the
market
can
not
adopt
them
unless
direct
solar
powered
evs
like
the
sion
make
a
significant
splash
in
the
market
however
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
solar
powered
vehicles
can
be
made
practical
enough
to
be
globally
there
is
also
the
fact
that
in
mining
discovery
to
production
lead
times
have
increased
substantially
in
last
two
decades
between
and
leads
times
hovered
around
years
between
and
lead
times
were
not
less
that
years
less
ideal
geology
is
considered
one
major
factor
as
the
highly
quality
deposits
are
becoming
scarcer
of
course
if
vehicles
like
the
sion
become
viable
enough
it
could
offset
of
the
demand
for
charging
infrastructure
we
shall
wait
and
not
used
for
refined
fuels
how
much
oil
will
be
pushed
into
other
markets
supply
chains
connect
industries
however
resource
inputs
to
supply
chains
often
compete
with
each
other
supply
chains
evolve
in
part
as
demands
of
end
users
change
in
for
example
vehicles
contained
a
lot
more
metals
than
they
currently
do
auto
manufacturers
have
gradually
increased
the
proportion
of
plastics
to
metals
cost
fuel
efficiency
and
customer
preferences
have
made
it
practical
for
auto
manufactures
to
do
so
that
trend
appears
to
continue
as
printed
cars
like
the
lsev
enter
mass
production
in
the
coming
traders
turn
bullish
ahead
of
iran
sanctionsif
oil
isn
t
being
refined
into
fuels
it
may
open
the
door
for
uses
in
other
parts
of
the
market
that
are
inefficient
and
expensive
afterall
could
there
not
be
opportunities
from
a
potential
abundance
of
cheap
petrochemical
feedstock
possibly
could
it
give
manufacturers
and
builders
a
reason
to
ponder
their
supply
chain
inputs
and
to
rejig
to
cheaper
more
effective
inputs
simple
internet
search
will
generate
pages
of
printing
applications
including
replacement
dog
skulls
guns
homes
furniture
door
handles
shoes
and
faucets
uptake
of
additive
manufacturing
is
underway
and
implications
for
individual
consumers
and
manufacturers
could
be
substantial
although
materials
that
comprise
printed
objects
are
highly
varied
oil
and
natural
inputs
are
significant
oil
producers
would
be
more
than
happy
to
see
their
products
enter
new
supply
chains
via
petrochemicals
and
through
printing
if
it
s
not
being
used
as
a
fuel
it
could
go
elsewhere
after
all
the
global
population
is
increasing
so
too
are
the
resource
needs
of
emerging
economies
petrochemicals
will
play
a
major
part
in
resourcing
these
peak
oil
production
and
supply
theories
it
is
very
important
to
challenge
carefully
crafted
narratives
about
pod
by
asking
the
right
questions
and
finding
evidence
to
answer
these
questions
will
there
be
enough
copper
how
much
can
fuel
efficiency
improve
in
the
coming
decades
where
else
can
oil
go
there
are
others
lots
of
them
the
world
may
only
be
a
few
years
away
from
getting
more
substantive
answers
about
pod
perhaps
it
s
a
good
time
to
make
a
movie
about
it
