strong demand, not opec, is pushing oil prices higher
the
rally
in
oil
prices
over
the
past
year
likely
had
more
to
do
with
higher
demand
rather
than
merely
the
supply
taken
off
of
the
market
by
the
cuts
that
suggests
that
as
opec
tries
to
formulate
a
strategy
going
forward
perhaps
targeting
a
certain
price
level
much
of
the
success
of
that
campaign
will
depend
on
the
global
economy
and
the
pace

conclusion
comes
from
a
new
report
published
by

institute

the
report
parses
out
some
of
the
variables
determining

in
recent
years
dividing
the
recent
past
into
four
main
cycles
opec

high
strategy
to
drive
out
shale
cuts
june
and
opec
s
strategy
to
drain
stocks
may
these
four
stages
one
interesting
conclusion
is
that
the
demand
story
is
incredibly
important
arguably
more
important
than
the
market
realizes
in
driving
the
price
of
crude
the
last
the
focus
in
the
media
and
among
analysts
is
usually
on
the
supply
picture
shale
growth
for
instance
or
the
opec
cuts
but
evidence
suggests
a
slowdown
in
demand
or
unexpected
strength
tends
to
have
just
as
much
influence

in
an
effort
to
defend
market
share
and
drive
shale
producers
out
of
business
the
high
levels
of
supply
were
definitely
a
key
driver
in
the
crash
in
oil
prices
but
the
demand
story
was
also
important

that

lost
roughly
per

due
to
the
combined
tidal

of

and

opec

still
it
wasn

just
a
supply
story
the

in

euphoria
wore

in

over

period
which
is
notable
because

the
effect

adding

timeframe
again
a

in

four
to

the

picture
has
been
muddled
because
much
higher
opec
compliance
has
been
occurring
at
a
time
when
shale
was
ramping
up
oies
estimates
that
shale
growth
probably
depressed
prices
by

in
while
higher
opec
compliance
added
per
barrel
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
the
opec
cuts
had
very
little
effect
because
of
poor
compliance
and
and
shale
somewhat
offset
each
other
in
but
the
crucial
message
from
the

time

economy
sputtered

the

timing
led
to

an
