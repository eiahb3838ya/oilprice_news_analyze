oil’s perfect storm lays at trump’s feet
it
s
becoming
painfully
clear
that
the
way
forward
for
global
oil
markets
is
going
to
be
bumpy
very
bumpy
particularly
as
we
head
into
next
year
much
of
this
uncertainty
even
blame
is
being
increasingly
leveled
at
a
person
that
has
surprised
flabbergasted
and
even
shocked
political
opponents
allies
and
adversaries
alike
since
he
took
office
president
donald
growing
line
of
thought
surmises
that
while
trump
uses
the
presidential
bully
pulpit
in
this
case
twitter
to
put
pressure
on
ally
and
de
facto
opec
leader
saudi
arabia
to
get
ready
to
pump
more
oil
to
keep
both
oil
and
gas
prices
from
spiraling
out
of
control
much
of
the
blame
for
higher
prices
actually
belong
to
argument
makes
perfect
sense
if
trump
would
ease
back
on
both
his
heated
rhetoric
toward
iran
though
that
case
could
be
made
over
much
of
trump
s
dealings
with
china
the
eu
canada
and
others
and
if
trump
would
revisit
his
decision
on
sanctions
on
iran
then
oil
markets
would
benefit
why
a
softer
line
on
iran
would
reduce
the
worry
or
even
fear
that
a
loss
of
some
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
iranian
crude
would
roil
oil
markets
so
much
that
the
saudis
would
have
to
pump
an
unprecedented
amount
of
oil
perhaps
as
much
as
million
bpd
eating
up
all
of
its
spare
saudi
s
have
never
pumped
more
than
around
million
bpd
of
oil
a
level
reached
in
june
and
has
for
more
than
years
kept
at
least
million
bpd
of
spare
capacity
for
oil
market
management
related
a
storm
is
brewing
for
oil
exportsunder
such
a
scenario
global
oil
markets
would
be
dangerously
exposed
to
any
oil
increases
as
well
as
geopolitical
developments
that
always
take
aim
at
global
oil
markets
a
recent
bloomberg
article
articulated
the
problem
well
it
said
that
the
simple
truth
is
that
there
isn
t
enough
spare
capacity
in
the
world
to
replace
the
complete
loss
of
iranian
saudi
arabia
can
boost
output
to
million
bpd
immediately
the
report
added
citing
a
interview
with
saudi
crown
price
mohammed
bin
salman
it
can
also
go
to
million
in
six
to
nine
months
bloomberg
added
but
the
prince
has
said
nothing
since
then
to
suggest
the
figures
have
s
thinking
called
into
questionhowever
all
of
this
seems
to
be
lost
on
trump
with
november
elections
approaching
and
decisive
house
and
senate
seats
in
contention
much
of
the
second
half
of
the
president
s
term
could
be
jeopardized
if
higher
gas
prices
amid
higher
oil
prices
eat
into
voters
pocket
books
and
they
take
their
frustration
out
at
the
polls
trump
s
only
plan
appears
to
put
undue
perhaps
geopolitically
damaging
pressure
on
the
saudis
to
make
up
for
anticipated
lost
barrels
when
the
saudis
likely
can
t
do
it
alone
related
opec
won
t
take
additional
action
as
oil
prices
riseit
s
also
apparent
that
trump
has
taken
an
emboldened
stance
with
the
saudis
since
its
riyadh
who
was
instrumental
in
trump
s
decision
to
iranian
oil
production
problems
persisting
in
libya
and
in
venezuela
and
with
those
problems
likely
to
carry
into
the
fall
election
season
and
beyond
trump
is
playing
a
dangerous
game
and
could
find
his
back
against
the
wall
voter
angst
in
november
would
also
spill
over
into
the
upcoming
presidential
election
season
consequently
the
campaign
slogan
of

in

there
