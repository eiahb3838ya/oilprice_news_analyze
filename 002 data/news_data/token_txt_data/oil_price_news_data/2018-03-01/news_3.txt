exxon withdraws from most russian exploration projects
exxon
has
decided
to
withdraw
from
most
of
its
joint
oil
and
gas
exploration
activities
with
russian
rosneft
giving
in
to
the
pressure
of
and
eu
sanctions
against
russia
s
energy
industry
the
decision
exxon
said
was
made
last
year
after
washington
imposed
additional
sanctions
on
russia
for
its
alleged
involvement
in
the
presidential
elections
the
withdrawal
process
will
begin
this
supermajor
said
it
will
book
an
charge
of
us
million
from
the
move
but
as
bloomberg
notes
the
negative
effect
will
by
no
means
be
limited
to
this
charge
the
joint
projects
spanned
millions
of
acres
of
untapped
oil
and
gas
resources
that
would
have
been
instrumental
in
ensuring
exxon
s
production
growth
one
joint
project
on
sakhalin
island
which
began
earlier
than
when
the
other
exploration
deals
were
inked
will
remain
production
from
the
company
s
fields
across
the
world
has
been
falling
steadily
over
the
past
six
years
with
annual
declines
booked
in
five
of
them
to
stymie
or
even
reverse
this
decline
the
company
looked
to
russia
but
it
has
also
been
buying
assets
in
the
shale
patch
and
abroad
most
notably
in
brazil
and
brazil
exxon
last
year
won
the
rights
to
develop
oil
blocks
in
the
country

the
giant
partnered
with
petrobras
for
six
of
the
ten
fields
that
together
fetched
a

for
one
of
the
fields
located
in
the

basin
close
to

exxon
and
petrobras
bid

the
campos
basin
is
one
of

s
most
prolific

expect
oil
prices
to
rise

this
week
exxon
said
that
it
had
made
its
seventh
oil
discovery
offshore
guyana
striking
a
sandstone
reservoir
that
would
be
developed
together
with
the
other
giant
fields
recently
discovered
in
the
area
and
would
bring
guyana
s
oil
production
to

exxon
has
focused
its
attention
on
the
permian
basin
planning
to
triple
its
