that

since
the

is
a

of

more

known
as
shale

many
including
myself
never
imagined
that

could
grow
enough
to
threaten

that
looks
inevitable
at
this

raises
the

just
how
much

tight

increase

between

risksbut
there
s
one
item
that
barely
gets
a
mention
in
the
eia
s
annual
energy
outlook
it
is
something
i
witnessed
firsthand
when
i
was
recently
in
the
permian
basin
oil
production
can
expand
only
as
quickly
as
infrastructure
can
keep
up
and
it
is
struggling
to
keep
s
not
just
crude
oil
pipelines
that
are
an
issue
along
with
oil
comes
associated
natural
gas
in
some
cases
producers
have
no
outlet
for
this
gas
so
they
flare
it
but
there
are
various
legal
limits
to
flaring
this
week
i
heard
about
a
producer
who
is
having
to
reduce
production
because
they
are
bumping
up
against
their
permitted
limits
for
addition
to
potential
infrastructure
constraints
higher
oil
prices
also
lead
to
greater
demand
for
oilfield
services
providers
that
leads
to
higher
costs
for
the
oil
producers
and
higher
profits
for
drilling
and
fracking
services
present
one
of
the
bottlenecks
in
the
permian
basin
is
with
the
fracking
service
providers
and
that
is
leading
to
a
growing
backlog
of
wells
ducs
this
is
helping
to
constrain
production
in
the
permian
basin
but

some

but
these
scenarios
apparently
don
t
consider
supply
risks

by
