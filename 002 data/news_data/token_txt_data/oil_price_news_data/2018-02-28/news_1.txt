should opec and u.s. shale collaborate for survival?
oil
and
gas
is
a
trillion
dollar
industry
and
every
actor
within
it
be
it
national
oil
companies
multinationals
independents
or
oilfield
services
companies
has
a
stake
in
oil
and
gas
flourishing
and
now
these
players
face
an
existential
question
how
will
the
industry
react
to
new
challenges
in
the
shape
of
electric
vehicles
and
renewables
not
long
ago
technological
advancements
led
to
the
rise
of
shale
a
significant
increase
in
shale
oil
and
shale
gas
production
not
only
allowed
the
united
states
to
reduce
its
oil
import
dependency
but
also
influenced
international
oil
prices
this
may
be
good
news
from
a
consumer
perspective
but
it
was
detrimental
for
most
major
oil
producers
particularly
opec
prices
have
fallen
significantly
since
because
of
a
myriad
of
factors
including
a
significant
increase
in
shale
oil
and
gas
production
first
opec
believed
it
could
challenge
this
emerging
enemy
by
ramping
up
oil
production
in
order
to
bankrupt
shale
drillers
however
to
opec
s
surprise
events
did
not
materialize
as
quickly
as
anticipated
eventually
after
a
lag
of
months
there
was
a
plunge
in
shale
output
nevertheless
the
lower
oil
prices
also
severely
affected
the
economies
of
major
oil
producing
countries
which
heavily
rely
on
oil
revenues
in
some
cases
oil
contributes
over
percent
of
their
total
export
revenues
thus
most
of
these
countries
were
looking
for
higher
average
oil
prices
in
order
to
meet
their
national
budgets
and
to
realize
their
respective
visions
a
vision
that
requires
huge
consistent
cash
opec
turned
to
old
practices
cutting
oil
production
in
an
effort
to
revive
oil
prices
a
strong
compliance
has
led
to
a
drop
in
oecd
inventories
from
million
barrels
a
year
ago
to
million
barrels
in
early
consequently
in
last
couple
of
months
oil
prices
have
been
fluctuating
in
has
taught
us
that
nothing
lasts
forever
we
have
seen
the
dominance
of
coal
that
was
once
responsible
for
industrial
revolution
its
role
is
diminishing
not
only
due
to
the
availability
of
new
resources
but
also
due
to
environmental
and
economic
considerations
the
increasing
role
of
oil
demand
in
transport
sector
was
only
possible
due
to
perfection
of
the
internal
combustion
engine
that
revolutionized
the
in
dominance
of
autoindustry
for
over
a
century
allowed
oil
demand
to
thrive
as
the
global
transportation
sector
accounts
for
percent
of
global
oil
demand
road
air
rail
sea
as
such
oil
demand
has
substantially
increased
over
time
and
reached
million
barrels
per
day

trump
s
gas
tax
hike
could
make
californian
fuel
cheaperbased
on
the
historical
trend
population
growth
and
economic
outlook
most
of
the
international
agencies
and
consultants
were
of
the
view
that
oil
demand
would
reach
mmbpd
by
however
as
the
automotive
industry
becomes
more
incentivized
to
build
electric
vehicles
evs
this
is
evs
won
t
replace
all
ices
overnight
that
transformation
would
require
over
decades
therefore
no
one
is
claiming
that
oil
demand
in
road
transportation
in
particular
will
be
wiped
out
suddenly
a
speedy
penetration
of
evs
however
could
lead
to
a
significant
slowdown
in
oil
demand
in
i
wrote
a
paper
will
opec
use
this
strategy
to
defeat
shale
the
analysis
concluded
that
the
shale
oil
industry
is
insensitive
to
changes
in
oil
prices
in
the
but
will
strengthen
in
the
longer
oil
prices
increase
shale
oil
production
increases
and
generally
recovers
the
lost
share
in
production
but
also
surpasses
its
earlier
respective
peaks
the
analysis
in
the
abovementioned
article
could
provide
some
critical
answers
to
opec
offering
some
clues
on
how
the
cartel
could
defend
its
market
share
one
strategy
may
be
to
flip
flop
oil
production
in
order
to
navigate
in
oil
prices
although
this
may
run
counter
to
their
fundamental
policy
for
example
opec
members
could
freeze
oil
production
or
even
decrease
production
and
allow
oil
prices
to
gradually
increase
between
to
for
to
months
lag
to
respond
by
shale
oil
industry
and
then
increase
their
production
for
to
months
to
lower
oil
prices
back
down
to
to
dampen
the
revival
of
shale
oil
production
this
flip
flop
strategy
of
production
will
allow
opec
to
fetch
an
average
of
higher
oil
prices
compared
to
their
strategy
of
solely
defending
market
share
while
at
the
same
time
also
keep
the
shale
oil
revival
in
check
in
however
not
even
this
policy
will
work
due
to
the
significant
increase
in
drilled
but
uncompleted
wells
duc
for
example
the
number
of
duc
s
increased
from
in
december
to
in
january
this
gave
the
shale
oil
industry
a
greater
flexibility
to
respond
promptly
when
wining
goals
collusioninstead
of
going
it
alone
opec
may
decide
to
collaborate
with
the
shale
oil
industry
in
this
partnership
both
parties
have
to
agree
to
some
degree
as
to
how
much
to
produce
in
order
to
achieve
some
reasonable
annual
average
oil
prices
say
between
to
or
even
more
in
theory
this
partnership
could
work
but
many
independent
oil
producers
might
not
see
the
need
to
another
problem
is
how
to
determine
production
quotas
especially
for
shale
oil
producers
it
is
already
difficult
enough
to
control
production
quota
among
the
few
opec
members
how
can
one
expect
oil
majors
and
independent
shale
oil
producers
to
adhere
to
certain
output
quota
if
such
a
strategy
could
somehow
be
realized
but
parties
could
be
trump
s
gas
tax
hike
could
make
californian
fuel
cheapernevertheless
this
policy
has
its
own
negative
implications
higher
oil
prices
may
speed
up
the
penetration
of
evs
as
they
will
encourage
the
autoindustry
find
ways
to
bring
the
production
costs
of
evs
strategies
new
business
structureinstead
of
collusion
the
industry
should
realize
the
facts
and
act
accordingly
the
senior
executives
of
the
major
oil
and
gas
companies
know
the
fate
of
the
oil
industry
very
well
even
though
they
avoid
acknowledging
it
publically
the
shrewd
executives
are
already
in
the
process
of
developing
alternative
strategies
to
remain
in
the
business
maybe
with
a
different
structure
eventually
executives
of
nocs
should
also
realize
that
continued
dependency
on
oil
revenue
alone
could
be
and
may
hold
them
back
from
their
respective
national
visions
the
oil
industry
has
to
develop
alternative
business
models
to
diversify
oil
based
economies
sooner
rather
than
later
