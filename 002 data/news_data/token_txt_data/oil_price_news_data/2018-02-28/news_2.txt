the endless opportunities for u.s. oil exports
once
unthinkable
in
december
the
decided
to
lift
the
nation
s
ban
on
crude
oil
exports
driven
by
a
boom
in
domestic
shale
tight
oil
production
until
then
crude
exports
just
went
to
exempted
canada
now
more
than
months
later
oil
exports
have
continued
to
change
the
dynamics
of
the
global
oil
has
been
gaining
market
share
thanks
to
the
ongoing
agreement
between
opec
and
key
partners
like
russia
to
cut
production
by
million
the
spread
peaked
at
per
barrel
in
september
when
refinery
from
hurricane
harvey
glutted
the
market
and
helped
exports
spike
by
the
end
of
october
the
spread
has
been
falling
since
but
crude
exporters
are
highly
competitive
when
brent
has
a
crude
oil
production
has
more
than
doubled
to
million
record
weekly
output
per
eia
data
oil
demand
meanwhile
has
been
flat
in
the
to
million
range
for
a
decade
so
the
export
opportunity
has
been
allowed
to
open
as
output
has
the
tight
oil
that
has
been
the
basis
of
the
revolution
is
a
lighter
less
viscous
type
with
api
gravity
of
degrees
and
higher
yet
the
country
s
huge
million
capacity
refining
system
is
generally
configured
to
process
heavier
crudes
from
canada
mexico
and
venezuela
this
mismatch
helps
explain
why
the
has
been
exporting
large
volumes
of
crude
but
has
also
been
importing
it
taking
in
million
so
far
this
heavier
crude
types
can
actually
be
more
desirable
because
they
are
less
expensive
and
thus
refiners
capture
higher
margins
when
producing
products
from
these
grades
it
is
also
important
that
refineries
operate
all
their
units
as
close
to
capacity
as
possible
to
maximize
returns
and
pay
for
the
pricey
equipment
required
this
has
also
allowed
the
export
window
to
open
related
how
oil
trade
is
getting
an
efficiency
boostchina
the
world
largest
oil
consumer
has
ramped
up
imports
from
the
american
crude
shipments
to
china
went
from
nothing
prior
to
to
a
record
million
in
january
worth
billion
as
for
the
other
most
important
incremental
market
since
its
crude
oil
is
per
barrel
cheaper
than
the
imported
dubai
crude
inclusion
of
for
imports
is
a
very
good
move
for
india
notes
care
however
oil
products
constitute
about
percent
of
all
oil
exports
neighbor
mexico
has
been
taking
in
about
percent
of
gasoline
but
presidential
election
in
july
andrés
manuel
lópez
obrador
has
made
upgrading
the
country
s
refinery
system
a
top
priority
mexico
s
refining
capacity
has
stagnated
at
around
million
for
a
decade
despite
the
population
rising
by
nearly
percent
to
over
million
forward
although
exports
to
mexico
will
remain
high
simply
because
of
proximity
the
main
purpose
of
the
country
s
historic
energy
reforms
was
to
produce
more
energy
domestically
not
to
increase
reliance
on
the
mexico
extracting
crude
oil
sending
it
to
the
to
be
refined
and
then
importing
those
products
is
an
obvious
economic
drain
as
such
we
can
expect
that
an
increasing
number
of
countries
will
have
the
chance
to
shop
for
oil
