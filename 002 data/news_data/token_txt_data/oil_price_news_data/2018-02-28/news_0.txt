u.s. looks to dethrone russia as top oil producer
just
a
few
years
ago
hardly
anyone
expected
that
that
the
would
be
competing
with
the
world
s
top
oil
producers
for
the
number
thanks
to
the
shale
resurgence
here
we
the
past
few
weeks
american
crude
oil
production
outstripped
that
of
saudi
arabia
opec
s
de
facto
leader
and
biggest
the
is
on
track
to
dethrone
in
the
coming
months
the
world
s
current
leader
in
oil
production
the
second
shale
boom
came
in
the
wake
of
the
production
cut
deal
masterminded
and
led
by
opec
s
saudi
arabia
and
s
russia
as
opec
and
its
allies
have
been
withholding
a
total
of
million
bpd
production
over
the
past
year
oil
prices
have
increased
thanks
to
the
overhang
drawdown
on
the
back
of
restricted
supply
and
global
demand
growth
amid
robust
economic
growth
in
basically
all
regions
of
the
for
the
brief
hiccup
two
weeks
ago
wti
prices
have
held
above
a
barrel
since
the
start
of
and
shale
production
is
booming
and
on
course
to
crown
america
as
the
world
s
top
oil
producer
as
early
as
later
this
will
become
the
world
s
largest
crude
oil
producer
by
at
the
latest
fatih
birol
the
executive
director
of
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
this
week
the
will
overtake
russia
as
the
world
s
largest
oil
producer
definitely
next
year
if
not
as
early
as
this
year
he
the
united
states
will
become
the
oil
producer
sometime
very
soon
birol
told
reuters
reiterating
the
iea
s
estimate
from
its
latest
monthly
oil
market
report
published
earlier
in
us
crude
output
up
will
soon
overtake
saudi
arabia
and
could
catch
russia
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
iea
said
two
weeks
all
the
indicators
that
suggest
continued
fast
growth
in
the
us
are
in
perfect
alignment
rising
prices
leading
after
a
few
months
to
more
drilling
more
completions
more
production
and
more
hedging
the
iea
said
warning
that
the
surge
in
by
the
tip
the
oil
market
into
deeper
oversupply
should
opec
and
shale
collaborate
for
survival
forecasts
also
suggest
that
the
american
oil
production
will
beat
both
saudi
arabia
and
russia
this
year
assuming
that
the
deal
remains
intact
until
the
end
of
as
currently
energy
information
administration
eia
expects
in
its
latest
energy
outlook
that
production
will
average
million
bpd
this
year
this
is
higher
than
saudi
arabia
s
current
production
of
just
below
million
production
will
average
million
bpd
in
the
eia
said
earlier
this
month
this
is
higher
than
russia
s
current
production
of
just
below
million
bpd
as
moscow
is
cutting
production
as
part
of
the
far
in
february
crude
oil
production
has
topped
million
bpd
in
each
of
the
three
previous
weeks
eia
data
only
is
the
boosting
oil
production
but
it
is
also
increasing
its
oil
exports
including
to
the
prized
asian
market
on
which
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
been
competing
for
market
share
higher
oil
to
china
and
a
historic
first
to
the
middle
upending
the
global
oil
flows
and
eating
away
at
the
market
shares
of
saudi
arabia
and
opec
and
its
allies
seem
unfazed
by
shale
and
continue
to
send
messages
to
the
market
that
they
will
do
whatever
it
takes
to
balance
the
oil
inventories
and
that
production
cuts
are
here
to
stay
until
the
end
of
s
most
influential
minister
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
khalid
said
over
the
weekend
that
easing
of
the
production
cuts
would
start
sometime
in
but
we
don
t
know
when
and
we
don
t
know
how
said
confirming
that
he
wants
a
permanent
super
group
of
opec
and
producers
in
a
market
monitoring
fashion
that
allows
us
to
take
quick
opec
and
its
partners
are
set
to
review
the
deal
in
june
and
take
stock
of
the
pace
of
the
market
rebalancing
with
soaring
production
threatening
to
undo
a
large
part
of
their
cuts
the
cartel
and
allies
may
have
to
consider
if
the
time
has
come
for
them
to
start
defending
their
market
share
or
if
they
should
stick
to
the
cuts
in
the
name
of
higher
oil
prices
in
order
to
get
more
oil
revenues
in
budgets
and
boost
the
valuation
of
