this super basin is about to make an epic comeback
alaska
s
north
slope
is
a
super
basin
awaiting
a
resurgence
in
oil
production
according
to
a
new
report
over
the
next
eight
years
oil
production
could
rise
by
north
slope
has
been
a
significant
source
of
oil
and
gas
production
for
decades
even
though
output
has
been
in
decline
for
a
long
time
aging
fields
such
as
the
prudhoe
bay
field
run
by
bp
since
the
late
were
once
prolific
sources
of
production
but
have
been
gradually
losing
output
year
after
year
prudhoe
bay
can
claim
to
be
the
most
productive
oil
field
in
history
having
produced
billion
barrels
of
oil
as
of
last
year
but
it
also
peaked
in
the
and
has
been
losing
output
ever
since

but
the
decline
is
not
because
alaska
is
running
out
of
oil
output
fell
for
a
variety
of
reasons
including
high
costs
of
production
lack
of
infrastructure
federal
regulations
keeping
reserves
off
limits
boom
and
bust
price
cycles
among
other
factors
more
recently
the
downturn
in
prices
combined
with
skyrocketing
shale
production
made
risky
plays
like
alaska
not
worth
the
alaska
s
north
slope
may
still
have
a
lot
of
life
left
in
it
a
new
report
from
ihs
markit
concludes
that
the
north
slope
is
poised
to
as
a
major
source
of
energy
production
with
crude
oil
output
potentially
increasing
as
much
as
percent
during
the
next
eight
based
on
recent
discoveries
ihs
estimates
that
the
north
slope
basin
holds
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
boe
in
remaining
recoverable
resources
that
figure
includes
trillion
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas
and
billion
barrels
of
oil
ihs
says
that
the
estimated
ultimate
recovery
eur
of
the
north
slope
is
billion
boe
the
billion
boe
yet
to
be
produced
combined
with
the
billion
boe
that
has
already
been
extracted
those
numbers
are
worth
emphasizing
ihs
is
saying
that
there
is
twice
as
much
oil
yet
to
be
produced
than
all
of
the
oil
produced
from
the
north
slope
to
date
related
a
oil
war
could
break
up
opecthat
means
alaska
s
north
slope
is
not
a
dying
source
of
oil
output
far
from
it
ihs
calls
it
an
arrested
super
basin
rather
than
a
mature
ihs
defines
super
basin
as
a
basin
that
has
multiple
reservoirs
and
source
rocks
diverse
play
types
across
numerous
geologic
horizons
infrastructure
with
access
to
markets
and
established
service
sector
and
supply
chains
the
basin
must
also
have
at
least
billion
boe
in
conventional
remaining
reserves
and
have
already
had
produced
at
least
billion
previously
thought
of
as
a
mature
basin
recent
large
discoveries
made
in
the
shallow
nanushuk
and
torok
formations
indicate
this
basin
has
a
lot
of
room
left
to
grow
beyond
the
endicott
and
ivishak
formations
which
are
the
reservoirs
from
which
the
giant
prudhoe
bay
and
endicott
fields
produce

mohamed
associate
director
of
plays
and
basins
research
at
ihs
markit
and
lead
author
of
the
ihs
markit
analysis
this
is
why
we
refer
to
this
basin
as
being
in
the
because
it
still
has
such
significant
resources
to
that
doesn
t
mean
that
a
surge
in
output
is
inevitable
just
because
the
oil
is
there
doesn
t
mean
it
will
be
produced
sure
a
lot
of
formations
may
have
been
overlooked
until
now
but
many
of
the
obstacles
that
plagued
the
region
for
a
long
time
still
remain
the
north
slope
is
still
a
remote
and
expensive
place
to
drill
lacking
infrastructure
and
an
adequate
oilfield
services
sector
to
support
production
from
new
places
moreover
ihs
notes
that
uncertainty
over
state
tax
incentives
also
adds
risk
related
the
next
major
challenge
for
norway
s
oil
industryyet
some
of
the
hurdles
that
bedeviled
the
oil
industry
in
the
past
appear
to
be
surmountable
state
permitting
has
been
accelerated
and
drilling
technology
has
improved
cost
efficiencies
from
advances
in
drilling
and
operational
practices
will
require
the
right
kind
of
operator
expertise
mohamed
said
for
example
conocophillips
has
employed
learnings
from
its
unconventional
assets
to
lateral
drilling
in
their
alaska
north
slope
development
located
in
the
national
petroleum
the
oil
industry
may
be
able
to
apply
lessons
from
shale
drilling
in
the
to
alaska
just
a
few
years
ago
royal
dutch
shell
was
spending
billions
of
dollars
to
drill
offshore
in
the
chukchi
sea
hoping
to
use
its
engineering
prowess
to
open
up
new
frontiers
but
the
risks
operational
problems
cost
overruns
bad
press
and
ultimately
low
oil
prices
put
an
end
to
that
campaign
more
recent
shallow
water
discoveries
and
the
lessons
learned
from
the
shale
bonanza
have
made
onshore
formations
in
the
north
slope
appear
more
competitive
at
this
for
onshore
opportunities
in
a
stable
country
with
a
positive
investment
outlook
the
north
slope
provides
a
viable
alternative
to
the
competitive
unconventional
basins
where
acreage
prices
are
an
order
of
magnitude
greater
and
have
transportation
and
raw
material
constraints
even
if
they
are
temporary
