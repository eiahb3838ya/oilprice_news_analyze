u.s. oil data has markets confused
the
oil
market
continues
to
stagger
forward
without
direction
and
the
eia
data
is
offering
little
last
week
the
eia
reported
a
sharp
build
up
in
crude
oil
inventories
raising
concerns
about
over
supply
but
inventories
have
seesawed
back
and
forth
for
much
of
this
summer
muddying
the
waters
for
analysts
just
this
week
the
agency
reported
a
huge
drawdown
in
stocks
restoring
some
bullish
sentiment
and
helping
to
push
oil
prices
up
more
than
per
barrel
on
one
of
the
signs
of
a
bullish
market
in
our
view
is
that
prices
prove
resilient
to
highly
bearish
data
and
can
surge
on
moderate
improvements

the
oil
market
currently
fits
that
description
prices
recovered
from
last
week
s
extremely
bearish
data
and
have
risen
on
more
encouraging
signs
this
the
investment
bank
publishes
a
index
each
week
factoring
in
the
reams
of
data
that
come
out
of
the
eia
last
week
s
index
hit
or
the
weakest
result
in
week
the
index
jumped
to
not
bullish
by
any
means
but
a
sharp
improvement
from
last
crude
inventory
decline
of
million
barrels
is
the
first
thing
that
jumps
out
from
the
eia
report
the
drawdown
was
sharper
than
analysts
had
predicted
and
came
a
week
after
a
huge
week
s
jump
in
inventories
corresponded
with
a
flood
of
imports
similarly
the
sharp
inventory
decline
in
the
most
recent
data
is
largely
the
result
of
a
steep
drop
in
imports
at
a
time
when
refineries
continued
to
run
at
elevated
meant
that
lots
of
crude
oil
was
taken
out
of
inventory
and
processed
into
refined
products
it
s
no
surprise
then
that
gasoline
stocks
rose
and
the
build
was
which
pushed
gasoline
stocks
above
the
average
but
analysts
aren
t
concerned
that
this
is
a
bearish
signal
we
expect
the
refinery
maintenance
season
to
begin
soon
correcting

but
this
country
can

its
crudeoil
production

again
pushing

back
up

however
the
eia
s
new
practice
of
rounding
off
production
figures
to
the
nearest
bpd
makes
it
tricky
to
discern
production
trends
the

suggests
that
there
was
an
uptick
in
output
from
alaska
not
necessarily
from
shale
in
the
fact
problems
in
the
permian
are
likely
to
act
as
a
drag
on
growth
for
the
near
future
pipeline
bottlenecks
are
compounded
by
a
strain
on
services
equipment
and
labor
forcing
some
shale
drillers
to
pivot
away
from
west
texas
to
other
shale
basins
in
fact
data
from
s
p
global
platts
finds
that
the
permian
is
no
longer
the
most
profitable
shale
basin
in
the
country
permian
returns
have
fallen
below

even
the

the

frenzy
continues
but
the
profits
might
not
be
what
companies
a
lot
of
shale
companies
have
locked
themselves
into
hedges
anyway
much
of
this
year
s
hedged
production
was
secured
last
year
when
oil
prices
were
lower
so
even
if
the

this

in
fact
investors
are
groaning
on
news
that
shale
companies
are
boosting
spending
without
much
to
show
for
it
but
it
may
just
be
a
case
of
delayed
gratification
pipeline
bottlenecks
in
the
permian
are
leading
to
deferred
completions
a
massive
backlog
of
drilled
but
uncompleted
wells
ducs
continues
to
grow
particularly
in
west
texas
there
is
no
sense
in
bringing
that
output
online
only
to
sell
it
at
a
steep
discount
as
such
drillers
are
delaying
completion
even
as
they
continue
to
ramp
up
companies
such
as
pioneer
natural
resources
continue
to
add
rigs
to
the
permian
and
have
announced
spending
increases
but
the
production
that
stems
from
the
increase
in
activity
may
not
show
up
in
the
data
until
next
dynamic
has
global
implications
shale
continues
to
grow
but
it
is
likely
to
suffer
from
a
lull
in
growth
for
the
next
year
or
so
the
supply
story
then
is
arguably
a
bullish
one
at
least
for
the
next
months
or
so
shale
is
slowing
down
at
a
time
when
iran
s
supply
could
be
disrupted
venezuela
s
production
continues
to
fall
and
output
in
places
like
nigeria
and
libya
is
unstable
the
demand
side
of
the
equation
is
a
whole
different
story
to
be
sure
and
a
major
reason
why
oil
prices
have
declined
this
in
the
near
term
shale
might
end
up
being
a
bullish
factor
if
it
undershoots
