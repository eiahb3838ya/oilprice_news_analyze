the

discovery
confirms
the
potential
in
this
part
of
the
barents
sea
over
the
past
couple
of
years
we
have
learned
that
exploration
in
the
barents
sea
is
challenging
and
takes
patience
we
still
have
three
wells
and
one
well
left
to
drill
in
the
barents
sea
we
also
have
a
good
portfolio
for
the
next
couple
of
years
together
with
the
wells
we
drilled
in
this
will
help
clarify
the
potential
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
barents
sea
