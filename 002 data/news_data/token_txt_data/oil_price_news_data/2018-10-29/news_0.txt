iranâ€™s worst nightmare is coming true
in
what
must
seem
like
a
nightmare
scenario
for
iran
not
only
is
another
president
leveling
sanctions
against
its
economy
and
particularly
that
economy
s
lifeblood
its
oil
sector
but
the
current
president
has
admittedly
made
it
his
mission
to
drive
tehran
to
its
knees
over
what
he
sees
as
over
the
nuclear
accord
between
western
powers
and
recently
as
the
start
of
this
month
the
oil
markets
narrative
was
that
perhaps
president
donald
trump
had
pushed
a
bit
too
hard
by
reimposing
sanctions
against
iran
oil
markets
for
their
part
were
jittery
while
both
global
oil
benchmark
brent
and
benchmark
west
texas
intermediate
wti
futures
hit
highs
largely
on
supply
concerns
some
predicted
that
per
barrel
oil
by
the
end
of
the
year
was
imminent
while
tehran
maintained
a
defiant
tone
stating
that
neither
saudi
arabia
nor
opec
would
be
able
to
pump
enough
oil
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
estimated
between
bpd
and
million
what
a
different
just
a
few
weeks
can
make
oil
prices
are
now
trending
downward
falling
for
a
third
consecutive
week
as
global
stock
markets
tumbled
and
oil
markets
focused
on
a
weaker
demand
outlook
for
crude
going
forward
brent
crude
fell
percent
last
week
and
is
down
percent
from
its
october
high
of
wti
ended
the
week
down
some
percent
and
has
now
dropped
around
percent
from
its
recent
high
of
on
october
moreover
in
a
sign
of
things
to
come
and
money
managers
are
trimming
their
bets
that
crude
oil
prices
will
market
headwinds
perhaps
even
storm
clouds
are
brewing
over
a
slowdown
in
economic
growth
due
to
trade
war
tensions
between
washington
and
beijing
and
a
stronger
dollar
weighing
on
emerging
market
economies
with
those
countries
seeing
an
exodus
of
currency
for
higher
yielding
safer
havens
like
the
us
dollar
and
japanese
yen
a
stronger
dollar
also
increases
the
price
for
oil
import
dependent
countries
with
india
the
philippines
indonesia
and
others
particularly
can
gas
demand
keep
up
with
surging
production
tim
ghriskey
chief
investment
strategist
at
inverness
counsel
in
new
york
said
on
friday
that
we
ve
seen
oil
prices
sell
off
here
throughout
the
correction
we
ve
had
in
the
broad
market
the
concern
in
the
is
clearly
global
growth
and
that
s
immediately
reflected
in
oil
ubs
analysts
for
their
part
expect
oil
demand
to
grow
more
slowly
in
on
higher
oil
prices
and
weaker
economic
growth
barclays
currently
sees
the
oil
market
flipping
into
oversupply
in
the
first
quarter
of
next
scenario
for
iranhow
all
of
this
plays
out
remains
to
be
seen
but
with
a
general
downturn
in
economic
growth
and
a
slowdown
in
oil
growth
demand
going
forward
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
now
looks
easily
manageability
a
scenario
sure
to
cause
consternation
for
saudi
arabia
is
bracing
for
a
possible
return
of
oil
supply
overhang
a
recent
nightmarish
situation
for
riyadh
as
recently
as
and
when
it
was
forced
to
turn
to
russia
and
form
the
to
trim
oil

and
return
oecd
oil
inventories
to

while
giving
support
to
beleaguered

that
had
dipped
below
at
the
start
of
arabia
s
opec
governor
said
on
thursday
the
market
could
face
oversupply
in
the
current
quarter
and
after
a
slump
in
global
equities
clouded
the
outlook
for
demand
the
market
in
the
fourth
quarter
could
be
shifting
towards
an
oversupply
situation
as
evidenced
by
rising
inventories
over
the
past
few
weeks
adeeb

saudi
arabian

minister
khalid
said
there
could
be
a
need
for
intervention
to
reduce
oil
stockpiles
after
increases
in
recent
months
related
why
oil
prices
could
still
go
loweramid
these
developments
tehran
has
toned
down
then
eliminated
its
defiant
insistence
that
oil
markets
were
headed
for
trouble
with
the
loss
of
iranian
barrels
now
the
country
needs
a
new
narrative
moreover
the
fallout
for
iran
remains
clear
with
most
major
importers
of
iranian
crude
including
india
and
even
china
already
falling
into
compliance
with
sanctions
the
iranian
government
will
have
to
move
quickly
to
not
only
make
up
the
shortfall
in
oil
revenue
needed
for
state
coffers
but
to
also
appease
already
festering
public
angst
over
the
fall
of
the

currency

unemployment
and
ongoing
economic

since
