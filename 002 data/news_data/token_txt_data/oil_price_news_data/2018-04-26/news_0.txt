u.s. oil exports are only heading higher
oil
exports
just
hit
a
record
high
a
sign
that
the
shale
boom
will
continue
to
lead
to
higher
shipments
abroad
despite
some
infrastructure
week
the
averaged
million
barrels
per
day
in
crude
oil
exports
the
highest
average
for
any
week
on
surge
in
exports
is
being
driven
by
several
factors
the
most
obvious
is
the
rapid
growth
in
shale
production
with
shale
drillers
adding
new
supply
at
a
blistering
rate
record
production
is
leading
to
record
exports

but
also
all
of
the
oil
coming
out
of
the
permian
basin
is
light
and
sweet
and
refiners
on
the
gulf
coast
are
not
equipped
to
handle
volumes
of
this
type
of
oil
many
of
the
refiners
prefer
medium
and
heavier
grades
the
result
is
a
glut
of
light
sweet
oil
and
exporting
those
volumes
are
a
logical
reason
for
the
upward
trend
in
exports
is
the
renewed
price
differential
between
brent
and
wti
while
the
oil
market
is
global
the
two
benchmarks
reflect
some
unique
geographical
circumstances
wti
is
dragged
down
by
the
surging
shale
supply
while
brent
is
seeing
tighter
conditions
in
part
because
of
the
opec
production
cuts
but
also
because
of
strong
demand
in
much
of
the

few
months

brent
only
traded
at
a
premium
of
per
barrel
relative
to
wti
that
has
widened
sharply
to
more
than
per
barrel
in
the
last
week
cheaper
crude
from
the
makes
it
more
attractive
which
leads
to
higher

products
total

exports

record
high

the
week

on
april
eia
reported
a
surprise
uptick
in
crude
oil
and
gasoline
inventories
in
its
latest
report
which
weighed
on
market
sentiment
the
result
was
a
somewhat
mixed
bag
for
oil
prices
the
builds
in
crude
oil
and
gasoline
inventories
are
obviously
negative
but
soaring
crude
oil
and
gasoline
exports
cut
against
those

told
long
as
the
spread
remains
at
or
per
barrel
the
prospect
of
higher
exports
will
look
there
are
a
few
hurdles
blocking
much
higher
levels
of
exports
for
one
there
are
bottlenecks
in
the
permian
basin
that
could
prevent
increased
volumes
from
reaching
the
gulf
coast
the
discount
for
oil
in
midland
is
approaching
per
barrel
the
highest
in
years
that
is
the
result
of
the
shrinking
availability
of
space
on
the
region
s
pipelines
we
currently
see
only
of
spare
capacity
available
and
without
additional
pipes
coming
until
the
second
half
of
we
expect
basis
to
remain
an
issue
for
the
next
months

a

just
announced
that
it
had
received
enough
commitments
from
oil
producers
in
the
permian
to
move
ahead
with
the
construction
of
its
gray
oak
pipeline
which
would
move
oil
from
the
permian
to
corpus
christi
the
pipeline
would
have
a
capacity
of
bpd
and
eventually
but
it
won
t
come
online
until
the
end
of
the
spread
widening
to

is
significant
as
this
spread
implies
that
all
the
available
crude
pipeline
takeaway
was
filled
at
this
according
to
east
daley
capital
analysts
and
reported
on
by
natural
gas
reason
why
exports
might
eventually
cap
out
is
that
higher
shipments
will
put
pressure
on
the
differential
moving
product
out
of
the
will
drain
the
surplus
connected
to
the
wti
benchmark
while
adding
tons
of
new
supply
to
the
atlantic
basin
will
drag
down
brent
higher
oil
exports
could
edge
out
nigerian
supply
in
the
european
market
for
instance
ultimately
as
more
supplies
are
shipped
to
europe
or
elsewhere
brent
will
feel
the
effects
in
short
the
discount
will
narrow
again
closing
the
window
on
much
higher
levels
of
that
doesn
t
mean
that
oil
exports
are
set
to
fall
far
from
it
we
will
push
into
million
barrels

consistently
over
the
