where do oil markets go after the opec deal?
lately
oil
markets
have
been
finely
balanced
both
the
bulls
and
bears
can
make
a
compelling
argument
for
their
respective
cases
russia
has
vowed
not
to
flood
the
oil
markets
while
the
compliance
rates
remain
high
inventories
have
fallen
prices
touched
post
highs
at
a
barrel
brent
and
a
barrel
wti
bears
peddle
the
clich√©d
yet
not
at
all
insignificant
story
of
iea
in
its
recent
report
said
that
oil
production
could
reach
mbpd
this
year
rigs
are
being
added
across
the
country
taking
the
total
number
of
oil
rigs
to
its
highest
level
since
april
much
of
the
current
situation
is
thanks
to
the
vienna
deal
that
saved
oil
prices
after
they
tanked
below
might
ask
what
will
become
of
the
markets
after
the
deal
expires
in
other
words
how
long
can
the
producers
continue
to
cap
output
with
a
rising
production
and
the
possibility
that
one
day
and
that
day
might
come
very
soon
the
oil
producers
will
open
their
taps
anew
on
top
of
that
the
lack
of
any
drastic
upbeat
demand
figures
makes
a
bearish
case
for
oil
more
than
can
be
given
to
the
technological
improvements
and
resilience
of
shale
producers
that
kept
pumping
oil
even
when
prices
were
low
but
the
vienna
accord
spearheaded
and
held
together
by
saudi
arabia
and
russia
still
managed
to
raise
oil
prices
both
opec
and
russia
have
their
interests
in
maintaining
a
healthy
oil
price
for
every
one
dollar
oil
prices
fall
russia
loses
billion
in
revenue
opec
s
leader
saudi
arabia
needs
higher
oil
prices
to
ensure
the
successful
ipo
of
aramco
for
these
reasons
the
deal
was
extended
last
year
until
the
end
of
there
are
chances
it
might
be
extended
further
but
how
much
one
can
make
an
educated
guess
that
the
current
production
cuts
can
certainly
hold
until
aramco
s
ipo
which
is
a
huge
bet
on
the
country
s
future
once
the
ipo
is
done
we
might
expect
weakness
in
the
saudi
resolve
to
continue
the
deal
russian
executives
are
also
losing
year
in
november
many
energy
industry
executives
expressed
their
concern
regarding
rising
shale
production
it
remains
to
be
seen
for
how
long
they
can
allow
others
to
free
ride
on
their
efforts
the
iea
reported
that
the
will
be
a
net
exporter
of
oil
and
gas
by
revising
its
estimates
it
said
that
production
will
touch
mbpd
this
year
earlier
estimates
suggested
this
wouldn
t
happen
until
analysts
expect
oil
prices
to
rise
this
yearother
opec
members
are
also
gearing
up
to
produce
again
after
signs
of
tightening
oil
markets
countries
like
kuwait
uae
and
iraq
have
expressed
their
ambitions
to
increase
production
once
the
deal
expires
kuwait
s
oil
minister
said
that
the
country
will
raise
its
production
from
mbpd
to
mbpd
by
end
of
march
iraq
aims
to
edge
up
production
to
mbpd
from
mbpd
by
year
s
end
and
iran
says
it
might
add
bpd
after
the
deal
expires
we
can
be
certain
that
russians
will
increase
production
as
members
meet
in
june
for
a
review
meeting
inventory
levels
are
still
above
the
moving
average
showing
that
they
have
work
to
do
but
some
members
may
be
tempted
for
an

international
oil
economist
and
world
bank
consultant
on

is
positive
about
oil
prices
he
says
oil
market
fundamentals
are
positive
enough
to
sustain
an
oil
price
ranging

the

projected

year
over
dr
salameh
was
very
upbeat
when
discussing
the
strength
of
the
commitment
between
russia
and
saudi
arabia
saying
that
opec
and
russia
have
suffered
a
great
ordeal
with
the
steep
decline
of
oil
prices
since
that
is
why
they
never
want
to
suffer
that
experience
to
rely
on
a
single
deal
that
limits
production
from
certain
members
is
not
a
good
idea
not
to
mention
the
fact
that
the
production
cuts
continue
to
face
challenges
in
the
shape
of
rising
production
offsetting
the
effects
there
is
only
one
way
to
get
out
of
this
vicious
circle
of
supply
and
price

a
marriage
between
opec

uplifted
the
sentiments
again
however
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
russia
will
go
along
with
this
plan
even
if
it

the
fact
remains
that
such

can
not

production
cuts
are
not
