home
to
one
of
the
world
largest
crude
storage
facilities
with
a
current
capacity
of
million
barrels
although
more
is
coming
online
later
in
the

an
article
published
last
september
said
that
various
trading
houses
were
selling
crude
from
the
storage
hub
after
the
market
had
flipped
into
backwardation

prices
are

this

the

that
was
almost

the

of

off

appear
greatly
exaggerated

it
