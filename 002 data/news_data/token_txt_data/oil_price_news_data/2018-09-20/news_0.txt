iran: we wonâ€™t let opec boost production
it
s
about
that
time
again
wti
hits
per
barrel
and
the
is
protect
the
countries
of
the
middle
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
very
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continue
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
prices
we
will
remember
the
opec
monopoly
must
get
prices
down
now
opec
does
have
a
meeting
in
the
coming
days
in
algiers
to
assess
the
state
of
the
oil
market
and
decide
on
next
steps
but
one
of
the
largest
challenges
for
opec
is
balancing
the
oil
market
in
the
wake
of
lost
barrels
from
iran
a
key
factor
driving
up
prices
and
also
a
fact
that
seems
to
be
lost
on
the
american
are
no
clear
solutions
for
that
leave
the
oil
market
satisfied
while
also
maintaining
group
obvious
course
of
action
is
to
allow
for
higher
production
levels
but
there
is
no
way
to
do
this
while
also
getting
all
parties
on
board
iran
s
oil
minister
said
that
any
change
to
tehran
s
allotment
would
be
blocked
i
will
definitely
veto
any
decision
that
threatens
our
national
interest
bijan
zanganeh
said
in
an
interview
with
reporters
from
s
p
global
platts
and
bloomberg
news
anyone
who
says
they
will
compensate
for
the
shortfall
in
the
market
is
speaking
against
iran
this
is
a
political
statement
not
because
any
opec
agreement
requires
unanimous
consent
iran
could
block
any
changes
to
the
formal
oil
production
cut
still
holds
a
little
bit
of
leverage
because
the
specifics
of
the
june
agreement
which
called
for
increased
production
on
the
order
of
million
barrels
per
day
were
not
hammered
out
in
all
likelihood
saudi
arabia
and
russia
would
realistically
take
on
a
greater
share
of
output
mostly
because
they
are
the
only
ones
that
have
the
ability
to
choose
to
produce
substantially
formalizing
those
increases
is
politically
tricky
after
all
iran
is
taking
tangible
losses
because
of
sanctions
those
missing
barrels
have
to
be
made
up
elsewhere
saudi
arabia
russia
and
a
few
gulf
states
are
the
only
countries
that
can
increase
output
on
a
large
scale
but
even
if
riyadh
can
physically
replace
the
gap
left
over
by
iran
iran
would
never
vote
in
favor
of
such
a
scenario
no
consensus
on
this
issue
is
likely
commerzbank
wrote
in
a
a
de
facto
increase
in
saudi
production
in
lieu
of
supply
losses
from
iran
is
the
only
realistic
outcome
the
end
result
could
be
no
formal
agreement
on
specific
allotments
that
take
into
account
falling
production
from
iran
and
venezuela
but
the
shift
in
market
share
may
happen
anyway

or
not

amounts

a

riyadh
and
moscow
the
two
largest
producers
within
the
group
but
it
certainly
will
diminish
group
cohesion
they
are
sacrificing
opec
they
are
destroying
opec
and
slowly
slowly
without
directly
saying
so
they
want
to
gather
some
names
together
to
create
a

to
replace
opec
and
manage
the
market
zanganeh
also
said
that
saudi
officials
should
fess
up
to
their
real
motivations
if
they
want
to
produce
excessively
we
can
not
stop
them
zanganeh
said
there
is
no
forcible
instrument
in
opec
but
they
should
do
it
in
the
name
of
opec
they
should
come
out
and
say
has
phoned
and
told
me
to
increase
output
and
i
have
no
other
way
but
to
do
so
not
only
are
saudi
arabia
and
russia
taking
on
a
greater
role
in
the
current
moment
to
ensure
market
stability
but
they
are
also
looking

institutionalize

seems
to
be
counting
on
saudi
arabia
and

along
with

shale
drillers
to
offset
the
losses
from
iran
saudi
arabia
has
added
about
bpd
since
may
while
russia
has
added
about
bpd
but
covering
the
accelerating
losses
from
iran
won
t
be
an
easy
task
iran
could
lose
as
much
as
by
the
end
of
the
year
according
to

p
global
platts
analytics
venezuela
could
lose
another
arabia
is
the
only
country
with
the
ability
to
increase
production
on
the
scale
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here
but
any
ramp
up
in
production
necessarily
cuts
into
spare
capacity
which
is
already
at
relatively
low
levels
the
oil
market
will
welcome
more
barrels
from
saudi
arabia
but
oil
traders
will
nonetheless
grow
jittery
as
spare
capacity
from
earlier
this
week
that
riyadh
was
content
letting
oil
prices
rise
above
per
barrel
are
perhaps
a
sign
that
saudi
officials
are
acknowledging
the
challenge
of
keeping
a
lid
on
prices
at
a
time
when
iran
is
seeing
significant
disruptions
as
a
result
it
won
t
be
surprising
if
saudi
arabia
increases
output
in
the
months
ahead
but
that
the
effort
fails
to
prevent
oil
from
moving
