of
next
year
the
uae
s
energy
minister
suhail
said
according
to
agreement
will
be
officially
signed
in
march
in
saudi
arabia
the
oil
minister
said
and
will
seek
to
align
opec
with
oil
producers
most
importantly
russia
on
matters
likely
to
include
achieving
market
production
quotas
the
term
market
balance
is
the
new
phrase
opec
is
using
instead
of
referencing
specific
oil
prices
after
opec
in
october
steered
its
members
away
from
any
words
that
may
put
it
at
odds
with
proposed
legislation
called
the
nopec
and
a
group
of
members
reached
an
agreement
on
friday
to
cut
production
starting
in
january
opec
s
portion
of
the
production
cuts
was
bpd
with
saudi
arabia
s
accounting
for
bpd
of
that
the
countries
agreed
to
bpd
of
the
production
cut
with
russia
accounting
for
approximately
bpd
of
the
for
its
part
said
it
would
take
months
for
that
level
of
cut
to
be
achieved
likewise
opec
s
production
cuts
are
unlikely
to
shrink
by
bpd
immediately
on
january
and
will
more
than
likely
take
months
as
prices
ticked
upward
on
friday
but
failed
to
stay
up
on
monday
even
as
opec
member
libya
exempt
from
the
most
recent
production
cut
deal
declared
a
force
majeure
on
monday
as
protests
hit
the
nation
s
beleaguered
oil
industry
shutting
in
production
of
its
biggest
oilfield
idea
of
making
an
alliance
official
has
been
bandied
about
for
some
time
most
recently
by
khalid
who
said
in
late
october
that
he
hoped
to
set
up
an
official
governing
body
to
preside
over
oil
market
want
to
sign
a
new
cooperation
agreement
that
is
that

not
expire
after
or
we
will
leave
it
open
