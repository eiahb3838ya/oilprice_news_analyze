the dangers of chinaâ€™s growing oil demand
china
s
oil
thirst
continues
to
grow
despite
the
impact
that
tariffs
are
starting
to
have
on
the
world
s
second
largest
economy
on
saturday
preliminary
data
from
china
s
general
administration
of
customs
showed
that
china
s
crude
oil
imports
rose
percent
to
record
high
of
million
in
november
a
report
by
commodities
data
provider
s
p
global
platts
said
it
was
the
first
time
china
monthly
crude
imports
have
totaled
more
than
million
the
previous
record
high
was
million
reached
in
april
on
a
barrels
basis
the
report
added
the
inflow
represents
a
percent
increase
from
million
in
put
that
number
into
perspective
china
million
bpd
of
oil
imports
is
just
slightly
under
saudi
arabia
s
record
high
oil
production
of
million
in
november
just
before
opec
and
its
allies
started
the
production
cut
deal
in
january
if
beijing
and
washington
can
t
agree
on
a
trade
deal
within
the
time
frame
set
last
week
after
president
trump
met
chinese
president
xi
jinping
at
the
summit
in
argentina
economic
slowdown
in
china
especially
in
manufacturing
will
ensue
causing
a
drop
in
chinese
oil
demand
and
by
extension
global
oil
kong
bp
s
chief
executive
of
oil
trading
operations
in
asia
told
reuters
in
late
september
that
ongoing
trade
tensions
between
china
and
the
could
slowly
hit
oil
demand
in
the
country
going
into
i
worry
about
the
impact
of
the
trade
war
manifesting
itself
slowly
she
said
the
trade
war
impact
has
not
really
shown
up
in
the
data
anywhere
but
it
will
show
up
gradually
over
time
so
the
supply
shock
is
very
sharp
and
prompt
while
the
impact
from
trade
war
is
boiling
over
glimmer
of
hopenow
that
there
is
at
least
a
glimmer
of
hope
that
trade
tensions
can
be
remedied
and
a
deal
reached
that
will
prevent
the
from
hiking
existing
tariffs
on
billion
worth
of
chinese
goods
from
percent
to
percent
oil
demand
could
remain
robust
while
the
country
ramps
up
procurement
of
both
american
oil
imports
and
lng
related
succeeds
what
s
next
for
oil
the
brief
respite
in
the
trade
war
between
the
two
sides
has
already
allowed
a
window
for
chinese
oil
companies
to
start
importing
oil
again
sources
familiar
with
knowledge
of
the
matter
said
last
week
that
chinese
oil
trader
unipec
will
start
to
buy
oil
in
march
when
the
period
reached
between
trump
and
xi
chinese
buyers
who
want
to
buy
crude
will
rush
to
import
the
oil
during
this
window
a
senior
executive
from
asia
s
largest
refiner
sinopec
said
according
to
a
cnbc
report
adding
that
the
oil
has
to
arrive
in
china
before
march
oil
prices
are
low
so
it
makes
economic
sense
to
store
some
crude
as
commercial
inventories
said
the
executive
who
asked
not
to
be
scenariogoing
forward
a
scenario
for
not
only
china
but
for
global
markets
particularly
emerging
markets
would
be
no
formal
deal
reached
by
march
a
likely
possibility
given
trump
s
hard
line
over
china
s
trade
imbalance
with
the
as
well
as
beijing
s
inability
to
concede
in
key
areas
that
negotiators
demand
numerous
demands
are
almost
impossible
for
china
to
agree
too
at
least
in
the
short
term
since
it
would
force
the
country
to
reconfigure
how
it
trades
and
even
how
it
implements
government
financial
and
economic
policy
likewise
too
much
acquiescence
by
xi
jinping
would
weaken
his
status
in
the
eyes
of
the
chinese
populace
just
as
he
continues
to
build
his
leadership
and
power
to
levels
not
seen
since
the
reign
of
mao
