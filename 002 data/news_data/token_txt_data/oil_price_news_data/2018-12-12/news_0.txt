why the opec+ deal wonâ€™t cut it
now
nearly
a
week
removed
from
the
agreement
confidence
in
the
efficacy
of
the
deal
is
becoming
after
announced
cuts
of
million
barrels
per
day
a
flurry
of
reports
from
oil
analysts
and
investment
banks
congratulated
the
group
on
a
job
well
done
after
all
the
figure
was
larger
than
the
market
had
reality
is
beginning
to
set
in
first
the
cuts
might
not
be
realized
in
january
despite
the
promise
russia
indicated
that
it
was
going
to
slow
walk
the
cuts
phasing
in
an
initial
to
bpd
in
reductions
in
january
this
is
significant
because
russia
is
the
main
actor
in
the
cohort
the
group
is
expected
to
slash
output
by
bpd
but
if
russia
is
only
going
to
do
its
part
gradually
over
the
next
few
months
the
cuts
might
not
reach
the
promised
levels
anytime
soon
moreover
because
there
are
no
allotments
it
will
be
hard
to
hold
any
producer
undermines
confidence
in
the
deal
compared
to
early
last
week
the
outcome
was
rather
disappointing
the
whole
process
wasn
t
convincing
and
it
s
still
uncertain
whether
they
will
actually
cut

that
the
