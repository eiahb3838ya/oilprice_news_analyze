crude
oil
prices
remained
steady
today
after
the
energy
information
administration
confirmed
an
api
estimate
of
a
crude
oil
inventory
draw
but
a
much
smaller
one
than
api
s
million
barrels
the
authority
reported
crude
oil
inventories
in
the
united
states
had
gone
down
by
million
barrels
in
the
week
to
december
the
second
weekly
draw
after
a
string
of
weekly
increases
after
a
draw
of
million
barrels
a
week
prices
have
proved
stubborn
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
moving
up
and
down
by
too
little
for
the
comfort
of
those
who
would
like
to
see
them
higher
in
light
of
some
strong
tailwinds
such
as
opec
s
agreement
to
cut
production
and
a
major
field
outage
in
it
seems
the
relentless
increase
in
production
is
countering
these
tailwinds
daily
output
is
likely
to
have
continued
rising
last
week
but
the
actual
numbers
will
become
public
at
a
later
time
when
the
eia
processes

to
be
beginning
to

russia
said
it
will
reduce
its
production
slowly
and
gradually
justifying
the
decision
with

means
the

in

will
not
be
felt
