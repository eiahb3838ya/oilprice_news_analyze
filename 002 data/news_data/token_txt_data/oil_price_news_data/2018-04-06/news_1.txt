has the world started to kick its oil addiction?
until
a
decade
ago
most
of
the
world
was
a
captive
customer
of
would
pay
any
price
for
gasoline
and
oil
demand
was
soaring
regardless
of
the
surging
oil
recently
many
countries
around
the
world
have
started
to
show
more
sensitivity
to
oil
demand
grows
as
their
economies
grow
but
oil
demand
is
also
more
susceptible
to
oil
price
swings
with
the
oil
correlation
behaving
more
like
an
everyday
product
according
to

liam
it
s
at
least
a
decade
or
more
too
early
to
call
the
end
of
the
world
s
oil
addiction
the
research
and
data
suggest
that
in
a
growing
number
of
large
economies
oil
demand
now
correlates
negatively
with
oil
prices
in
other
words
consumption
drops
when
prices
rise
and
vice
common
economic
concept
applicable
to
almost
every
other
product
on
the

this
has
not
always
been

analyzed
data
for
three
periods
ending
in
and
the
first
period
until
countries
comprising
of
oil
demand
including
the
united
states
india
china
and
russia
showed
a
positive
correlation
between
oil
demand
and
their
gross
domestic
product
gdp
and
between
demand
and
oil
prices
in
the
decade
before
the
financial
crisis
in
oil
demand
soared
almost
everywhere
in
the
world
despite
the
fact
that
oil
prices
were
also
rallying
this
was
the
period
of
chinese
industrialization
and
construction
boom
which
gobbled
up
oil
at
any
price
in
most
of
the
world
the
picture
was
the
demand
rose
together
with
rising
economies
and
with
rising
oil
prices
suggesting
that
those
countries
were
captive
customers
of
oil

second

in
the
research
coincides
with
the
financial
crisis
and
the
recession
that
followed
during
the
years
through

from
american

and
started
to
react
to
the
resurgence

began

in
that
period
the
shifted
away
from
being
a
captive
customer
of
oil
to
look
more
like
germany
or
japan
where
the
link
between
gdp
and
oil
consumption
has
weakened
while
this
was
a
profound
shift
in
how
oil

india
and
still
looked
like
captive
customers
of

their
oil
demand
was
soaring
even
in
periods
of
oil
price
spikes
the
research
and
data
in
the
third
ten
years
through
oil
demand
in
china
and
india
looked
like
more
responsive
to
the
prevailing
oil
prices
in
those
countries
and
other
developing
economies
oil
demand
growth
is
still
closely
connected
with
the
gdp
growth
but
oil
demand
has
started
to
show
some
negative
correlation
with
oil
prices
suggesting
that
consumption
is
more
susceptible
to
the
price
of
oil
than
it
was
in
the
previous
decades
true
the
period
until
includes
the
oil
price
crash
during
which
the
negative
correlation
was
heightened
by
the
fact
that
demand
grew
faster
because
of
the
low
oil
prices

india
and
china
have
now
moved
into
the
group
of
economies
that
show
positive
correlation
between
oil
demand
and
economic
growth
and
a
negative
correlation
between
demand
and
oil
prices
the
united
states
is
also
in
this
group
with
a
weak
positive
correlation
between
demand
and
gdp
and
with
a
negative
price
correlation
the
research
s
not
clear
whether
the
global
economies
will
continue
to
show
a
negative
correlation
between
oil
demand
and
oil
prices
from
this
point
onwards
but
the
research
suggests
that
in
the
united
states
and
even
in
china
and
india
oil
demand
is
now
more
sensitive
to
oil
prices
than
it
was
a
decade
or
two
ago
and
that
oil
producers
may
be
wrong
to
think
that
they
still
hold
captive
customers
who
would

product
