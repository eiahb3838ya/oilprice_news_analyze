permian bottleneck could impact global oil markets
the
permian
basin
is
driving
shale
growth
with
expectations
that
the
basin
will
add
enormous
volumes
this
year
keeping
the
oil
market
but
the
permian
s
pipeline
network
is
already
filling
up
forcing
steep
discounts
for
oil
and
threatening
to
derail
the
aggressive
growth
projections
for
the
eia
predicts
the
permian
will
hit
million
barrels
per
day
of
output
in
april
an
increase
of
bpd
from
march
and
up
a
shocking
bpd
from
a
year
ago
shale
e
ps
and
the
oil
majors
are
pouring
in
billions
of
dollars
into
the
region
and
two
out
of
every
three
rigs
the
industry
is
adding
is
going
into
the
the
shale
basin
is
getting
crowded
which
not
only
means
skyrocketing
prices
for
land
and
a
search
for
opportunities
along
the
periphery
but
also
rapidly
shrinking
availability
on
the
permian
s
pipeline
network
as
these
fringe
areas
begin
to
get
exploited
we
are
seeing
more
and
more
crude
that
needs
to
find
a
pipeline
to
cushing
or
the
gulf
coast
john
zanner
energy
analyst
for
rbn
energy
told
market
analysts
knew
that
new
pipeline
capacity
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
move
all
of
the
oil
out
of
the
permian
but
few
expected
the
region
to
run
out
of
pipeline
space
so
at
the
end
of
there
was
just
of
line
space
available
out
of
western
texas
this
small
surplus
is
likely
to
turn
into
a
deficit
in
the
second
half
of
the
iea
wrote
in
its
march
oil
market
report
the
pipeline
gap
could
widen
further
until
in
turn
reducing
the
price
of
wti
midland
relative
to
related
oil
prices
poised
to
rise
as
cycle
comes
to
an
end
other
bottlenecks
such
as
shortages
of
sand
and
labour
as
well
as
mounting
demands
for
investor
returns
could
also
slow
growth
but
most
likely
beyond
for
now
us
producers
continue
to
ramp
up
activity
the
iea
wrote
in
its
march
oil
market
iea
was
spot
on
except
that
the
bottleneck
the
agency
predicted
is
already
starting
to
materialize
even
late
last
month
when
the
iea
warned
about
pipeline
issues
the
thinking
was
that
bottlenecks
would
start
to
form
in
according
to
genscape
and
reported
on
by
reuters
pipeline
utilization
in
the
permian
has
jumped
to
percent
over
the
past
month
genscape
says
the
permian
has
of
pipeline
rail
and
local
refining
capacity
combined
that
s
a
problem
given
that
the
eia
sees
production
jumping
to
in
essentially
means
the
pipelines
are
already
close
to
being
completely
full
and
the
prices
for
oil
from
the
permian
are
starting
to
reflect
that
problem
canadian
oil
producers
have
been
suffering
from
painful
discounts
for
their
oil
because
of
a
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
but
now
the
permian
is
running
into
a
similar
problem
on
wednesday
midland
light
sweet
crude
traded
at
a
discount
relative
to
what
the
spreads
are
telling
you
is
that
these
pipelines
are
full
going
to
the
gulf
coast
kendrick
rhea
at
energy
consultancy
east
daley
capital
told
reuters
the
earliest
possible
relief
will
come
from
the
permian
express
pipeline
which
could
add
bpd
of
capacity
by
the
end
of
this
is
a
serious
problem
for
permian
drillers
who
could
be
forced
to
slow
growth
or
even
shut
down
some
operations
if
things
get
worse
that
could
have
a
significant
impact
on
are
we
sleepwalking
into
the
next
oil
crisis
but
there
are
broader
ramifications
for
the
global
oil
market
the
assumption
that
the
oil
market
would
be
not
only
this
year
but
for
years
to
come
is
largely
predicated
on
aggressive
growth
from
shale
generally
but
also
the
permian
in
particular
if
permian
growth
comes
to
a
standstill
this
year
that
will
completely
upend
conventional
wisdom
about
adequate
two
opposing
forces
in
the
americas
dominate
our
medium
term
forecast
in
the
early
years
us
supply
far
outweighs
collapsing
venezuelan
capacity
keeping
the
world
adequately
supplied
the
iea
wrote
in
its
oil
report
the
agency
expects
the
to
add
over
the
next
five
iea
warned
about
a
supply
problem
in
the
but
if
the
permian
does
not
add
the
enormous
volumes
that
everybody
thinks
it
will
the
supply
problems
could
arrive
sooner
than
expected
to
be
sure
a
series
of
pipeline
projects
could
resolve
the
bottleneck
but
several
of
them
are
not
expected
to
come
online
