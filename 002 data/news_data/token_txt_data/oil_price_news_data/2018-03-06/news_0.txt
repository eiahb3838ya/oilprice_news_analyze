shale pioneer issues warning to u.s. drillers
shale
has
effectively
upended
the
oil
industry
with
predictions
that
total
oil
production
will
surpass
saudi
arabia
s
output
this
year
in
turn
rivalling
russia
s
to
become
the
preeminent
global
producer
from
its
position
of
being
dependent
on
and
subordinate
to
opec
the
has
seemingly
become
the
big
bad
wolf
through
a
catalogue
of
tactical
errors
and
misplaced
belief
in
its
own
muscle
the
mighty
brick
edifice
of
opec
has
begun
to
look
more
like
a
bundle
of
international
energy
agency
iea
forecasts
that
the
will
become
a
net
energy
exporter
by
the
late
but
how
accurate
is
that
forecast
and
to
what
extent
is
it
mere
hyperbole
in
october
last
year
there
were
already
caveats
about
the
nature
of
shale
with
some
warning
that
aggressive
expansion
was
leading
to
rapid
initial
growth
that
would
ultimately
peak
too
soon
mark
papa
former
head
of
eog
resources
nyse
eog
raised
the
question
of
flatlining
output
in
the
face
of
the
doubling
of
the
oil
rig
count
h
ow
can
a
rig
count
be
double
and
yet
production
be
stagnant
figures
have
also
been
influenced
by
the
rapid
pace
of
technological
development
a
pace
which
has
itself
plateaued
robert
clarke
woodmac
research
director
for
lower
upstream
said
that
i
f
future
wells
are
not
offset
by
continued
technology
evolution
the
permian
may
peak
in
iea
forecasts
then
may
be
based
on
rapid
growth
and
technological
development
that
simply
isn
t
sustainable
related
shell

competition
in
the
gulf
of
mexicois
shale
just
a
sheep
in
wolf
s
clothing
its
bite
ultimately
as
benign
as
grandma
the
iea
is
still
forecasting
that
the
will
be
the
number
one
oil
exporter
by
at
million
bpd
but
at
the
ceraweek
conference
in
houston
on
tuesday
papa
is
set
to
turn
that
thinking
on
its
head
when
he
warns
the
industry
that
shale
will
hit
roadblocks
that
prevent
such
forecasts
from
being
realized
he
says
the
best
drilling
locations
in
north
dakota
and
south
texas
are
already
tapped
out
the
oil
market
is
in
a
state
of
misdirection
now
papa
told
the
wsj
someone
needs
to
speak
how
much
of
this
is
indeed
misdirection
on
his
part
papa
is
ceo
at
centennial
resource
development
nasdaq
cdev
which
holds
the
rights
to
acres
in
the
delaware
of
the
permian
a
slowdown
in
expansion
and
its
potential
consequence
of
increased
oil
prices
is
advantageous
to
centennial
s
shareholders
so
who
are
we
to
believe
guilty
of
misdirection
a
more
conservative
rate
of
growth
may
simply
be
desired
by
some
but
it
also
may
be
an
inevitability
kevin
holt
chief
investment
officer
of
invesco
value
equities
has
said
that
the
situation
many
companies
find
themselves
in
is
in
part
a
consequence
of
the
link
between
their
leaders
pay
and
production
growth
rather
than
returns
on
investment
this
has
fostered
a
drilling
frenzy
that
has
resulted
in
an
explosion
of
production
an
unregulated
drilling
frenzy
that
may
be
at
odds
with
the
long
term
survival
of
those
companies
investors
have
subsequently
demanded
a
more
conservative
approach
to
drilling
which
appears
to
be
having
a
stabilizing
effect

nigeria
can
produce
oil
at
a
barrelultimately
the
market
is
subject
to
myriad
pressures
such
as
the
heterogeneous
quality
of
oil
fluctuations
in
labor
costs
and
oil
prices
as
well
as
changes
in
the
pace
of
technological
development
these
pressures
shape
the
nature
of
the
market
and
also
make
it
difficult
to
predict
the
longevity
of
tight
oil
reserves
and
the
ability
of
companies
to
exploit
them
another
significant
factor
is

the

shadow
of

how
long
until
it
begins
to
bare
its
own
teeth
is
papa
s
anticipated
warning
about
to
shake
up
the
industry
or
is
it
merely
the
continuation
of
the
chorus
of
restraint
that
many
in
the
industry
have
been
voicing
in
this
period
of
massive
growth
and
upheaval
ultimately
the
industry
will
decide
whether
it
will
be
eating
out
of
papa
s
hand
or
persist
in
biting
the
hand
