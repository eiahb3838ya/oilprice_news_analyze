the u.s. oil industry sets its sights on asia
just
a
decade
ago
few
could
have
imagined
that
the
would
be
producing
more
than
million
bpd
of
crude
but
with
the
explosion
of
shale
production
that
is
exactly
where
we
what
can
only
be
seen
as
a
complete
in
policy
and
mindset
the
flow
of
imported
oil
is
poised
to
become
the
flow
of
exports
this
about
turn
must
of
course
be
borne
out
by
logistics
and
practicalities
first
as
aging
infrastructure
that
was
designed
primarily
with
movement
in
mind
requires
a
significant
overhaul
if
it
to
meet
this
reverse
consequences
of
this
shift
are
already
being
revealed
as
trading
volumes
in
wti
futures
surged
ahead
of
those
of
brent
and
trading
of
oil
future
contracts
has
doubled
in
the
last
decade
what
formerly
acted
more
as
an
indicator
of
inventories
is
now
being
seen
as
a
benchmark
for
traders
and
shippers
and
the
spread
between
wti
and
brent
is
this
rate
of
production
increase
the
is
set
to
overtake
russian
crude
output
in
late
making
it
the
foremost
global
supplier
at
per
barrel
drilling
companies
can
afford
to
develop
their
equipment
and
techniques
while
at
the
same
time
keeping
shareholders
how
long
it
can
last
is
open
to
debate
but
with
the
stagnant
output
of
north
sea
oil
seemingly
unable
to
meet
the
rising
demand
in
developing
markets
such
as
asia
the
boom
of
oil
production
shows
no
sign
of
than
being
crippled
by
opec
attempt
to
flood
the
market
north
american
shale
seems
to
have
taken
this
challenge
in
stride
and
even
become
stronger
faster
and
more
efficient
as
a
result
couple
this
with
crude
s
more
dynamic
pricing
system
and
it
is
hard
to
see
why
wti
futures
are
overtaking
futures
like
brent

frac
sand
shortage
threatens

boomthe
gap
in
production
that
opec
is
attempting
to
create
is
simply
being
filled
by
shale
so
it
seems
that
not
only
did
opec
shoot
itself
in
the
foot
by
forcing
the
price
to
per
barrel
it
is
compounding
that
mistake
by
allowing

flood
the
market
arabia
remains
unconcerned
and
the
lacks
the
infrastructure
to
deliver
anything
near
the
volume
that
it
does
to
china
but
the
very
fact
that
it
is
shipping
any
oil
at
all
amply
demonstrates
the
s
position
in
the
global
oil
longer
a
slave
to
the
market
according
to
opec
the
finds
itself
in
the
enviable
position
of
being
in
control
of
its
own
oil
supply
when
oil
prices
are
high
it
can
ramp
up
production
thereby
both
saving
money
on
expensive
imports
and
capitalizing
on
high
exports
should
prices
fall
again
it
can
take
advantage
of
low
import
costs
and
scale
back
production
until
it
reaches
a
favorable
this
means
for
opec
is
that
its
power
is
a
mere
shadow
of
what
it
was
in
the
its
influence
of
the
global
oil
trade
is
evaporating
and
its
reliance
on
oil
wealth
is
something
that
is
looking
untenable
at
best
the
rising
dominance
of
russia
and
the
coupled
with
the
global
shift
away
from
oil
consumption
means
that
it
must
diversify
its
income
if
it
wants
to
survive
the
aramco
ipo
may
just
be
the
very
beginning
of
that
crude
exports
hit
a
major
milestonewhat
we
re
seeing
is
more
than
just
the
reversal
from
energy
dependence
to
energy
dominance
but
a
complete
transformation
of
the
global
elastic
production
diverse
crude
quality
vast
storage
ability
integrated
trading
capabilities
and
concentrated
refining
capacity
that
has
come
about
from
the
boom
in
shale
oil
output
all
amount
to
energy
independence
but
crucially
they
mean
that
