saudis ready to swing oil market into deficit
saudi
arabia
is
undergoing
a
truly
seismic
shift
in
its
economy
politics
and
society
all
thanks
to
the
oil
price
crash
of
crown
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
commonly
referred
to
as
mbs
would
likely
not
have
had
the
opportunity
to
initiate
the
sweeping
changes
envisaged
in
vision
had
it
not
been
for
the
price
collapse
now
riyadh
needs
oil
prices
to
rise
as
high
as
possible
for
the
plan
to
succeed
and
is
even
ready
to
tip
the
market
into
a
deficit
to
that
arabia
used
to
be
opec
s
most
influential
price
dove
according
to
bloomberg
s
grant
smith
now
the
kingdom
has
adopted
a
markedly
different
approach
saudi
arabia
is
now
focused
on
pushing
prices
as
high
as
it
can
for
a
very
simple
reason
aramco
s
are
more
than
enough
doubts
surrounding
the
listing
of
the
world
s
largest
oil
company
there
s
no
certainty
about
the
location
of
its
international
listing
and
some
observers
have
even
argued
that
riyadh
might
opt
for
a
private
placement
instead
so
as
to
ensure
the
entire
percent
that
is
set
to
be
offered
will
find
a
s
ipo
is
crucial
for
vision
as
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
will
be
the
fuel
that
this
ambitious
plan
runs
on
while
analysts
disagree
strongly
on
exactly
how
much
aramco
is
worth
it
s
clear
that
the
higher
oil
prices
are
the
higher
the
valuation
for
this
oil
giant
will
a
strong
rally
at
the
end
of
and
the
beginning
of
brent
and
wti
have
both
fallen
from
their
multiyear
highs
as
the
fast
growth
in
shale
production
offsets
the
opec
cuts
despite
oecd
inventories
nearing
their
average
oil
prices
are
refusing
to
rally
in
fact
some
analysts
are
warning
that
the
price
slide
we
saw
this
month
is
only
the
beginning
of
a
much
bigger
saudi
arabia
wants
oilriyadh
doesn
t
want
to
hear
this
prior
to
the
ipo
it
s
not
something
the
saudis
want
to
hear
in
the
coming
years
either
because
the
price
of
oil
doesn
t
just
need
to
be
higher
now
it
needs
to
remain
high
in
the
near
to
medium
term
to
ensure
the
aramco
ipo
s
what
s
an
oil
kingdom
to
do
last
week
energy
minister
khalid
suggested
that
opec
should
change
the
way
it
measures
global
inventories
because
the
current
method
produces
unreliable
data
the
current
method
is
based
on
the
average
inventory
level
for
the
members
of
the
oecd
but
that
average
is
a
moving
target
as
oilprice
s
nick
cunningham
recently
noted
and
in
the
last
five
years
it
has
reflected
a
substantial
glut
so
based
on
the
oecd
average
the
market
rebalancing
may
turn
out
to
be
a
reduction
of
the
overhang
as
opposed
to
an
impressive
reduction
in
the
global
oil
course
there
s
always
the
possibility
of
a
conflict
in
the
middle
east
driving
oil
prices
up
but
geopolitical
unrest
is
far
from
a
guarantee
the
recent
unconfirmed
and
likely
to
never
be
confirmed
reports
about
saudi
arabia
working
together
with
israel
to
thwart
iran
s
growing
influence
in
the
region
were
followed
this
week
by
an
open
warning
from
tel
aviv
that
it
s
ready
to
confront
iran
directly
and
iran
issuing
an
threat
that
promised
to
level
tel
for
oil
price
analysts
these
growing
tensions
can
never
be
factor
that
no
producer
can
control
is
demand
for
now
demand
forecasts
are
overwhelmingly
rosy
but
some
observers
are
wary
of
too
much
optimism
higher
prices
themselves
are
a
negative
factor
for
demand
saudi
arabia
is
once
again
ready
to
do
whatever
it
takes
to
push
prices
up
but
in
an
increasingly
complex
oil
market
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
the
oil
kingdom
can
achieve
