what’s behind china’s record oil imports?
china
imported
a
volume
of
crude
oil
in
october
beating
the
previous
high
set
in
april
this
year
the
oil
market
gripped
by
a
strong
bearish
sentiment
last
week
largely
ignored
the
chinese
oil
imports
at
the
world
s
top
importer
will
continue
to
grow
but
last
month
s
record
was
determined
not
only
by
was
influenced
by
factors
that
boosted
oil
intake
according
to
reuters
columnist
clyde
crude
oil
imports
continue
to
be
propped
up
by
economic
growth
at
over
percent
which
however
has
slowed
down
in
recent
months
with
the
trade
war
other
factors
driving
oil
demand
growth
include
declining
domestic
crude
oil
production
with
mature
fields
depleting
and
the
building
up
of
strategic
petroleum
in
october
two
factors
also
contributed
to
the
record
chinese
crude
oil
sanctions
on
iran
and
the
approaching
expiry
date
for
china
s
smaller
independent
refiners
to
use
up
their
oil
import
quotas
various
estimates
show
that
china
significantly
boosted
its
crude
oil
imports
from
iran
last
month
just
before
the
sanctions
snapped
back
on
november
and
before
the
announcement
that
waivers
were
granted
and
before
independent
imported
a
record
high
volume
of
crude
oil
in
october
to
fully
use
their
quotas
for
this
going
forward
china
s
total
crude
oil
imports
may
not
continue
to
break
record
highs
as
demand
from
teapots
will
likely
ease
and
as
there
won
t
be
such
a
rush
for
iranian
oil
all
the
more
so
that
china
was
among
the
eight
countries
granted
waivers
by
the
to
continue
importing
iran
s
oil
at
least
until
may
next
the
factors
underpinning
china
s
continued
and
oil
demand
growth
are
declining
domestic
production
and
an
expanding
economy
although
gdp
is
now
rising
at
a
slower
pace
than
earlier
this
year

earlier
according

crude

fell

its
part
expanded
by
percent
annually
at
comparable
prices
between

and

the

data
showed
however
the
pace
of
growth
has
been
slowing
this

from

to
prop
up

economy
the
stimulus
could
boost
china
s
imports
in
all
sectors
in
according
to
ing
which
sees
china
s
exports
growth
in
october
as
a
possible
sign
that
chinese
exporters
are
concerned
that
more

are
coming
