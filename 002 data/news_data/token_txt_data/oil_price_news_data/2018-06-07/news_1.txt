venezuela
is
pleading
with
opec
for
solidarity
against
sanctions
a
week
after
iran
also
asked
its
fellow
cartel
members
for
support
against
the
returning
sanctions
on
i
kindly
request
solidarity
and
support
from
our
fellow
members
venezuela
s
oil
minister
manuel
quevedo
wrote
in
a
letter
to
opec
seen
by
bloomberg
the
letter
quevedo
is
calling
upon
the
cartel
to
discuss
the
constraining
effects
of
unilateral
sanctions
imposed
by
the
united
states
of
america
which
represent
an
extraordinary
aggression
financially
and
economically
for
our
national
oil
industry
s
operations
and
the
stability
of
the
the
letter
by
venezuela
is
similar
to
the
one
that
iran
sent
to
opec
last
week
in
which
tehran
sought
support
from
fellow
opec
members
against
the
returning
sanctions
and
wanted
the
issue
on
the
agenda
at
the
vienna
meeting
later
this
his
letter
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
zangeneh
also
suggested
that
his
country
does
not
agree
with
recent
remarks
by
certain
opec
members
noting
that
the
organization
adopted
decisions
by
consensus
and
no
single
member
spoke
for
the
this
comment
could
be
setting
the
stage
for
a
difficult
opec
meeting
all
the
more
so
that
it
was
iran
s
archrival
saudi
arabia
that
hinted
that
the
cartel
and
allies
may
discuss
easing
the
production
cuts
in
for
its
part
is
said
to
be
nearing
the
point
in
which
it
may
have
to
declare
force
majeure
on
its
oil
exports
as
production
plunges
and
its
ports
are
unable
to
ship
enough
crude

corn
states

fight
against

iran
and
venezuela
are
currently
the
two
key
oil
supply
concerns
globally
that
supported
the
oil
price
rally
in
recent
weeks
before
saudi
arabia
and
russia
hinted
at
discussions
that
they
were
considering
reversing
some
of
the
cuts
to
offset
production
losses
and
ease
market
and
consumer
if
the
partners
in
the
production
cut
deal
decide
to
raise
production
and
if
this
move
depresses
oil
prices
iran
and
venezuela
will
be
two
of
the
biggest
losers
from
lower
oil
revenues
because
they
can
t
raise
their
respective
production
levels
also
