iranian oil production could be about to plunge
the
european
union
has
vowed
to
maintain
the
iran
nuclear
deal
despite
the
decision
to
exit
and
brussels
has
pushed
back
against
washington
s
attempts
to
penalize
european
companies
from
doing
business
with
iran
however
the
early
evidence
suggests
that
the
eu
is
struggling
to
keep
the
deal
alive
as
european
companies
have
already
begun
cutting
business
ties
with
the
islamic
has
only
been
a
few
weeks
since
the
trump
administration
announced
its
withdrawal
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
and
we
are
still
several
months
away
from
the
deadline
for
when
sanctions
begin
to
bite
however
the
treasury
has
advised
businesses
to
begin
unwinding
their
business
in
iran
immediately
and
there
are
more
than
a
few
examples
that
suggest
international
companies
are
heeding
that
advice
or
threat
to
the
wall
street
journal
a
series
of
american
companies
that
had
been
doing
business
with
iran
under
a
technical
loophole
are
now
ending
their
ties
a
list
that
includes
honeywell
international
dover
and
general
electric
the
announcement
from
ge
was
one
of
the
more
notable
decisions
since
the
conglomerate
was
selling
oil
and
natural
gas
equipment
to
iran
ge
s
foreign
subsidiaries
had
plans
for
as
much
as
million
worth
of
business
but
is
now
pulling
the
plug
entirely
meanwhile
airplane
manufacturer
boeing
is
set
to
miss
out
on
some
billion
in
sales
to
wsj
says
an
estimated
american
companies
began
commercial
activity
with
iran
after
the
nuclear
deal
went
into
effect
in
early
related
venezuela
s
oil
meltdown
defies
beliefstill
the
exit
of
european
firms
is
even
more
significant
not
least
because
european
firms
had
larger
plans
for
iran
than
their
american
counterparts
following
the
signing
of
the
nuclear
deal
total
sa
is
at
the
top
of
the
list
the
french
oil
giant
had
a
billion
deal
to
develop
the
latest
phase
of
the
south
pars
natural
gas
field
a
project
it
ran
with
china
s
cnpc
total
was
the
only
major
western
oil
company
to
ink
a
deal
with
iran
since
the
lifting
of
sanctions
more
than
two
years
ago
total
is
going
to
hand
off
its
stake
in
the
gas
project
to
cnpc
and
pull
out
of
the
cancellation
of
promised
investment
in
iran
is
painful
a
more
significant
impact
will
be
how
sanctions
affect
oil
production
and
exports
already
there
are
signs
that
here
too
the
trump
administration
is
having
an
shipping
giant
said
it
would
no
longer
ship
iranian
oil
on
its
fleet
with
the
sanctions
the
americans
are
to
impose
you
can
t
do
business
in
iran
if
you
also
have
business
in
the
and
we
have
that
on
a
large

in
of
the
more
surprising
announcements
came
from

an

company
which
said
it

no

import
iranian

india

market

also
a
crucial

despite
assurances
of
support
from
the
european
union
as
insurance
shipping

financial
giants
cut

with

buying

is
becoming
more

more
difficult

can
not

it
is
not
clear
yet
what
the

can
do
but
in
practice
we
can
get

that
total
eni
spain
s
repsol
and

and
greece
s
hellenic

are
all
reducing
or
ceasing
oil
purchases
from
iran
as
reuters
notes
these
companies
account
for
most
of
europe
s
refining
exodus
of
international
business
is
leading
to
rising
frustration
in
iran
this
week
iran
said
that
it
would
ramp
up
work
on
its
nuclear
program
if
the
eu
is
unable
to
offer
enough
security
to
ensure
european
companies
can
continue
to
operate
in
iran
to
be
sure
iran
s
nuclear
plans
would
remain
within
the
limits
of
the
international
accord
but
the
comments
are
a
signal
that
the
islamic
republic
might
ultimately
lose
patience
with
the
constraints
of
the
nuclear
deal
now
that
the
benefits
are
rapidly
estimates
for
how
much
iranian
oil
sanctions
will
impact
ranges
perhaps
as
little
as
a
few
hundred
thousand
barrels
per
day
or
maybe
as
much
as
million
barrels
per
day
at
first
blush
the
vow
from
the
eu
to
continue
with
the
nuclear
deal
immediately
after
president
trump
announced
his
withdrawal
seemed
to
offer
reassurance
that
any
disruptions
would
be
the
mass
flight
of
top
american
and
european
companies
and
the
early
signs
of
a
significant
decline
in
purchases
from
refiners
around
the
world
plus
the
difficulty
in
finding
shipping
and
insurance
all
suggests
that
the
supply
disruptions
could
potentially
be
at
the
higher
