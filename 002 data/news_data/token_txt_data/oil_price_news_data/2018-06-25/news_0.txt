gasoline price set to soar despite opec+ deal
nearly
everyone
expected
the
decision
to
start
raising
oil
production
on
friday
with
drivers
excited
to
get
some
relief
from
high
gas
prices
at
the
start
of
driving
season
while
opec
did
indeed
announce
the
expected
decision
oil
prices
jumped
and
they
look
unlikely
to
trend
downward
any
time
soon
for
ministers
claimed
the
group
would
increase
its
overall
production
by
a
million
barrels
per
day
but
the
increase
is
likely
to
be
much
lower
because
some
members
venezuela
and
iran
in
particular
will
find
it
difficult
to
increase
their
current
level
of
production
exactly
how
much
of
an
increase
we
will
see
remains
unclear
but
the
very
fact
that
the
production
jump
will
be
smaller
than
traders
had
hoped
for
has
been
enough
to
send
prices
fact
all
opec
said
in
its
statement
after
the
friday
meeting
was
that
it
will
rein
in
its
compliance
rate
from
the
percent
for
may
to
percent
estimates
made
on
this
basis
suggested
the
actual
increase
will
be
a
bit
over
bpd
with
another
bpd
to
come
from
russia
and
signatories
to
the
deal
that
s
not
in
the
statement
either
it
came
from
nigeria
s
oil
minister
emmanuel
ibe
wonder
then
that
wti
booked
a
rise
of
percent
last
week
and
though
it
might
ease
off
the
current
highs
it
will
hardly
fall
low
enough
for
drivers
to
be
happy
driving
season
means
greater
demand
for
gasoline
and
greater
demand
invariably
means
higher
prices
also
as
gasbuddy
senior
petroleum
analyst
dan
mcteague
told
npr
driving
season
also
sees
refineries
churn
out
more
fuels
that
are
costlier
to
produce
related
saudi
oil
minister
agreement
is
just
the
beginning
my
guess
is
that
you
are
going
to
see
sustained
higher
prices
at
least
for
the
foreseeable
future
end
of
the
summer
mcteague
said
rubbing
salt
into
the
wound
by
adding
that
prices
at
the
pump
this
year
are
likely
to
be
possibly
the
highest
since
at
least
makes
perfect
sense
since
crude
oil
prices
are
now
the
highest
in
more
than
three
years
but
not
everybody
is
so
pessimistic
the
aaa
npr
reports
is
actually
upbeat
about
gas
prices
expecting
the
beneficial
effect
of
higher
opec
and
russia
production
to
make
itself
visible
some
time
later
when
the
production
increase
actually
the
other
hand
the
strength
of
this
effect
might
not
be
particularly
great
again
for
seasonal
reasons
what
we
are
seeing
is
a
fairly
typical
pattern
energy
outlook
analyst
timothy
hess
from
the
energy
information
administration
told
npr
prices
at
the
pump
will
likely
inch
up
as
july
weekend
approaches
with
the
eia
projecting
peak
summer
prices
of
per
gallon
next
seasonal
supply
and
demand
dynamics
aside
it
is
likely
that
traders
were
just
too
optimistic
about
opec
and
russia
s
meeting
last
week
possibly
expecting
russia
to
prevail
with
its
proposed
million
bpd
increase
in
total
production
although
that
claim
was
highly
questionable
from
the
reports
suggested
the
was
a
tactical
move
to
get
the
more
unwilling
opec
members
on
the
output
increase
train
by
first
hitting
them
with
the
proposal
and
then
lowering
it
to
a
more
palatable
level
if
that
was
the
case
the
goal
was
accomplished
unfortunately
this
won
t
help
drivers

summer
