audit puts aramcoâ€™s oil reserves at 270 billion barrels
an
international
independent
audit
of
the
oil
reserves
of
saudi
aramco
has
more
than
confirmed
the
official
figures
released
by
riyadh
for
three
decades
putting
the
number
at
billion
barrels
two
unnamed
sources
close
to
the
company
told
audit
was
conducted
by
companies
including
degolyer
and
macnaughton
and
baker
hughes
gaffney
cline
and
associates
it
is
being
watched
closely
because
the
reserve
base
of
the
company
will
have
a
direct
bearing
on
its
valuation
ahead
of
the
initial
public
figure
may
come
as
something
of
a
surprise
because
for
thirty
years
aramco
has
been
reporting
unchanged
reserves
of
about
billion
barrels
despite
active
production
yet
barrels
are
not
the
only
factor
considered
in
an
oil
company
s
valuation
as

noted
in
an
analysis
earlier
this
year
even
though
they
are
an
important
indicator
of
the
company
s
viability
and
bloomberg
this
month
took
a
look
at
aramco
s
accounts
reporting
that
the
company
booked
a
net
profit
of
us
billion
for
the
first
half
of
the
significance
of
the
figures
was
naturally
questioned
by
skeptic
analysts
aware
that
balance
sheets
can
be
adjusted
to
present
the
information
about
a
company
s
performance
in
the
most
favorable
way
related

break
its
oil
addiction
bloomberg
itself
made
a
note
of
pointing
out
that
despite
aramco
s
negligible
debt
levels
and
production
costs
the
company
is
saudi
arabia
s

cash
flow
is
not
great
because
such
a
large
part
of
the
saudi
economy
and
society
literally
depend
on
aramco
interestingly
enough
aramco
said
the
numbers
were
inaccurate
adding
that
they
were
mere
company
is
also
understandably
sensitive
to
oil
prices
which
is
why
saudi
officials
have
been
pushing
so
vehemently
for
higher
oil
prices
ahead
of
the
ipo
now
they
seem
to
be
aiming
