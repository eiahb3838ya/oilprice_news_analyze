iran blames opec for vague output agreement
opec
and
its
partners
including
russia
have
agreed
to
increase
oil
production
after
meetings
on
friday
and
saturday
the
production
increase
will
start
in
july
by
measurable
supply
boosts
but
without
specific
numbers
being
of
the
highlights
of
the
opec
meeting
on
friday
was
predictable
stark
disagreement
between
opec
de
facto
leader
saudi
arabia
and
regional
rival
iran
opec
s
third
largest
producer
which
likely
led
to
no
specific
output
numbers
being
agreed
opec
and
partners
did
say
in
statements
that
they
would
raise
supply
by
returning
to
percent
compliance
with
previously
agreed
output
energy
minister
khalid
said
this
implied
an
indirect
reallocation
of
extra
production
from
countries
unable
to
produce
more
oil
to
those
such
as
his
own
and
the
other
gulf
opec
members
that
are
able
to
do
so
he
added
that
opec
and
combined
would
pump
roughly
an
extra
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
coming
months
equal
to
percent
of
global

hossein

no

a
long

coming
from

oil
producing
cartel
and
its
members
the
obvious
elephant
in
the
room
over
a
more
cohesive
opec
deal
is
iranian

over

has
also

up

trump
makes
two
mistakes
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
namdar
zanganeh
told
the
first
one
is
that
he
thinks
that
he
will
witness
regime
change
in
iran
very
soon
which
is
a
big
mistake
and
his
second
mistake
is
that
he
thinks
there
is
a
capacity
in
the
world
for
a
major
excess
production
of
oil
this
is
also
a
mistake
he
has
said
previously
it
will
remain
committed
to
the
nuclear
deal
reached
with
western
powers
for
the
time
being
pending
negotiations
with
other
signatories
of
the
agreement
to
see
if
iran
s
interests
would
still
be
protected
under
an
accord
without
the
given
that
iran
has
already
tried
to
press
eu
members
for
more
action
both
collectively
and
individually
with
minimal
success
as
well
as
appealing
to
opec
for
help
there
is
a
real
chance
that
iran
will
break
its
terms
of
the
deal
raising
the
geopolitical
stakes
with
the
as
well
as
furthering
tensions
with
riyadh
both
within
opec
and
while
jockeying
for
regional
hegemony
in
the
region
related
a
storm
is
brewing

arabia
amid
recent
pressure
from
trump
to
increase
oil
production
and

causes
considerable
anger
with
iranian
leaders

can
be

this
out

according

a

by

gain
