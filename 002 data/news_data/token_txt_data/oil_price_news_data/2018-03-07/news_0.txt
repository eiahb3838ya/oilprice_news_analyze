u.s. oil export boom boosts pipeline demand
the
could
add
around
million
barrels
per
day
of
additional
supply
in
the
coming
years
and
most
of
it
will
be
shipped
abroad
turning
the
into
a
major
oil
of
the
new
supply
will
come
in
the
form
of
light
sweet
and
oil
but
because
refineries
along
the
gulf
coast
are
largely
equipped
to
handle
medium
and
heavy
crude
the
new
production
probably
won
t
find
a
home
inside
the
new
study
from
wood
mackenzie
predicts
that
only
about
bpd
of
the
additional
supply
will
be
taken
up
in
the
domestic
market
leaving
more
than
for
export
should
those
aggressive
production
forecasts
play
out
meanwhile
bernstein
research
was
even
more
definitive
arguing
that
essentially
all
new
additional
supply
will
be
shipped
the

forecasts
that
crude
export
capacity
could
hit
nearly
by
estimates
that
initially
a
lot
of
the
exported
crude
will
head
to
europe
where
refining
values
are
high
however
oil
will
have
to
compete
with
crude
coming
from
west
africa
once
the
european
market
is
saturated
shale
oil
will
be
rerouted
to
asia
hefty
transportation
costs
to
asia
will
force
shipments
to
be
offered
at
a
steep
discount
if
they
are
to
be
competitive
nevertheless
it
seems
likely
that
exports
will
steadily
ratchet
the
flood
of
new
oil
coming
from
the
shale
fields
will
require
an
overhaul
of
pipeline
and
export
terminals
along
the
gulf
coast
the
permian
basin
is
expected
to
lead
the
way
adding

of
additional
supply
by

the
basin
is

bottlenecks

new

the

begun
ferrying

to

in

erasing
what

continuing

more

the

expanding

the
