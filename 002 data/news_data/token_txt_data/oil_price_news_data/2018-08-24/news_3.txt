friday
august
prices
are
on
track
to
close
out
the
week
with
strong
gains
after
several
weeks
of
declines
the
eia
data
showing
a
steep
decline
in
crude
stocks
helped
push
prices
up
on
wednesday
and
return
a
sense
of
bullishness
to
the
market
both
crude
markers
are
on
track
to
end
a
steady
run
of
weekly
declines
this
is
largely
due
to
a
tightening
fundamental
outlook
on
the
back
of
looming
iranian
supply
shortages

report
reuters
reported
that
the
saudi
aramco
ipo
has
officially
been
scrapped
and
financial
advisers
working
on
the
planned
listing
have
been
disbanded
ending
what
would
have
been
the
largest
public
offering
in
history
the
decision
to
call
off
the
ipo
was
taken
some
time
ago
but
can
disclose
this
so
statements
are
gradually
going
that
way

calling
off
a
saudi
source
familiar
with
the
ipo
plans
told
reuters
both
the
domestic
and
international
listing
have
apparently
been
called
off
and
instead
saudi
aramco
may
take
a
large

but
already
countries
around
the
world
have
been
slashing

which
are
affecting
iran
s

reports
indicate
that
iranian
tanker

are
already
down

in
the
first

of

relative
to

which
if
it

said
on
friday
we
expect
that
by
the
market
will
be
dealing
with
either
undersupply

talks

lower

trade
talks
between
the

china
ended
on
thursday
with
no
major
breakthrough
meanwhile
the
billion
in
tariffs
from
both
sides
went
into
effect
this
week
china
s
slate
of
tariffs
targeted
energy
products
including
butane
propane
naptha
jet
fuel
and
coal
among
other
items
but
because
china
has
declined
to
include
crude
oil
on
the
list
of
tariffs
for
now
at

unipec

according

water
costs
in
permian
the
cost
of
handling
and
disposing
of
produced
water
that
comes
out
of
an
oil
well
is
rising
in
the
permian
just
another
in
a
long
line
of
stretched
services
companies
typically
truck
the
water
away
for
disposal
but
more
recently
have
been
building
pipelines
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
in
some
parts
of
the
permian
wells
produce
ten
times
as
much
water
as
they
do
oil
and
gas
according
to
woodmac
costs
are
rising
and
water
management
can
add
as
much
as
per
barrel
to
the
cost
of
producing
a
barrel
of
oil
as
a
result
water
costs
alone
could
shave
off

mexico

obrador
amlo
is
planning
to
hold
off
on
new
oil

auctions
for
two
years
while
also
modifying
the
laws
to
bolster
the
role
of
pemex
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
instead
of
rolling
back
the
energy
reforms
which
would
require
a
constitutional
change
amlo
will
reportedly
pursue
tweaks
to
the
laws
through
legislation
such
changes
include
allowing
pemex
to
choose
partners
without
needing
regulatory
approval
allowing
the
government
to
directly
hand

fossil

norway
s
trillion
sovereign
wealth
fund
had
proposed
divesting
from
fossil
fuel
investments
but
a
government
appointed
commission
has
advised
against
the
move
this
investment
strategy
is
simple
well
founded
and
has
served
the
fund
well
the
commission
report
said
if
energy
stocks
are
excluded
from
the
fund
the
composition
of
the
investments
will
differ
from
market
weights
and
the
fund
will
be
expected
to
either
achieve
lower
return

the

to

over
fears
of
deepening

but
mcclatchy
reports
that

are
back
on

the
report
suggests
that
while
the

is
considering
the
nuclear
option
of
banning
purchases
of
venezuela
s
oil
the
more
likely
scenario
will
be
a
narrower
ban
on
the
export
of

the

would
