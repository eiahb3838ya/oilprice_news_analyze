projected
in
the
second
quarter
according
to
mexico
s
national
statistics
institute
though
just
a
percent
contraction
was
estimated
for

the
numbers
now
show
that
mexico
s
gdp
declined
at
double
the
rate
down

from
the

in
seasonally

such
as

compared
with
a

in
the
first
quarter
industrial
sectors
including
mining
construction
and
manufacturing
actually
declined
by
percent
while
agriculture
livestock
and
fishing
industries
showed
even
bigger
signs
of
trouble
with
a
percent
spite
of
the
stall
mexico
s
economy
is
still
projected
to
expand
more
rapidly
this
year
than
in
thanks
to
accelerated
spending
before
the
july
presidential
election
the

is
expected
to
increase
by

this
year
and

in
according
to
analysts
in
a
survey
released
by
citigroup
that
being
said
nothing
is
certain
and
the
trajectory
over
the
coming
year
will
be
a
rough
one
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
recently
downgraded
its
forecast
for
mexico
s
growth
financial
growth
in
reportedly
due
to
trade
tensions
and
current
political
instability
concerning
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement
nafta
and
the
leftist
s
coming
policy
mexican
president
andres
manuel
lopez
obrador
locally
known
as
amlo
further
catalyzed
economic
concern
this
month
when
he
announced
his
plans
to
hold
a
public
referendum
over
whether
to
cancel
the
upcoming
billion
that
s
usd
not
pesos
construction
of
a
new
international
airport
for
mexico
city
the
country
s
capital
and
largest
metropolitan
area
by
far
the
project
was
the
biggest
infrastructural
undertaking
of
sitting
president
enrique
pena
nieto
and
amlo
has
stated
that
on
top
of
pressing
environmental
concerns
the
planned
airport
is
far
too
expensive
and
entangled
in
many
layers
of
the
next
major
challenge
for
norway
s
oil
industryanother
reason
for
wavering
confidence
in
the
future
of
the
mexican
economy
is
the
review
of
oil
contracts
amlo
has
promised
to
check
over
contracts
for
telltale
signs
of
corruption
and
has
also
raised
eyebrows
by
appointing
an
industry
newcomer
to
lead
the
oil
company
petroleos
mexicanos
pemex
the
largest
oil
producer
in
the
country
the
will
also
halt
any
new
oil
auctions
for
the
next
two
years
serious
change
however
could
be
what
pemex
needs
as
they
are
currently
over
billion
in
debt
after
consecutive
years
of
declining
output
widespread
and
violent
fuel
theft
and
international
corruption
the
first
leftist
president
mexico
has
elected
in
decades
has
also
promised
expanded
spending
on
social
programs
for
marginalized
communities
such
as
the
elderly
and
youth
in
addition
to
a
major
investment
of
billion
pesos
billion
in
the
oil
industry
to
be
financed
through
increased
government
efficiency
and
a

institutional
corruption
some
critics
and
economists
however
doubt
that
this
will
really
be
possible
without
reaching
into
the
pockets
of
mexican
the
discouraging
discourse
some
experts
are
saying
that
things
are
not
as
bad
as
they
look
for
the
mexican
economy
bill

senior
economist
at

group
told
bloomberg
that
employment
growth
is
steady
and
healthy
in
mexico
and
that
this
quarter
s
stall
is
just
the
result
of
a
particularly
strong
first
or
not
the
concerns
over
the
mexican
economy
are
worth
paying
attention
to
in
the
coming
months
