trade war truce with china boosts oil prices
on
saturday
there
was
a
sign
of
hope
that
ongoing
trade
tensions
between
washington
and
beijing
could
be
remedied
beijing
said
that
it
agreed
to
significantly
increase
its
purchases
of
american
goods
and
services
including
energy
and
agricultural
disclosure
came
after
the
conclusion
of
intensive
trade
talks
in
washington
between
the
two
sides
a
joint
statement
said
there
was
a
consensus
on
taking
effective
measures
to
substantially
reduce
the
united
states
trade
deficit
in
goods
with
to
meet
the
growing
consumption
needs
of
the
chinese
people
and
the
need
for
economic
development
china
will
significantly
increase
purchases
of
united
states
goods
and
however
the
two
sides
did
not
indicate
if
they
would
either
delay
or
drop
trade
tariffs
threats
first
initiated
in
march
by
president
trump
and
followed
up
by
dollar
amount
of
increased
chinese
procurement
also
wasn
t
reached
though
trump
has
recently
called
for
a
billion
target
to
close
the
massive
billion
annual
trade
gap
between
the
two
global
times
a
nationalistic
newspaper
which
often
expresses
the
views
of
the
chinese
communist
party
ccp
touted
the
talks
as
a
major
breakthrough
in
an
article
titled
china
us
reach
victory
with
trade
war
truce
it
said
that
the
trade
deficit
has
continued
to
expand
despite
china
working
to
reduce
this
number
for
many
the
piece
took
issue
with
the
official
trade
deficit
amount
stating
that
it
was
billion
in
instead
of
billion
as
trade
figures
show
the
article
also
noted
that
at
first
blush
it
looks
like
the
chinese
concession
seems
to
be
a
win
however
it
said
it
was
a
development
the
us
will
have
the
opportunity
to
reduce
its
trade
deficit
with
china
while
china
will
achieve
the
consistent
purchase
of
us
goods
to
benefit
the
development
of
the
country
and
its
people
life
it
added
related
the
sword
of
high
oil
pricesin
this
regard
the
global
times
piece
is
correct
at
least
as
far
as
stating
that
china
will
purchase
more
goods
to
its
own
benefit
this
is
particularly
true
in
regard
to
energy
products
from
the
both
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
imports
and
senior
official
said
that
during
discussions
with
a
member
of
chinese
president
xi
jinping
s
office
china
was
considering
a
package
that
relied
on
major
purchases
of
lng
including
a
contract
for
a
firm
to
build
lng
receiving
and
processing
facilities
in
gas
demandnot
only
does
china
need
to
offset
the
trade
imbalance
with
the
but
it
also
needs
american
natural
gas
china
is
increasing
its
gas
usage
per
government
mandate
for
the
cleaner
burning
fuel
to
make
up
at
least
percent
of
its
energy
mix
by
to
offset
record
air
pollution
levels
with
further
earmarks
by
december
the
international
energy
agency
iea
said
that
china
demand
for
natural
gas
will
continue
to
soar
toward
outstripping
domestic
output
by
around
percent
china
annual
gas
production
will
more
than
double
to
billion
cubic
meters
bcm
in
with
shale
gas
a
major
contributor
but
consumption
is
foreseen
to
grow
even
faster
reaching
billion
cubic
meters
the
agency
the
will
become
the
world
s
third
largest
lng
exporter
by
the
end
of
the
decade
when
at
least
five
major
lng
export
project
are
operational
it
s
simply
in
china
s
best
interest
to
not
only
sign
off
take
agreements
with
lng
producers
for
both
the
security
of
supply
that
american
gas
offers
but
also
the
cost
savings
related
fire
risk
slows
down
battery
boommost
long
and
lng
contracts
especially
in
the
asia
pacific
region
are
based
on
an
oil
indexation
formula
with
costs
such
as
transportation
and
liquefaction
added
lng
for
its
part
is
based
on
henry
hub
gas
prices
and
offers
a
savings
over
oil
indexation
this
is
particularly
true
in
a
high
oil
price
china
will
likely
enter
in
numerous
supply
contracts
with
lng
producers
this
development
as
well
as
importing
more
agricultural
commodities
will
still
not
be
enough
to
offset
the
trade
that
to
happen
there
needs
to
be
fundamental
and
systemic
changes
in
the
trade
of
goods
and
services
between
the
two
countries
one
remedy
which
will
likely
not
materialize
in
the
near
future
would
be
to
let
the
chinese
yuan
rnb
have
a
floating
exchange
rate
that
is
determined
by
market
would
help
level
the
playing
field
between
china
and
not
only
the
but
other
trading
partners
that
take
issue
with
china
including
eu
members
a
chinese
currency
would
also
allow
american
companies
to
compete
with
china

low
costs
while
reducing
significantly
the
trade
imbalance
and
corresponding
geopolitical
ramifications
