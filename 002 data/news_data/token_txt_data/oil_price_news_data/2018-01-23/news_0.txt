the biggest year yet for u.s. shale
shale
companies
are
expected
to
ramp
up
production
this
year
and
higher
oil
prices
could
lead
to
the
industry
turning
profits
for
the
first
years
the
shale
promise
has
been
hollow
even
when
oil
prices
were
trading
above
per
barrel
most
shale
drillers
weren
t
profitable
they
drilled
rapidly
brought
huge
volumes
of
production
online
in
short
order
and
upended
the
global
oil
market
any
cash
they
recouped
they
ploughed
back
into
the
ground
the
debt
taken
on
to
drill
new
wells
was
made
on
the
assumption
that
future
growth
would
translate
into
bigger
earnings
and
like
any
industry
growing
quickly
wall
street
was
quick
to
pour
money
into
evermore
spending
has
vastly
outpaced
earnings
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
the
shale
industry
has
spent
billion
more
than
it
has
generated
since
collapse
of
oil
prices
forced
a
deep
contraction
with
lots
of
defaults
layoffs
and
bankruptcies
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
wall
street
was
lured
back
in
on
the
promise
of
lower
breakeven
costs
and
substantial
efficiency
profits
still
proved
to
be
elusive
only
last
year
did
major
investors
start
demanding
big
changes
that
led
to
shale
executives
committing
to
a
more
prudent
and
strategy
which
called
for
more
conservative
drilling
programs
and
an
emphasis
on
cash
and
profits
over
oil
prices
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
higher
compared
to
just
a
few
months
ago
the
shale
industry
could
quite
possibly
have
its
cake
and
eat
it
too
the
wsj
notes
that
the
industry
has
all
the
ingredients
it
needs
for
to
be
a
profitable
one
a
first
for
the
industry
that
could
occur
simultaneously
with
enormous
volumes
of
fresh
supply

venezuela
claims
to
be
able
to
boost
oil
production
by
bpdshale
drillers
have
lower
breakeven
prices
and
so
far
they
appear
poised
to
keep
spending
in
check
an
analysis
by
jeffries
finds
that
a
group
of
small
shale
companies
are
planning
on
increasing
spending
this
year
by
a
modest
percent
a
sign
of
restraint
after
hiking
spending
by
percent
last
oil
prices
are
sharply
higher
right
now
than
they
were
last
year
granting
an
unexpected
windfall
to
the
industry
on
top
of
that
a
lot
of
drillers
are
sitting
on
drilled
but
uncompleted
wells
ducs
which
basically
means
that
some
of
the
costs
have
already
been
accounted
for
if
some
of
those
wells
are
completed
this
year
it
will
lead
to
a
rush
of
new
supply
without
a
huge
spending
increase
the
duc
list
nearly
hit
in
december
up
more
than
percent
from
the
start
of
isn
t
all
smooth
sailing
however
particularly
if
explosive
shale
growth
undercuts
prices
but
is
shaping
up
to
be
the
brightest
year
yet
for
shale
there
is
always
a
risk
that
they
will
shoot
themselves
in
the
foot
again

but
unlike
in
the

this

around
the
companies
have
much
lower

better

robert

for

quarters
at

shale

could
