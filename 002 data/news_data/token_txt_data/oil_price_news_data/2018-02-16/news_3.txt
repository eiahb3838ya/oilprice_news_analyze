explaining saudi arabiaâ€™s oil export strategy
saudi
arabia
continues
to
keep
the
market
informed
about
its
stance
on
the
opec
production
cut
deal
with
khalid
latest
guidance
that
saudi
would
prefer
to
overtighten
the
market
than
exit
early
from
cuts
channeling
neil
young
better
to
burn
out
than
fade
away
has
gained
a
great
deal
of
credibility
over
the
last
of
a
year
by
outlining
saudi
next
move
in
terms
of
exports
then
following
through
on
it
we
should
therefore
take
heed
from
his
latest
also
signaled
that
the
kingdom
will
continue
to
keep
its
crude
exports
in
check
next
month
holding
below
million
barrels
per
day
this
is
no
surprise
and
will
be
their
stance
until
at
least
the
saudi
aramco
can
see
from
our
clipperdata
that
a
good
deal
of
opec
success
in
lowering
oecd
inventories
has
been
by
directing
exports
to
emerging
markets
highlighted
before
that
saudi
arabia
took
about
million
barrels
off
the
global
market
last
year
via
lower
exports
the

below
highlights
the
change
in
emphasis
from
saudi
arabia
around
june
when
it
started
increasingly
favoring
sending
crude
to
asia
at
the
expense
of

coincides
with
the
strategy
shift
first
outlined
by
khalid
on
may
last
year
via
his

the

meant
it

we
have
also
seen
another
trend
emerge
in
the
last
year
in
conjunction
with
the
oil
production
cut
deal
that
of
higher
saudi
arabian
middle
distillate
exports
we
first
highlighted
in
march
of
last
year
that
saudi
arabia
could
be
supplementing
its
lost
revenues
from
the
opec
oil
production
cut
deal
by
exporting
more
can
see
from
our
clipperdata
below
that
saudi
middle
distillate
exports
outpaced
levels
in
each
of
the
last
seven
months
of
last
year
by
an
average
of
bpd
over
the
period
this
year
has
also
started
off
strongly
well
above
january
higher
refining
capacity
in
the
kingdom
could
explain
away
this
increase
as
could
higher
demand
as
we
discussed
earlier
this
week
it
is
interesting
that
the
increase
in
middle
distillate
exports
last
june
coincided
with
change
in
strategy
for
crude
exports
