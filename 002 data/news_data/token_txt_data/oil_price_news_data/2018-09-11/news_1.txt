new fuel efficiency rules could boost oil consumption
last
month
the
trump
administration
announced
that
it
would
replace
fuel
efficiency
standards
enacted
by
the
obama
administration
in
order
to
make
cars
safer
and
more
new
proposal
unveiled
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
the
department
of
transportation
would
freeze
corporate
average
fuel
economy
cafe
rules
from
through
under
the
obama
plan
the
targets
were
set
to
rise
each
trump
administration
estimated
that
the
new
rules
could
prevent
fatalities
each
year
and
reduce
the
cost
of
a
vehicle
by
more
than
they
also
claimed
that
the
new
rules
would
have
a
minimal
relative
impact
on
carbon
dioxide
emissions
probably
true
but
they
acknowledged
that
the
change
would
result
in
percent
higher
oil
administration
downplayed
the
impact
of
increasing
oil
consumption
by
an
estimated
million
barrels
per
day
stating
in
the
proposal
the
is
currently
producing
enough
oil
to
satisfy
nearly
all
of
its
energy
needs
and
is
projected
to
continue
to
do
so
or
become
a
net
energy
exporter
this
has
added
new
stable
supply
to
the
global
oil
market
and
reduced
the
urgency
of
the
to
conserve
i
strongly
disagree
with
this
argument
while
it
is
certainly
true
that
oil
production
has
soared
and
our
net
imports
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
have
fallen
sharply
they
still
amount
to
million
import
around
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
and
products
with
about
percent
of
that
originating
from
opec
countries
but
we
also
now
export
a
significant
amount
of
petroleum
products
as
well
as
around
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
which
is
why
our
net
imports
are
much
lower
than
our
crude
oil
imports
isn
t
certain
that
the
will
become
a
net
exporter
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
but
in
any
case
that
s
not
a
reason
to
forego
conservation
there
are
economic
reasons
national
security
reasons
and
environmental
reasons
for
conserving
in
discretionary
oil
consumption
will
either
reduce
oil
imports
or
increase
net
exports
either
scenario
will
result
in
an
improved
overall
trade
deficit
for
the
for
individual
consumers
reducing
discretionary
oil
consumption
will
keep
a
little
more
money
in
the
family
budget

pricesit
is
also
unlikely
that
the
will
be
a
net
exporter
thus
reductions
to
consumption
will
improve
energy
security
and
they
will
better
insulate
consumers
against
oil
price
are
also
the
environmental
issues
to
consider
oil
is
one
of
the
major
contributors
to
rising
carbon
dioxide
concentrations
in
the
atmosphere
reducing
oil
consumption
is
a
step
we
can
take
toward
reining
in
these
the
production
and
transport
of
oil
poses
a
risk
of
leaks
and
spills
as
a
society
we
agree
to
accept
these
risks
when
we
consume
oil
but
lowering
our
oil
consumption
would
reduce
the
it
goes
without
saying
that
oil
is
a
finite
resource
in
many
applications
there
are
no
economical
substitutes
conserving
oil
will
increase
the
lifetime
of
the
resource
and
allow
us
more
time
to
develop
economic
do
what
you
can
to
conserve
oil
