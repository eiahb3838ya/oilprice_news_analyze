can oil demand really peak within 5 years?
oil
demand
could
peak
as
soon
as
five
years
from
the
point
at
which
the
world
reaches
peak
oil
demand
has
become
something
of
a
cottage
industry
the
estimates
range
but
tend
to
fall
somewhere
around
or
later
however
two
new
predictions
just
out
this
week
put
peak
oil
demand
as
soon
as
the
perhaps
around
much
faster
than
almost
anybody
is
predicting
not
least
oil
companies
and
their
new
report
from
the
carbon
tracker
initiative
says
that
a
combination
of
technology
policy
and
necessity
will
translate
into
a
peaking
of
oil
demand
in
the
by
necessity
carbon
tracker
refers
to
the
need
to
transition
to
cleaner
energy
on
environmental
grounds
and
the
drive
to
avoid
the
geopolitical
pitfalls
of
energy
dependence
moreover
the
emerging
market
leapfrog
ultimately
means
that
oil
demand
destruction
could
happen
sooner
than
many
people
the
motor
of
change
now
lies
in
the
emerging
markets
which
is
where
all
the
growth
in
energy
demand
lies
the
carbon
tracker
report
argues
they
have
less
fossil
fuel
legacy
infrastructure
rising
energy
dependency
and
are
anxious
to
seize
the
opportunities
of
the
renewables
age
we
believe
it
highly
likely
therefore
that
emerging
markets
will
increasingly
source
their
energy
demand
growth
from
renewable
sources
not
from
fossil
the
adoption
of
renewables
at
such
a
blistering
rate
will
only
be
possible
because
costs
continue
to
fall
carbon
tracker
argues
that
the
rate
of
adoption
for
solar
pv
wind
batteries
and
electric
vehicles
will
follow
an
referring
to
a
period
of
slow
growth
that
suddenly
morphs
into
a
steep
growth
curve
after
it
passes
a
certain
rapid
adoption
of
clean
technologies
will
force
a
peak
in
fossil
fuel
demand
it
s
not
a
scenario
it
s
just
obvious

kingsmill
bond
new
energy
strategist
and
author
of
the
carbon
tracker
report
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
related
pipeline
problems
in
the
permian
are
overblowncarbon
tracker
argues
that
there
are
three
types
of
risk
stemming
from
the
coming
peak
systemic
risk
to
the
financial
system
country
risk
to
major
oil
producers
and
company
risk
to
entities
to
fossil
fuels
the
total
estimated
value
of
fossil
fuel
infrastructure
stands
at
about
trillion
the
group
this
week
a
report
from
norwegian
company
dnv
gl
comes
to
a
similar
conclusion
as
carbon
tracker
that
is
peak
oil
demand
will
arrive
in
the
next
or
so
the
transition
is
undeniable
said
dnv
ceo
remi
eriksen
according
to
the
the
one
hand
predicting
the
peak
may
not
seem
important
so
long
as
the
trajectory
in
a
rough
sense
is
understood
oil
consumption
will
eventually
give
way
to
efficiency
and
electrification
but
the
timing
of
the
peak
is
actually
pretty
important
because
even
though
complete
decarbonization
is
far
off
into
the
future
the
peak
occurs
early
on
in
the
transition
carbon
tracker
argues
that
looking
at
past
technology
transitions
peak
demand
tends
to
occur
when
the
upstart
technologies
capture
only
to
percent
of
the
importantly
the
period
around
the
peak
is
when
the
incumbents
start
to
suffer
from
the
disruption
incumbents
are
typically
impacted
during
the
peaking
phase
because
it
is
then
that
demand
for
their
products
peaks
carbon
tracker
argued
the
important
measurement
is
not
total
demand
but
the
change
in
demand
related
is
a
new
crisis
brewing
in
the
saudi
royal
family
in
other
words
while
some
skeptics
argue
that
the
world
will
need
fossil
fuels
for
decades
to
come
that
misses
the
importance
of
hitting
the
peak
the
real
pain
for
the
fossil
fuel
industry
comes
much
sooner
once
the
peak
is
hit
the
troubles
start
to
accelerate
demand
starts
to
fall
so
fossil
fuel
companies
face
lower
prices
for
their
products
lower
valuations
and
ultimately
stranded
assets
we
should
then
expect
a
major
reallocation
of
capital
bankruptcy
of
companies
that
are
unprepared
and
sector
restructuring
as
those
who
prepared
for
the
shift
take
over
the
assets
of
those
that
did
not
carbon
tracker
are
not
going
to
wait
for
the
complete
phase
out
of
fossil
fuels
before
they
start
to
redeploy
capital
and
shun
fossil
fuel
investments
that
shift
occurs
much
sooner
arguably
around
the
coal
industry
is
a
perfect
example
of
this
dynamic
coal
miners
have
gone
bankrupt
share
prices
are
in
the
toilet
and
yet
coal
still
accounts
for
around
a
third
of
electricity
the
disruption
happened
long
before
the
phase
out
of
coal
the
will
still
be
burning
coal
for
years
it
happened
when
demand
really
started
to
same
sort
of
disruption
could
start
to
hit
oil
and
gas
companies
as
soon
