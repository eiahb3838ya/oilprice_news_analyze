never trust a banker about oil prices
in
recent
weeks
i
ve
commented
on
the
powerful
bullish
forces
that
have
combined
in
oil
and
oil
stocks
and
your
need
to
increase
your
exposure
to
them
so
before
going
on
to
other
topics
this
has
to
be
the
start
of
any
column
until
further
notice
despite
the
weakness
in
stock
indexes
and
particularly
saudi
arabia
continue
to
drop
not
so
quiet
hints
about
the
importance
of
higher
oil
prices
for
the
cartel
and
the
upcoming
ipo
of
saudi
aramco
in
case
anyone
might
have
forgotten
about
their
chance
to
remake
their
entire
economy
and
culture
another
leak
of
saudi
oil
reserve
numbers
was
served
up
in
the
past
week
a
positive
one
of
of
the
analysts
who
previously
were
pessimistic
about
the
rise
in
oil
prices
have
been
slowly
and
steadily
raising
their
projections
that
should
neither
encourage
us
or
bother
us
as
bank
analysts
have
a
dismal
record
of
correctly
projecting
prices
much
into
the
future
one
should
always
trust
a
trader
first
whose
obligation
is
to
his
own
investments
and
money
and
not
to
retaining
the
respect
of
the
community
or
keeping
the
job
always
remember
an
analyst
s
first
priority
is
not
to
be
wrong
while
a
trader
doesn
t
care
if
he
s
wrong
or
right
only
if
he
s
got
the
right
side
of
the
trade
and
making
the
speculative
trade
from
hedge
funds
continues
to
be
almost
uniformly
long
a
fact
that
used
to
bother
me
much
more
in
the
days
when
bank
proprietary
trade
desks
dominated
the
speculators
in
those
days
their
own
positions
would
often
be
in
conflict
with
sales
and
chinese
wall
or
not
could
make
for
some
very
sticky
and
fast
reversals
of
positioning
inside
the
banks
when
most
speculators
were
on
one
side
of
the
market
prior
to
it
was
a
huge
siren
to
get
out
of
that
trade
before
the
avalanche
of
bank
traders
began
to
liquidate
i
used
to
call
this
the
porthole
effect
as
in
a
group
of
folks
on
a
boat
that
is
sinking
yet
only
has
one
porthole
available
for
exit
if
everyone
would
be
calm
the
departure
could
be
an
orderly
one
but
you
and
i
know
it
won
t
be
panic
is
sure
to
ensue
and
that
one
porthole
is
going
to
become
quickly
useless
to
oil
prices
up
as
iran
deal
hangs
in
the
balancenowadays
however
the
speculative
markets
are
dominated
by
machines
and
specifically
algorithmic
momentum
programs
they
don
t
care
what
prices
are
merely
making
multiple
thousands
of
calculations
a
second
to
determine
the
flow
of
trade
and
running
with
it
with
such
an
overflow
of
similar
and
emotionless
activity
we
need
to
expect
both
that
uniformity
will
appear
more
often
and
to
more
extreme
levels
and
that
the
exit
from
such
trades
when
it
comes
will
be
far
less
emotional
and
in
short
i
m
less
worried
about
a
porthole
effect
than
i
used
to
be
should
oil
come
off
the
rails
a
quarterly
reports
continue
to
come
in
and
they
have
mirrored
my
recommendations
for
stocks
for
the
most
part
we
ve
been
committed
to
companies
that
have
not
outspent
cash
flow
and
have
been
delivering
value
to
shareholders
in
one
of
three
ways
with
buybacks
dividends
and
debt
reduction
those
that
have
increased
production
at
all
cost
whether
major
or
independent
have
been
punished
by
shareholders
exxon
cimarex
concho
and
those
that
have
kept
to
a
disciplined
path
have
been
rewarded

golden
era

around

corner
finally
one
note
of
misstep
on
refiners
i
have
only
briefly
mentioned
refiners
as
a
choice
investment
to
use
in
the
last
several
months
when
it
seemed
that
s
were
lagging
so
using
refiners
as
a
holding
zone
for
capital
was
a
useful
way
to
keep
capital
active
but
hardly
took
advantage
of
the
amazing
move
that
refiners
have
continued
to
have
throughout
the
last
two
years
i
have
argued
for
refiners
at
other
times
but
have
abandoned
them
in
the
last
months
and
have
missed
a
massive
move
my
bad
i
had
seen
the
advantages
of
cheap
shale
oil
and
expensive
crack
spreads
as
a
temporary
one
while
refiners
have
done
a
tremendous
job
in
leveraging
these
advantages
in
export
as
well
and
their
shares
reflect
it
see
the
quarterly
report
for
example
missed
this
opportunity
i
won
t
recommend
them
now
despite
the
likely
opportunity
drop

their
buy
of

tesoro
if
you
had
them
or
have
them
congrats
to
you
if
you
haven
t
had
them
i
can
not
recommend
buying
them
at
this
late
date
in
the
cycle
which
means
they
probably
will
go
