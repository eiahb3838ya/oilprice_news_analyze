the biggest challenge for u.s. oil exports
as
saudi
arabia
and
russia

with
both
the
geopolitics
and
economics
of
continuing
or
stopping

of

and
over
half
of
that
million

will
find
their
way
to
asian
markets
reuters
said
citing
a
key
executive
with
an
oil
exporter
this
follows
a
record
million
bpd
of
oil
that
the
exported
just
two
weeks
oil
exports
into
asia
come
as
the
price
differential
between
global
oil
benchmark
brent
crude
and
benchmark
west
texas
intermediate
widens
that
price
differential
is
currently
around
per
barrel
offering
arbitrage
opportunities
for
producers
and
huge
savings
for
asian
refiners
who
buy
crude
the
discount
between
the
price
of
brent
crude
and
wti
produced
in
the
permian
basin

to
nearly
per

the
the
largest

spread
in

for
an

as
price
differentials
remain
oil
exports
will
continue
to
chip
away
at
both
saudi
and
russian
market
share
in
asia
the
world
s
largest
oil
consuming
region
led
by
china
japan
india
and
south
korea
china
surpassed
the
in
annual
gross
crude
oil
imports
in
importing
million
bpd
compared
with
million
bpd
for
the
according
to
a
report
by
the
energy
information
administration
eia
problem
for
oil
exporters
however
is
that
many
asian
refineries
are
configured
to
process
heavier
crude
blends
and
have
to
use
lighter
sweeter
oil
to
blend
with
other
crude
grades
for
refiners
that
can
process
lighter
crude
the
price
differential
is
a
boon
and
ensures
that
oil
exports
will
continue
to
grab
asian
market
share
yet
the
also
exports
other
grades
like
mars
and
southern
green
canyon
which
are
medium
sour
grades
as
well
as
bryan
mound
and
more
complicated
problem
for
oil
exporters
are
bottle
necks
and
lack
of
pipeline
infrastructure
to
move
crude
to
market
this
is
particularly
acute
in
the
permian
basin
which
has
a
lack
of
pipeline
takeaway
capacity
to
transport
oil
to
houston
or
corpus
christi
where
it
can
be
loaded
on
tankers
for
export
it
s
a
story
of
producers
being
the
victim
of
their
own
success
related
why
oil
exports
are
only
heading
highera
report
earlier
this
month
by
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
dallas
said
that
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
hasn
t
yet
stymied
production
but
that
could
change
later
this
year
or
by
the
middle
of
next
year
if
more
pipelines
are
not
variable
in
the
equation
is
just
how
much
oil
is
the
geared
to
export
moving
from
a
current
average
of
just
over
million
bpd
to
top
off
at
what
some
analysts
claim
could
be
a
maximum
of
capacity
of
to
million
bpd
will
take
more
some
maneuvering
the
problem
with
trying
to
determine
the
exact
export
figure
is
that
most
terminal
operators
and
companies
don
t
disclose
capacity
while
the
doe
doesn
t
keep
track
of
the
demand

and

china
is

to
import
more

the
white

said
last

after
a
round
of
talks
between
american

chinese
trade
both
sides
agreed
on
meaningful

the
united

will
send
a
team
to
china
to
work
out
the
details
and
will
continue
to
engage
at
high
levels
on
these
issues
and
to
seek
to
resolve
their
economic
and
trade
concerns
in
a
proactive
manner
the
statement
added
related
are
we
about
to
see
another
correction
in
oil
prices
the
largest
buyer
of
crude
going
forward
will
be
sinopec
the
largest
oil
refiner
in
the
world
which
operated
million
bpd
of
total
oil
processing
capacity
in

has
considerable
market
share
in

for
selling

moreover
unipec

is
engaged
in
a
war
with
saudi
aramco
over
the
price
increases
of
its
arab

which
lends
more
support
for
crude
exports
into
fact
unipec
has
purchased
around
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
for
loading
in
june

the
biggest
volume
ever
to
be
lifted

arm

said
it
would
raise
its
shipments
from
the
to
china
by
around
percent
to

in
from
around

last

the
report
unipec

said
that
the
increase

was
only
due
to
the

not
due

and

at

both
the
price
arbitrage
between

along
with

from

to
procure
more

will
help
american
oil
exporters
make
incursions
into

though
those
incursions

on
