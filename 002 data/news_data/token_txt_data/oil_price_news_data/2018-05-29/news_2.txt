opec unlikely to open the oil taps in june
opec
probably
won
t
decide
in
june
to
bring
back
more
oil
supply
because
the
cartel
and
its
allies
will
be
watching
the
ongoing
geopolitical
events
that
could
impact
broader
global
growth
david
lennox
resources
analyst
at
fat
prophets
told
cnbc
on
that
russia
and
saudi
arabia
are
considering
increasing
oil
production
to
ease
supply
concerns
and
market
anxiety
sent
oil
prices
plummeting
last
week
ending
monday
at
their
lowest
since
may
of
opec
possibly
discussing
bringing
back
some
production
as
soon
as
the
june
meeting
in
vienna
has
only
grown
in
the
past
few
they
probably
won
t
do
anything
in
june
they
ll
just
stay
pat
at
this
point
of
time
because
there
are
a
lot
of
other
geopolitical
events
going
on
around
the
globe
that
could
have
an
impact
on
broader
global
growth
lennox
told
will
probably
sit
pretty
much
pat
but
they
will
continue
with
the
rhetoric
we
are
watching
very
closely
the
market
and
the
oil
price
the
analyst
noted
referring
to
opec
however
sees
brent
crude
persistently
getting
higher
toward
the
a
barrel
region
the
cartel
perhaps
would
take
some
action
to
bring
more
supply
but
this
won
t
happen
in
would
take
place
in
one
of
the
following
meetings
lennox

prophets

their

a
really
strong

in
the
could
perhaps
make
up
for
some
of
the
possible

lennox

is
currently
focused

demand
factors
with

summer
