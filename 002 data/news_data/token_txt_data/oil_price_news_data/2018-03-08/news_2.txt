many
people
in

are
questioning
not
only
its
capability

to

nisha

while
the
rosneft
deal
is
unlikely
to
be
totally
scrapped
should
the
chinese
government
take
over
control
of

this
could
provide
a

china
and
russia
continue
to
boost
their
oil
relations
the
chinese
government
is
stepping
in
to
rein
in
private

and
possibly
obtain
direct
control
over
private
