why aren’t permian oil producers profitable?
the
wall
street
journal
recently
reported
that
only
five
of
the
top
oil
companies
focused
mostly
on
hydraulic
fracking
generated
more
cash
than
they
spent
in
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
this
continues
a
trend
that
has
been
ongoing
throughout
the
fracking
and
losersthe
article
doesn
t
list
the
cash
flow
picture
for
the
entire
top
nor
did
it
explain
how
it
calculated
cash
flow
but
based
on
the
numbers
they
reported
and
my
own
analysis
it
appears
they
are
defining
cash
flow
as
simply
the
amount
of
cash
generated
from
operations
minus
capital
story
indicated
that
overall
companies
spent
for
every
they
took
in
it
further
noted
that
oasis
petroleum
spent
for
every
it
made
in
cash
while
parsley
energy
spent
almost
for
every
it
made
in
hedging
was
blamed
for
the
underwhelming
cash
flow
the
article
noted
that
many
producers
hedged
oil
prices
at
to
a
barrel
and
were
therefore
unable
to
cash
in
on
the
rally
in
oil
prices
of
course
that
makes
you
wonder
why
a
company
would
hedge
at
a
price
that
they
should
have
known
would
result
in
negative
cash
resources
infamously
ditched
its
hedges
in
after
oil
prices
declined
to
the
company
expected
prices
to
bounce
back
quickly
continental
hasn
t
yet
resumed
hedging
but
expects
to
do
so
at
some
point
notably
continental
was
reported
to
have
the
highest
cash
flow
among
its
peers
at
million
for
eog
resources
was
also
highlighted
for
generating
a
million
cash
surplus
for
the
quarter
related
higher
prices
to
help
oil
companies
refinance
in
debtthe
article
doesn
t
name
the
other
companies
that
generated
positive
cash
flow
but
i
screened
the
data
from
the
s
p
global
market
intelligence
database
and
calculated
it
myself
the
numbers
i
calculated
for
continental
and
eog
matched
the
numbers
reported
in
the
wsj
article
so
i
used
the
same
calculation
for
the
rest
of
the
the
wsj
story
didn
t
include
conocophillips
in
its
analysis
as
it
led
all
oil
companies
considering
just
the
pure
oil
and
gas
producers
with
cash
flow
of
million
for
the
quarter
cop
is
the
largest
pure
oil
and
gas
producer
and
like
continental
they
aren
t
hedged
but
their
oil
and
gas
operations
are
geographically
diverse
and
they
aren
t
purely
a
fracking
companies
generating
positive
cash
flow
among
the
largest
oil
and
gas
producers
by
enterprise
value
excluding
the
supermajor
integrated
companies
were
eqt
at
million
chesapeake
at
million
cabot
oil
gas
at
million
and
cimarex
at
million
the
biggest
overall
cash
flow
loser
in
the
top
was
pioneer
natural
resources
which
outspent
its
cash
flow
by
permian
winnersnotably
despite
the
surge
of
oil
production
in
the
permian
basin
none
of
the
companies
that
generated
positive
cash
flow
in
operate
either
exclusively
or
mostly
within
the
permian
basin
related
is
a
natural
gas
pipeline
between
alaska
and
china
realistic
continental
operates
primarily
in
two
areas
the
bakken
in
north
dakota
and
the
in
oklahoma
eog
has
operations
scattered
across
the
midcontinent
as
well
as
some
international
production
conocophillips
has
a
diverse
production
portfolio
the
others
generating
positive
cash
flow
are
primarily
natural
gas
companies
or
have
a
large
chunk
of
production
outside
of
the
lack
of
cash
flow
among
permian
producers
can
be
partially
attributed
to
logistical
constraints
in
the
permian
that
won
t
likely
be
relieved
until
but
it
s
also
a
function
of
companies
investing
heavily
into
the
permian
in
anticipation
of
future
be
clear
it
isn
t
necessarily
a
concern
if
a
company
occasionally
has
negative
cash
flow
companies
invest
for
the
future
and
if
their
outlook
is
for
higher
oil
prices
then
they
may
invest
significantly
but
this
increases
the
level
of
risk
for
these
companies
as
a
prolonged
oil
price
slump
could
financially
strain
the
big
conclusion
i
will
note
that
most
oil
companies
are
moving
in
the
right
direction
even
if
some
aren
t
doing
so
quickly
enough
my
screen
of
the
top
and
canadian
oil
and
gas
companies
showed
cumulative
cash
flow
from
the
group
at
million
for
a
year
ago
