why u.s. shale may fall short of expectations
the
shale
industry
may
not
grow
as
much
or
at
least
as
fast
as
everyone
thinks
it
will
according
to
a
top
industry
drilling
frenzy
in
west
texas
is
not
only
facing
pipeline
constraints
an
issue
that
is
very
at
this
point
but
also
some
operational
problems
schlumberger
s
ceo
paal
kibsgaard
says
that
the
shale
industry
is
running
into
some
productivity
issues
that
might
mean
that
shale
growth
ends
up
undershooting
many
of
the
heady
growth
t
the
market
consensus
that
the
permian
can
continue
to
provide
million
barrels
per
day
of
annual
production
growth
for
the
foreseeable
future
is
starting
to
be
called
into
question
kibsgaard
said
in
an
earnings
call
with
analysts
pipeline
woes
are
indeed
causing
a
slowdown
in
the
permian
but
this
isn
t
the
only
problem
instead
we
believe
the
main
challenge
in
the
permian
going
forward
is
more
likely
to
be
reservoir
and
well
performance
as
the
rate
of
infield
drilling
continues
to
accelerate
kibsgaard
issue
is
the
density
and
proximity
of
the
zillions
of
shale
wells
drilled
in
places
like
the
eagle
ford
and
the
permian
in
recent
years
the
industry
increased
the
density
of
shale
wells
stacking
them
closer
and
closer
together
one
well
pad
could
host
a
greater
number
of
wells
companies
also
drilled
longer
laterals
used
more
sand
and
more
water
and
the
improved
returns
seemed
more
recently
this
intensification
is
bumping
up
against
their
limits
in
the
eagle
ford
there
is
evidence
to
suggest
that
packing
too
many
wells
too
close
together
actually
reduces
productivity
as
wells
interfere
with
each
other
it
s
a
problem
known
as
well
interference
or
interference
as
each
additional
well
shooting
off
from
a
main
parent
well
adds
productivity
but
only
up
to
a
certain
limit
beyond
that
threshold
additional
wells
start
to
reduce
productivity

august
report
from
rystad
energy
found
that
the
shale
industry
even
started
to
increase
spacing
between
wells
in
the
eagle
ford
evidence
that
drillers
have
already
realized
the
problems
with
crowding
wells
too
close
together
in
the
eagle
ford
the
percentage
of
wells
drilled
less
than
feet
away
from
each
other
steadily
increased
from
through
since
then
these
wells
saw
their
share
of
the
market
drop
in
other
words
since
the
practice
of
packing
wells
close
together
started
to
fade
a
bit
in
the
eagle
those
problems
are
showing
up
in
the
permian
in

the

of

in

has
just
reached
and
we
are
already
starting
to
see
a
similar
reduction
in
unit

productivity
to
that
already
seen
in
the
eagle
ford
suggesting
that
the
permian
growth
potential
could
be
lower
than
earlier
expected
kibsgaard
also
warned
that
a
lot
of
operators
are
pushing
some
of
their
projects
too
hard
in
an
effort
to
squeeze
out
profits
that
helped
drive
efficiencies
in
recent
years
but
those
efforts
are
now
running
up
against
a
wall
since
many
of
the
international
operators
have
focused
on
maximizing
cash
flow
by
producing
their
fields
harder
and
by
prioritizing
actions
at
the
expense
of
the
required
full
cycle
investments
kibsgaard
told
analysts
this
investment
focus
offers
a
finite
set
of
opportunities
over
a
limited
period
of
time
and
this
period
is
now
clearly
coming
to
an
end
as
seen
by
accelerating
decline

coming

now
uncovering
the
underlying
weakness
in
the

kibsgaard
taking
into
account
the
sharp
losses
in
venezuela
and
iran
it
is
clear
that
the
oil
market
could
be
in
for
some
supply
trouble
he
argues
i
our
view
after
years
of
low
activity
the
international
production
base
now
needs
significant
growth
in
investments
for
the
foreseeable

simply
to
