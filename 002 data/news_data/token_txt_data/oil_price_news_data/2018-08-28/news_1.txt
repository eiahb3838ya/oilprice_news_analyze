solving the permian pipeline problem
the
fracking
revolution
in
the
has
considerably
changed
the
global
oil
market
and
the
strategic
calculations
of
market
participants
the
initial
entry
of
shale
oil
producers
caused
a
crash
in
prices
due
to
the
sudden
flooding
of
the
market
in
the
steep
decline
in
prices
led
to
a
landmark
deal
between
the
largest
oil
producers
the
agreement
to
reduce
production
by
million
barrels
per
day
significantly
raised
prices
to
a
more
sustainable
level
to
the
benefit
of
the
world
is
facing
several
risks
that
could
again
significantly
impact
the
price
of
oil
only
this
time
not
a
downward
revision
but
upward
obviously
lower
prices
are
favorable
to
consumers
for
whom
the
sharp
decline
in
was
profitable
however
the
looming
perfect
storm
of
geopolitical
and
technical
problems
threatens
to
destabilize
the
trouble
in
several
regions
has
decreased
supply
the

war
in

president

confrontational
policy
towards
iran

the

of

risks
tightening
the
global
oil
market
even
the
past
shale
producers
have
proven
to
fill
some
of
the
gap
left
by
others
the
relative
efficiency
and
speed
with
which
shale
producers
are
able
to
increase
or
decrease
output
has
made
them
extremely
reactive
to
prices
however
trouble
looms
ahead
as
a
problem
independent
from
oil
production
itself
risks
derailing
some
of
the
prospects
transportation
permian
shale
is
one
of
the
most
productive
areas
globally
with
a
production
of
million
barrels
per
day
to
put
that
into
perspective
it
is
comparable
to
the
average
daily
oil
production
in
the
united
arab
emirates
however
the
inland
position
of
the
production
area
requires
significant
pipeline
infrastructure
to
export
to
international
markets
and
refining
facilities

road
transportation
is
not
an
option
as
it
is
too
expensive
