venezuela sends more crude to the u.s. despite production woes
despite
a
persistent
decline
in
crude
oil
production
venezuela
has
seen
its
exports
of
crude
to
its
biggest
market
the
united
states
climb
since
february
this
year
in
fact
between
february
and
june
venezuelan
oil
exports
to
the
gulf
coast
refineries
increased
by
an
impressive
percent
according
to
customs
data
cited
by
s
p
platts
what
is
happening
it
seems
that
market
logic
is
overriding
other
factors
the
recovery
in
venezuelan
exports
is
confined
to
gulf
coast
refineries
analysts
note
these
are
equipped
to
process
heavier
grades
and
their
choice
of
supplier
is
limited
mexico
s
oil
production
is
stagnating
at
the
moment
despite
ambitious
plans
of
the
new
administration
to
raise
it
from
the
current
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
canada
s
heavy
crude
production
is
growing
but
pipeline
capacity
is
not
so
it
s
difficult
and
costly
to
get
more
heavy
crude
to
gulf
refineries
venezuelan
heavy
is
a
convenient
seems
it
is
a
convenient
alternative
despite
earlier
reports
that
gulf
coast
refiners
have
started
turning
back
cargoes
because
the
quality
of
the
crude
had
fallen
short
of
standard
requirements
or
venezuela
has
gotten
around
to
improving
this
quality
it
has
a
good
reason
to
do
so
the
currently
accounts
for
more
than
percent
of
the
troubled
country
s
oil
production
it
makes
sense
to
take
care
of
such
a
major
market
the
us
is
currently
the
atm
cash
machine
for
venezuela
one
analyst
from
hedgeye
risk
management
told
s
p
platts
this
is
ironic
of
course
given
the
stifling
sanctions
against
venezuela
but
it
nevertheless
remains
a
fact
despite
the
sanctions
and
the
mutual
hostility
the
united
states
is
venezuela
s
biggest
oil
market
bigger
even
than
china
which
is
a
staunch
ally
of
analysts
believe
that
as
production
continues
to
fall
so
will
exports
but
then
again
they
may
not
fall
whatever
happens
to
production
even
the
analysts
expecting
exports
to
fall
as
production
continues
down
recognize
that
there
is
certainly
an
appetite
for
that
crude
in
the
and
that
not
going
to
go
away
as
john
auers
from
turner
mason
company
told

p
the
winners
and
losers
this
earnings
seasonhowever
there
is
also
appetite
for
venezuelan
crude
in
china
and
russia
the
country
s
biggest
financial
supporters
some
analysts
identify
this
as
a
factor
that
could
dent
imports
of
venezuelan
crude
alongside
the
degrading
quality
of
its
crude
venezuela
is
in
deep
debt
to
both
china
and
russia
and
it
is
repaying
this
debt
with
crude
say
analysts
washington
may
decide
to
go
ahead
with
the
blanket
sanctions
for
venezuela
s
oil
industry
that
the
administration
has
been
waving
around
as
a
threat
for
about
a
year
now
the
chance
of
this
happening
is
still
is
concern
about
aggravating
an
already
serious
humanitarian
the
option
is
on
the
table
if
these
sanctions
are
imposed
venezuelan
oil
exports
to
united
states
will
immediately
drop
to
venezuela
s
clients
are
only
refineries
on
the
gulf
the
biggest
buyer
is
pdvsa
s
own
subsidiary
blow
to
refining
will
be
limited
even
so
the
fact
that
these
sanctions
have
not
been
implemented
yet
suggests
it
is
not
a
blow
that
washington
is
willing
to
deal
to
gulf
coast
refiners
so
pdvsa
will
continue
to
have
a
market
for
around
half
of
its
falling
production

the
time
