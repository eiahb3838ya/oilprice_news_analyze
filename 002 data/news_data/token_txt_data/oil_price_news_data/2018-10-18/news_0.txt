the oil keeps flowing: iran evades u.s. sanctions
sanctions
on
iran
take
effect
in
a
little
over
two
weeks
and
the
trump
administration
has
already
had
quite
a
bit
of
success
in
knocking
iranian
supply
offline
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
very
far
from
its
goal
of
cutting
iranian
oil
exports
to
zero
as
it
has
international
energy
agency
estimates
that
iran
s
oil
exports
fell
to
million
barrels
per
day
in
september
down
bpd
from
a
recent
peak
in
april
at
the
losses
are
expected
to
continue
but
few
analysts
really
believe
the
trump
administration
will
manage
to
cut
iran
s
exports
to
to
reuters
an
unprecedented
volume
of
iranian
crude
oil
is
set
to
arrive
at
china
s
northeast
dalian
port
this
month
and
in
early
november
before
sanctions
on
iran
take
an
estimated
million
barrels
are
destined
to
flow
from
iran
to
china
over
the
next
few
weeks
up
from
the
usual
to
million
barrels
each
data
from
the
iea
backs
up
this
trend
iran
has
been
storing
a
portion
of
its
oil
production
on
ships
in
the
persian
gulf
a
practice
that
it
resorted
to
during
the
previous
period
of
international
sanctions
between
and
it
is
difficult
to
simply
turn
off
oil
production
and
with
onshore
storage
filling
up
iran
has
been
forced
to
store
oil
at
sea
however
while
iran
s
floating
storage
spiked
in
september
it
actually
fell
back
in
october
as
several
cargoes
set
sail
for
china
and
india
data
from
kpler
showed
the
iea
wrote
in
its
report
the
surge
in
shipments
demonstrates
iran
s
determination
to
keep
its
oil
flowing
as
our
leaders
have
said
it
will
be
impossible
to
stop
iran
from
selling
its
oil
we
have
various
ways
of
selling
our
oil
and
when
the
tankers
reach
dalian
we
will
decide
whether
to
sell
it
to
other
buyers
or
to
china

from
the
national
iranian
tanker
company

reuters
related
is
uranium
on
the
way
back
meanwhile
there
is
other
evidence
to
suggest
that
iran
is
succeeding
in
shipping
much
more
oil
than
is
officially
reported
nitc
tankers
have
shut
off
their
tracking
devices
in
order
to
keep
up
oil
shipments
in
the
dark
some
satellite
data
suggests
that
a
greater
number
of
tankers
are
heading
to
india
that
is
thought
to
be
the
case
the
iea
said
in
its
october
oil
market
report
that
india
s
purchases
from
iran
jumped
from
bpd
in
august
to
bpd
in
furtive
shipments

the
limits
of
power
discounts
shipments
bartering
and
other
clandestine
maneuvers
should
keep
some
iranian
oil
flowing
even
after
november
for
instance
iran
has
discounted
its
oil
by
the
most
in
years
according
to
bloomberg
making
it
hard
to
pass
up
for
iran
s
oil
exports
have
indeed
suffered
a
significant
blow
from
the
looming
sanctions
china
s
imports
from
iran
fell
to
bpd
in
september
the
lowest
amount
since
sinopec
s
trading
unit
unipec
has
said
that
it
slashed
the
amount
of
oil
it
is
buying
from
iran
because
of
pressure
from
the
united
states
europe
purchased
bpd
in
total
in
september
down
bpd
from
the
second
quarter
these
volumes
in
particular
are
likely
most
at
risk
as
european
companies
are
much
more
intertwined
with
the
united
states
and
as
such
are
vulnerable

american
sanctions

exports
to
zero
and
has
maintained
that
any
waivers
would
be
few
and
far
between
as
national
security
advisor
john
bolton
put
it
however
the
is
also
in
talks
about
waivers
with
countries
that
depend
on
iranian
oil
such
as
turkey
and
india
the
trump
administration
is
in
somewhat
of
a
bind
as
cutting
iran
s
oil
exports
by
too
much
will
drive
up
crude
oil
prices
which
could
be
a
political
liability
at
flip
side
of
this
is
the
possibility
of
a
release
from
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
spr
in
fact
it
is
somewhat
surprising
that
this
has
not
already
happened
the
loss
of
supply
from
iran
and
the
sudden
tightness
in
the
market
would
offer
some
justification
for
an

global
spr
release
is
a
affair
and
many
analysts
and
even
the
secretary
of
energy
rick
perry
have
said
that
it
would
do
very
little
to
ease
a
supply
shortage
however
it
would
have
a
significant
psychological
impact
on
the
market
suppressing
prices
in
the
short
run
while
also
giving
the

administration
more
leeway
to
take
a
harder

is
going
to
have
to
swallow
some
bit
of
cheating
because
iran
s
oil
exports
are
unlikely
to
fall
to
zero

the
next
few
