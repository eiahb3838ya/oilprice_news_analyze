china can’t get enough of the world’s cheapest crude
canada
s
oil
industry
woes
have
been
a
topic
of
discussion
in
the
media
for
some
time
now
what
with
the
persistent
delays
in
the
trans
mountain
expansion
unyielding
opposition
to
anything
that
involves
pipelines
and
the
growing
crude
production
from
the
oil
sands
the
latest
news
however
is
good
news
chinese
refiners
are
buying
growing
amounts
of
canadian
crude
taking
advantage
of
a
substantial
discount
in
its
price
to
the
benchmark
brought
about
by
the
above
combination
of
this
month
bloomberg
reported
chinese
refiners
were
buying
canadian
heavy
that
was
trading
at
a
discount
of
as
much
as
us
to
west
texas
intermediate
in
a
context
of
rising
but
canadian
crude
discount
is
more
than
a
good
bargain
it
s
an
excellent
bargain
especially
for
refiners
who
have
just
completed
summer
maintenance
and
plan
to
increase
their
imports
on
higher
local
fuel
purchased
million
barrels
of
heavy
canadian
crude
oil
for
loading
in
september
up
by
nearly
percent
compared
to
the
million
barrels
it
imported
from
canada
in
april
bloomberg
said
last
week
quoting
data
by
and
intelligence
company
kpler
these
imports
are
seen
to
continue
rising
this
month
as
well
amid
the
height
of
construction
season
ahead
of
winter
in
week
s
p
global
platts
reported
that
chinese
companies
had
bought
three
cargoes
of
canadian
heavy
crude
to
load
in
vancouver
in
november
more
will
follow
the
huge
discount
of
western
canadian
select
to
wti
is
not
the
only
reason
for
this
shift
the
other
reason
has
to
do
with
supply
china
s
two
other
main
sources
of
heavy
and
both
going
through
a
production
decline
albeit
for
different
reasons
related

dark
horse
of
the
oil

the
venezuela
situation
is
clear
and

australian
heavy
crude
production
has
been
on
the
decline
due
to
natural
depletion

p
global
platts
notes
in
fact
woodside

operator
of
the

produces
one
of
its
benchmark
heavy
grades
enfield
plans
to
stop
pumping
oil
at
the
field
by
the
end
of
this
there
is
also
the
seasonal
factor
of
construction
chinese
refiners
use
a
lot
of
the
heavy
crude
they
import
for
the
production
of
asphalt
to
be
used
in
road
construction
under
beijing
s
infrastructure
plans
but
even
after
this
seasonal
high
chances
are
chinese
refiners
state
and
teapots
alike
will
continue
to
take
advantage
of
the
low
price
of
canadian
are
no
signs
that
the
pipeline
situation
in
canada
will
change
anytime
soon
there
are
also
no
signs
that
production
growth
will
begin
to
slow
canadian
producers
are
pretty
much
in
the
same
position
as
their
counterparts
with
the
exception
of
the
difference
in
prices
they
need
to
pump
more
because
they
have
debts
to
repay
and
businesses
to
keep
chinese
entrance
into
canada
heavy
crude
is
the
silver
lining
of
canada
s
oil
problems
if
it
weren
t
for
the
hefty
discount
to
wti
the
shipping
costs
would
have
remained
too
high
to
be
attractive
for
chinese
refiners
