goldman warns of oil market surplus next year
the
oil
market
could
swing
into
a
surplus
in
early
as
spare
capacity
is
deployed
goldman
sachs
said
in
a
note
to
clients
cited
by
reuters
the
investment
bank
s
warning
might
not
have
an
immediate
effect
on
prices
as
traders
are
at
the
moment
too
preoccupied
with
the
worry
that
opec
s
spare
capacity
is
at
a
historic
low
but
once
it
sinks
in
prices
could
reverse
their
while
upside
price
risks
will
prevail
for
now
fundamental
data
outside
of
iran
has
not
turned
bullish
in
our
view
the
investment
bank
s
analysts
said
in
the
note
we
expect
fundamentals
to
gradually
become
binding
by
early
as
new
spare
capacity
comes
goldman
s
analysts
said
production
in
libya
and
nigeria
was
higher
than
expected
by
bpd
and
coupled
with
saudi
arabia
s
production
and
the
political
stabilization
of
iraq
which
improved
prospects
for
higher
output
from
kurdistan
it
could
provide
a
supply
buffer
for
the
final
quarter
of
the
year
essentially
reducing
the
supply
worry
stemming
from
the
upcoming
iran
bank
still
expects
million
bpd
loss
in
iranian
supply
although
others
put
the
loss
higher
at
million
bpd
and
others
are
skeptical
about
the
sanctions
cutting
iranian
supply
by
even
million
bpd
but
until
the
shipping
data
for
november
starts
flowing
it
s
anyone
s
guess
in
fact
even
then
it
would
be
guesswork
as
iranian
tankers
are
already
switching
off
their
tracking

as
they
head
out
from
the
export
has
been
bullish
on

for
most
of
this
said
in
that
it
continues
to
expect
that
brent
crude
prices
could
retest
the
a
barrel
threshold
this
year
but
probably
only
late
in
not
this
summer
as
uncertainties
mount
over
the
timing
and
magnitude
of
global
supply
disruptions
the
bank
turned
out
right
and
before

expected
it
as
the

excessive
emotionality
