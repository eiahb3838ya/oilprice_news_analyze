iea: plastics will replace fuels as key oil demand driver
plastics
will
displace
fuels
as
the
main
driver
for
crude
oil
demand
the
international
energy
agency
said
today
adding
that
petrochemicals
will
come
to
account
for
more
than
percent
of
oil
demand
growth
globally
in
the
period
to
by
they
will
drive
half
of
the
global
oil
demand
growth
raising
this
demand
by
million
bpd
by
that
report
that
contains
the
projection
is
titled
the
future
of
petrochemicals
and
the
iea
said
it
was
part
of
a
series
of
reports
that
aim
to
uncover
blind
spots
or
facets
of
the
global
energy
industry
that
receive
less
attention
than
they
are
indeed
big
oil
s
big
hope
for
the
the
more
distant
future
petrochemicals
are
used
in
thousands
of
products
with
the
biggest
group
among
these
being
plastic
products
the
bad
news
for
oil
is
that
green
initiatives
around
the
world
are
mounting
and
many
of
them
are
targeting
precisely
this
group
of
products
and
yet
even
if
plastic
products
are
removed
from
the
supply
chain
enough
demand
will
remain
to
drive
the
consumption
of
crude
petrochemicals
are
one
of
the
key
blind
spots
in
the
global
energy
debate
especially
given
the
influence
they
will
exert
on
future

trends
iea

fatih
birol
said
petrochemicals
are
not
just
the
plastics
we
see
in
grocery
bags
petrochemical
products
are
also
essential
in
renewable
energy
installations
such
as
solar
panels
and
wind
turbines
but
also
batteries
and
thermal
insulation
and
thousands
of
other
products
and
durability
of
petrochemicals
demand
is
evident
in
the
demand
growth
trends
the
iea
says
demand
for
plastics
has
almost
doubled
over
the
last
years
exceeding
the
demand
growth
rate
of
every
other
bulk
material
including
steel
aluminum
and
cement
perhaps
more
importantly
emerging
markets
have
yet
to
catch
up
to
developed
ones
in
their
plastics
consumption
now
that

for
steady
