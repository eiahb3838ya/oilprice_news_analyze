u.s. shale companies are ready to expand
the
latest
oil
rally
which
sees
crude
trading
at
close
to
its
highest
point
in
three
years
is
sufficient
to
garner
considerable
attention
from
market
pundits
industry
insiders
and
investors
alike
it
has
raised
the
ugly
specter
of
a
sharp
uptick
in
oil
production
driven
by
the
shale
oil
boom
yet
there
are
signs
that
the
potential
for
shale
oil
companies
to
rapidly
expand
production
and
return
to
the
boom
years
witnessed
before
the
prolonged
oil
slump
appears
are
a
range
of
constraints
poised
to
prevent
the
rapid
production
growth
many
mainstream
analysts
had
been
was
only
in
early
december
last
year
that
an
mit
study
was
released
concluding
that
the
vastly
overstates
oil
production
forecasts
and
that
the
eia
has
been
exaggerating
the
effect
of
fracking
technology
on
well
to
mit
research
the
eia
assumes
that
regular
improvements
in
drilling
technology
and
well
design
are
boosting
output
at
new
wells
by
around
percent
yet
their
own
research
shows
that
it
is
closer
to
percent
that
along
with
the
eia
s
own
monthly
production
data
which
shows
that
oil
output
between
january
and
november
grew
at
a
far
more
modest
monthly
average
of
percent
indicates
that
the
eia
s
weekly
forecasts
could
very
well
be
overstating
oil
the
past
the
optimistic
figures
provided
by
the
eia
have
suppressed
the
price
of
west
texas
intermediate
or
wti
and
this
in
part
has
been
one
of
the
contributing
factors
to
the
significant
premium
that
has
existed
between
wti
and
brent
related
the
oil
bubble
has
burst
what
now
nevertheless
that
premium
is
closing
having
fallen
from
over
per
barrel
at
the
start
of
to
less
than
for
the
last
week
of
january
amid
falling
analysts
think
this
could
lead
to
a
reduction
in
demand
for
oil
exports
which
would
reduce
the
incentive
for
shale
oil
producers
to
ramp
up
that
shale
oil
possesses
exceptionally
low
breakeven
costs
which
coupled
with
wti
trading
at
over
per
barrel
will
spark
a
massive
surge
in
activity
appear
overstated
while
it
s
true
that
considerable
improvements
in
technology
and
drilling
techniques
have
caused
costs
to
fall
they
aren
t
as
low
as
many
analysts
late
reuters
reported
that
an
analysis
of
second
quarter
financial
results
revealed
that
breakeven
costs
were
per
barrel
well
above
the
sub
prices
claimed
by
rystad
energy
in
breakeven
costs
are
different
from
company
to
company
as
well
as
shale
formation
to
shale
formation
making
them
unreliable
indicators
on
which
to
solely
base
production
growth
claims
that
shale
oil
companies
intend
to
significantly
boost
production
with
wti
trading
at
over
a
barrel
there
are
growing
signs
of
line
unconventional
oil
producers
have
yet
to
demonstrate
that
they
can
consistently
make
to
oil
industry
consultancy
wood
mackenzie
that
won
t
occur
until
wti
is
routinely
trading
at
per
barrel
which
they
believe
is
unlikely
until
related
oil
prices
tank
as
drillers
add
massive
number
of
rigsthere
s
also
considerable
pressure
being
applied
to
shale
oil
companies
by
institutional
investors
to
exercise
restraint
and
avoid
the
excesses
of
the
shale
oil
boom
excesses
of
the
shale
oil
boom
and
the
sharp
decline
of
oil
prices
were
also
subjected
to
by
shareholders
and
institutional
investors
that
has
seen
industry
leaders
promise
far
greater
restraint
and
to
take
a
disciplined
approach
to
the
deployment
of
capital
as
well
as
drilling
in
an
attempt
to
reduce
debt
and
generate
returns
for
they
follow
through
on
their
promises
which
according
to
goldman
sachs
is
highly
likely
it
s
another
factor
that
reduces
the
likelihood
of
any
substantial
uptick
in
oil
production
factor
that
many
analysts
who
believe
that
shale
could
come
roaring
back
is
that
oilfield
services
are
becoming
quite
constrained
when
this
is
considered
in
conjunction
with
rising
costs
and
growing
labor
shortages
not
only
will
it
slow
down
any
rapid
expansion
of
shale
oil
production
but
it
will
trigger
an
increase
in
breakeven
costs
making
it
less
attractive

believes
that
a
lack
of
capacity
in
the

services
industry
will
act
as
a
constraint
on

he
went
on
to
state
the

is
pretty
well
and
is
not
rapidly
gaining
while
some
analysts
believe
that
higher
prices
will
lead
a
surge
in

there
are
several
factors
that
could
prevent

from
rapidly
expanding

threatening
