the race is on: big oil rushes to supply the 1 billion disconnected
supermajors
are
taking
on
more
renewable
energy
commitments
lately
as
they
prepare
for
a
less
future
some
of
them
are
going
a
step
further
coupling
these
green
commitments
with
humanist
causes
such
as
providing
access
to
energy
to
part
of
the
one
billion
people
all
over
the
world
who
have
no
for
all
director

reviewed
in
a
recent
story
this
push
that
will
see
shell
total
french
engie
schneider
electric
and
others
of
their
caliber
build
electricity
supply
from
clean
sources
for
million
of
this
one
billion
within
the
next
ten
years
shell
is
the
most
ambitious
aiming
to
provide
access
to
electricity
for
million
and
total
plans
to
provide
million
people
in
africa
with
solar
energy
derived
power
within
the
next
two
are
also
catching
up
with
the
green
agenda
exxon
recently
announced
it
had
inked
a
deal
with
danish
renewable
energy
company
orsted
to
buy
mw
of
electricity
produced
by
solar
and
wind
farms
to
power
its
oil
production
in
the
permian
the
deal
reflects
falling
renewable
energy
prices
which
is
making
renewable
energy
a
lot
more
competitive
with
fossil
fuels
not
to
mention
the
reputational
effect
its
deployment
would
have
on
big
oil
and
big
oil
is
in
serious
need
of
news
that
is
good
for
its
reputation
even
with
a
redoubling
of
efforts
to
move
more
quickly
into
renewable
energy
territory
challenges
remain
and
bp
for
instance
are
being
pressured
by
activist
shareholders
into
doing
more
to
lower
their
carbon
footprint
one
such
activist
shareholder
dutch
group
follow
this
has
been
actively
pressuring
the
companies
it
holds
shares
in

whose
sole

for

is
to
apply
the
abovementioned
pressure
are
a
case
in

a

bloomberg
report
said
follow

move
its

commitments
undertaken
by
more
than
a
hundred
has
been
follow
this
s
first
target
and
the
resolutions
although
invariably
beaten
down
by
other
shareholders
have
had
an
impact
and
shell
has
clearly
undertaken
more
commitments
in
the
cleaner
energy
transition
follow
this
is
not
stopping
with
shell
its
resolutions
have
been
garnering
growing
support
despite
their
failure
at
the
shareholder
votes
and
the
group
is
now
setting
its
sights
on
other
sector
players
bp
is
facing
a
resolution
of
its
own
with
the
same
call
to
action
and
according
to
the
group
chevron
and
exxon
may
also
join
shell

bp
in

no
other
shareholder
beats
follow
this
to
the
resolution
tabling
big
oil
is
doing
more
but
it
s
nowhere
near
enough
and
the
latest
climate
talks
in
poland
suggests
pressure
will
continue
increasing
on
the
industry
governments
met
in
poland
to
devise
a
rulebook
for
implementing
paris
agreement
commitments
but
doing
this
has
turned
out
to
be
trickier
than
maybe
some
expected
as
per
a
bbc
report
on
the
topic
there
are
too
many
factors
to
contend
with
while
deciding
on
the
best
way
to
arrest
the
warming
of
the
atmosphere
yet
one
thing
is
certain
fossil
fuel
producers
will
continue
to
be
in
the
focus
of
attention
as
the
biggest
culprits
behind
climate
change
whatever
they
do
to
move
into
renewables
and
cut
their
carbon
footprint
after
all
whatever
they
do
until
the
world
