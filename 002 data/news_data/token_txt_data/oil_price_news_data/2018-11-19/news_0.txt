this diplomatic breakthrough could slam oil prices
iraq
is
set
to
bring
long
disrupted
oil
back
online
adding
fresh
barrels
to
a
market
already
weighed
down
by
ample
supplies
across
the
little
over
a
year
ago
kurdistan
held
a
referendum
on
independence
from
iraq
which
passed
with
overwhelming
support
the
vote
was
but
was
meant
to
lay
down
a
marker
and
increase
leverage
in
negotiations
with
baghdad
over
the
region
s
eventual
gambit
backfired
however
as
the
iraqi
government
sent
in
troops
to
seize
parts
of
kirkuk
and
its
surrounding
oil
fields
the
events
led
to
the
disruption
of
the
kirkuk
oil
fields
temporarily
knocking
some
bpd
seizure
of
the
kirkuk
oil
fields
also
put
an
end
to
kurdistan
s
bid
for
independence
but
the
issue
over
who
controls
the
oil
fields
and
how
it
should
be
exported
has
been
bogged
down
since
last
year
kurdistan
controls
the
only
functional
pipeline
out
of
the
country
which
runs
north
to
week
baghdad
and
erbil
reached
an
agreement
to
allow
more
oil
to
flow
the
tentative
agreement
has
reportedly
led
to
the
resumption
of
to
bpd
last
year
the
kirkuk
fields
exported
bpd
according
to
reuters
and
at
this
point
it
is
not
clear
if
more
increases
are
in
the
offing
there
are
still
major
issues
that
need
to
be
resolved
including
the
longstanding
fight
over
whether
or
not
kurdistan
should
receive
oil
revenues
directly
or
via
budgetary
transfers
from
united
states
was
highly
interested
in
pushing
erbil
and
baghdad
to
resolve
their
differences
the
trump
administration
has
been
trying
to
slash
iran
s
oil
exports
for
much
of
this
year
and
integral
to
that
campaign
has
been
an
effort
to
find
supplies
elsewhere
most
notably
president
trump
himself
has
repeatedly
pressed
opec
to
boost
production
via
a
series
of
angry
tweets
more
methodically
however
diplomats
pressed
the
saudis
to
increase
production
related
new
quotas
could
trigger
ev
breakthrough
in
chinathat
effort
succeeded
saudi
arabia
boosted
production
by
bpd
in
october
compared
to
may
levels
when
iran
sanctions
were
announced
to
be
sure
however
saudi
arabia
is
reportedly
upset
about
the
degree
to
which
the
trump
administration
offered
waivers
feeling
duped
after
they
agreed
to
increase
also
scoured
other
parts
of
the
middle
east
for
extra
barrels
earlier
this
month
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
american
diplomats
were
urging
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
to
resolve
their
territorial
disputes
over
the
neutral
zone
oil
fields
the
fields
have
been
offline
for
several
years
and
have
a
capacity
of
around
bpd
the
logic
was
obvious
if
the
saudis
and
kuwaitis
could
overcome
their
outstanding
differences
half
a
million
barrels
per
day
could
flow
from
those
fields
essentially
allowing
the
to
step
up
the
pressure
campaign
on
iran
if
that
had
worked
the
would
not
have
needed
to
grant
waivers
to
so
many
countries
importing
iranian
oil
that
effort
failed
after
talks
broke
kirkuk
has
also
been
a
high
priority
for
the
trump
administration
the
wsj
reported
a
few
weeks
ago
that
american
diplomats
were
enticing
the
iraqis
with
the
possibility
of
an
exemption
on
sanctions
related
to
other
areas
of
business
with
iran
for
instance
iraq
imports
natural
gas
for
electricity
generation
from
iran
but
because
banks
have
been
wary
about
engaging
in
this
business
iraq
has
had
trouble
paying
for
the
gas
state
department
spokeswoman
heather
nauert
said
on
twitter
last
friday
that
the
ramp
up
of
oil
output
from
kirkuk
was
a
positive
development
for
iraq
and
another
important
step
in
our
efforts
to
reduce
iran
s
oil
related
why
the
eu
ca
save
irandespite
the
new
oil
from
kirkuk
it
may
not
matter
much
at
the
global
level
the
resumption
of
kirkuk
shipments
of
between
and
barrels
per
day
will
not
add
to
iraq
s
total
exports
a
spokesman
for
iraq
s
oil
minister
told
reuters
instead
the
oil
might
be
consumed
domestically
in
the
volumes
may
remain
low
until
there
is
a
comprehensive
agreement
with
all
sides
shwan
zulal
of
carduci
consulting
told
the
ft
the
ft
had
reported
last
week
that
the
two
sides
were
nearing
a
deal
resumption
has
only
been
possible
due
to
relentless
pressure
from
the
us
on
baghdad
so
they
are
giving
trump
oil
prices
barely
budged
and
in
fact
reuters
noted
that
brent
rose
per
barrel
after
the
news
broke
perhaps
because
the
market
had
already
factored
in
higher
oil
flows
than
the
to
bpd
more
oil
could
be
forthcoming
but
for
now
the
diplomatic
breakthrough
will
be
a
relatively
minor
affair
for
the
global
oil
