is opec’s mission ‘’accomplished’’?
opec
s
goal
of
draining
the
global
inventory
surplus
has
finally
been
international
energy
agency
said
in
its
latest
oil
market
report
that
the
supply
overhang
has
pretty
much
vanished
thanks
to
opec
s
efforts
at
limiting
production
it
is
not
for
us
to
declare
on
behalf
of
the
vienna
agreement
countries
that
it
is
mission
accomplished
but
if
our
outlook
is
accurate
it
certainly
looks
very
much
like
it
the
energy
agency
fundamentals
are
on
a
similar
track
compared
to
last
month
s
report
the
iea
kept
its
oil
demand
forecast
at
million
barrels
per
day
although
it
noted
that
the
on
trade
tariffs
between
the
and
china
puts
the
demand
outlook
at
risk
for
example
a
percent
decline
in
global
gdp
growth
would
result
in
a
reduction
in
demand
growth
by
bpd
oil
demand
would
suffer
the
direct
impact
of
lower
bunker
consumption
and
lower
inland
transportation
of
traded
goods
reducing
fuel
oil
and
diesel
use
the
iea
said
still
the
negative
effects
of
a
trade
war
remain
to
be
supply
picture
also
looks
about
the
same
with
growth
expected
to
hit
a
soaring
this
year
underpinned
by
a
staggering
growth
rate
from
the
however
the
iea
said
that
its
supply
forecast
is
also
vulnerable
to
some
new
potential
risks
the
pipeline
bottleneck
emerging
in
the
permian
basin
could
slow
the
rate
of
growth
of
shale
supply
t
here
is
concern
about
bottlenecks
in
takeaway
capacity
that
have
seen
recent
discounts
for
wti
midland
versus
houston
widen
to
a
record
at
nearly
this
issue
applies
in
canada
as
well
as
in
the
us
the
iea
said
related
goldman
sachs
the
bullish
case
for
oilthe
flip
side
of
that
is
the
unexpected
production
declines
from
opec
the
iea
said
that
taken
together
some
bpd
of
supply
has
been
sidelined
dramatically
bolstering
the
impact
of
the
cuts
to
all
intents
and
purposes
more
than
a
second
saudi
arabia
has
been
added
to
the
output
agreement
the
agency
declines
from
venezuela
in
particular
are
accentuating
the
agreement
helping
to
put
opec
s
compliance
rate
at
percent
in
agreement
is
succeeding
in
balancing
the
oil
market
with
just
under
half
of
global
oil
supply
subject
to
restraint
and
oil
demand
growing
steadily
the
impact
on
stocks
has
been
substantial
the
iea
inventories
have
plunged
with
the
surplus
in
the
oecd
falling
to
just
million
barrels
above
the
average
at
the
same
time
refined
product
stocks
are
actually
below
the
average
the
iea
says
that
if
output
remains
constant
and
the
demand
forecast
lives
up
to
expectations
the
market
could
see
inventories
decline
at
a
pace
for
the
rest
of
the
data
on
inventories
is
not
perfect
oecd
numbers
are
published
on
a
lag
providing
the
market
only
with
a
retrospective
look
at
the
state
of
play
also
the
inventory
data
in
the
at
this
point
accounts
for
the
bulk
of
demand
growth
is
notoriously
opaque
which
makes
sweeping
conclusions
about
the
oil
market
those
caveats
in
mind
the
iea
said
the
market
rebalancing
effort
may
have
arrived
with
markets
expected
to
tighten
it
is
possible
that
when
we
publish
oecd
stocks
data
in
the
next
month
or
two
they
will
have
reached
or
even
fallen
below
the
average
related
are
oil
markets
tightening
too
fast
against
that
backdrop
the
reassertion
of
geopolitical
uncertainty
is
now
heavily
influential
as
we
write
uncertainty
about
the
next
steps
in
syria
and
yemen
have
helped
propel
the
price
of
brent
crude
oil
back
above
even
as
opec
has
apparently
achieved
its
goal
of
draining
surplus
stocks
the
group
seems
set
on
keeping
the
cuts
in
place
through
the
rest
of
this
year
that
likely
means
it
will
formulate
new
criteria
to
justify
ongoing
cuts
opec
is
within
rapid
reach
of
its
first
announced
goals
and
will
have
to
come
up
with
a
new
metric
for
the
june
meeting
if
it
wants
the
agreement
to
last
into
the
second
half
of
the
year
