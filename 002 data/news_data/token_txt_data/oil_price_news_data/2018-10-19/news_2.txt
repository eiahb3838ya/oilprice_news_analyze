oilfield service companies bet on full recovery
growing
permian
drilling
and
production
started
lifting
last
year
the
revenues
and
profits
of
the
world
s
top
oilfield
service
providers
who
were
badly
bruised
by
the
oil
price
halliburton
and
baker
hughes
saw
their
earnings
in
the
past
few
quarters
lifted
by
the
return
of
frenzied
drilling
in
north
america
led
by
the
permian
basin
while
international
operations
lagged
amid
slower
recovery
in
global
investments
in
exploration
and
july
this
year
the
mood
at
schlumberger
and
baker
hughes
in
earnings
was
an
upbeat
outlook
for
the
immediate
future
with
signs
that
the
international
market
outside
the
was
also
on
the
road
to
the
top
oilfield
service
providers
started
warning
in
september
that
the
permian
constraints
would
temporarily
slow
down
activity
in
the
shale
for
all
three
of
them
the
international
business
looks
increasingly
positive
as
global
spending
on
exploration
and
production
is
beginning
to
recover
rising
this
the
first
time
since
expect
all
three
top
oilfield
service
companies
to
report
higher
earnings
for
the
third
quarter
compared
to
last
year
but
they
have
been
cutting
their
projections
in
recent
weeks
due
to
the
takeaway
capacity
constraints
in
the
permian
expected
to
reduce
drilling
in
north
america
lack
of
additional
pipeline
capacity
in
the
permian
basin
is
becoming
an
increasing
constraint
to
production
growth
schlumberger
chairman
and
ceo
paal
kibsgaard
said
as
early
as
in
july
on
the
earnings
release
related
what
killed
the
oil
price
rally
in
september
kibsgaard
said
at
the
barclays
ceo
conference
that
the
market
consensus
that
the
permian
would
continue
to
provide
million
bpd
of
annual
production
growth
for
the
foreseeable
future
is
now
starting
to
be
called
into
in
fact
so
far
in
the
third
quarter
the
hydraulic
fracturing
market
has
already
softened
significantly
more
than
we
expected
in
spite
of
the
overall
rig
count
holding
up
relatively
well
schlumberger
s
head
said
but
added
that
international
e
p
spending
has
been
picking
up
pace
in
the
second
half
of
the
the
same
conference
in
early
september
jeff
miller
ceo
at
the
leader
on
the
fracking
market
halliburton
said
that
in
order
to
overcome
takeaway
constraints
in
the
permian
some
operators
will
capital
to
other
basins
some
will
slowdown
other
will
build
as
early
as
in
earnings
halliburton
had
warned
about
a
downturn
in
activity
in
north
america
due
to
budget
constraints
and
takeaway
there
has
been
and
it
s
more
than
we
expected
miller
said
last
month
adding
that
weakness
in
pricing
in
several
basins
plus
project
delays
in
the
middle
east
would
impact
halliburton
s
earnings
by
between
to
per
international
markets
are
recovering
and
this
is
where
the
top
three
oilfield
service
providers
would
look
for
more
drilling
and
hughes
ceo
lorenzo
simonelli
said
at
the
september
barclays
conference
that
global
e
p
spending
is
expected
to
grow
at
a
healthy
pace
over
the
next
three
to
four
oil
s
billion
black
market
we
are
also
seeing
the
beginnings
of
a
recovery
in
the
international
markets
we
re
expecting
offshore
activity
to
see
a
healthy
rebound
as
well
it
will
likely
remain
significantly
below
peak
levels
but
at
the
same
time
we
see
improving
activity
and
importantly
more
stability
as
we
look
into
the
next
few
years
simonelli
baker
hughes
and
halliburton
see
the
north
sea
and
the
middle
east
as
the
key
growth
areas
internationally
although
halliburton
s
miller
warned
in
july
that
how
much
improvement
and
how
quickly
it
comes
will
depend
in
large
part
upon
commodity
prices
and
equipment
higher
oil
prices
and
lowered
development
and
project
costs
have
led
to
cautious
optimism
and
measured
within
the
industry
that
is
set
to
see
an
uptick
in
global
oil
investment
this
year
energy
consultants
wood
mackenzie
energy
expected
in
may
that
new
offshore
projects
are
likely
to
be
sanctioned
this
year
compared
to
just
projects
in
and
fewer
than
in
world
s
top
oilfield
service
providers
will
be
betting
on
international
e
p
spending
recovery
while
they
are
waiting
for
the
permian
constraints
to
abate
probably
sometime
at
the
end
of
the
current
permian
takeaway
constraints
in
north
america
should
be
addressed
within
the
next
to
months
a
series
of
and
challenges
is
emerging
in
the
us
shale
basins
that
could
dampen
the
most
optimistic
production
growth
projections
