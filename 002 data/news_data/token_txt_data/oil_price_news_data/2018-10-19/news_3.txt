brazilâ€™s offshore boom is facing the same problem as u.s. shale

productionbrazil
and
petrobras
show
something
in
common
with
lto
even
with
a
lot
of
debt
and
desire
and
a
strong
resource
base
it
is
difficult
to
raise
production
in
the
face
of
high
decline
rates
it
may
also
be
a
lesson
for
the
world
as
oil
prices
rise
and
activity
picks
up
it
is
by
far
the
most
active
conventional
oil
region
with
many
major
projects
at
various
stages
of
completion
but
facing
delays
and
schedule
crowding
so
oil
production
has
continued
a
slow
decline
contrary
to
expectations
from
last
year
in
july
new
production
again
did
not
quite
match
overall
decline
mostly
because
of
delays
in
of
fpsos
planned
for
this
year
and
at
kbpd
was
down

two

and

an

both

other

started
up

and
fpso

on
the
tartaruga
verde
field
in

also
at
kbpd
there
were
three
other
fpsos
due
for
the
buzios
field
and
but
at
least
one
is
delayed
till
next
year
there
are
now
four
planned
fpsos
remaining
to
be
started
up
this
year
all
in
the
fourth
quarter
and
plus
lula

and
lula
extremo
sul
in
the
lula
field
each
kbpd
nameplate
even
for
a
company
the
size
of
petrobras
that
seems
a
very
tight
schedule
for
commissioning
large
complex
plant
so
one
or
two
may
slip
to
next
year
and
all
may
be
so
late
as
to
make
little
difference
to
this
year
s
numbers
see
reuters
for
more
next
year
there
may
be
problems
with
shortage
of
deep
water
drilling
rigs
petrobras
cancelled
some
following
the
price
crash
and
there
have
been
reports
of
them
looking
for
available
rigs
now
no

no

no

no

the

offshore
rig
numbers
by
baker
hughes
have
averaged
around
ten
over
the
last
couple
of
years
unless
they
add
numbers
then
the
overall
will
remain
as
it
has
been
and
production
will
stay
about
berbigao
sururu
and
atapu
are
due
next
year
together
with
any
delayed
from
this
but
the
from
this
year
s
fpsos
is
likely
to
dominate
production
growth
there
are
none
due
for
note
petrobras
projects
have
a
hull
name
a
vessel
name
often
named
after
a
city
a
field
name
sometimes
two
or
three
plus
often
a
separate
name
from
the
leasing
company
and
they
often
change
these
during
development
by
reassigning
hulls
to
different
destinations
so
my
apologies
if
i
ve
got
some
of
the
above
s
been
a
lot
of
activity
since
despite
the
price
crash
and
petrobras
debt
and
corruption
problems
and
yet
production
has
slightly
declined
typically
the
large
fpsos
at
around
kbpd
take
to
months
to
ramp
up
see
below
adding
or
so
production
wells
and
to
injection
wells
but
two
are
needed
per
year
to
overcome
decline
rates
and
that
may
be
increasing
with
higher
overall
production
and
some
of
the
newer
santos
vessels
reaching
end
of
plateau
it
s
also
noteworthy
that
the
mature
campos
fields
have
been
showing
accelerated
decline
and
a
marked
jump
in
water
cut
recently
although
the
overall
basin
decline
will
be
ameliorated
by
the
of
the
latest
production
is
falling
faster
than
overall
production
partly
from
sales
of
older
fields
but
also
because
it
has
a
lower
ownership
ratio
of
the
new
growing
fields
than
of
the
mature
declining
ones

natural

is
not
a
large
natural
gas
producer
relative
to
oil
and
what
it
does
produce
looks
like
it
might
be
plateauing
the
new
oil
production
has
associated
gas
which
is
high
in
carbon

the
lula

being

commercially
while
the

is
which
is
not
commercial
and
will
be
for
pressure
support
there
are
currently
no
rigs
drilling
for
gas
and
only
about
one
or
two
since
so
near
term
new
gas
production
will
be
associated
with
oil
and
gas
imports
are
likely
to
be
increasing
the
largest
recent
gas
discovery
was
the
jupiter
field
in
the
santos
basin
which
was
originally
cited
as
having
over
gboe
of
gas
but
it
too
is
high
in
carbon
dioxide
and
the
current
number
looks
to
be
around
gboe
with

being

since
then

declined
slightly
probably
influenced
by
the
oil

maybe
also
because
of
the

of

there
will
likely
be
some
future

a

found
that
redeveloping

could

of

like
all
companies
and
not
only
those
under
heavy
political
influence
it
says
lots
of
things
that
don
t
always
pan
out
and
that
would
likely
involve
a
learning
period
and
slower
developments
and
would
mostly
be
applicable
only
to
new
discoveries
a
few
of
the
last
projects
on
existing

or
possibly
some
redevelopment
projects
there
are
possible
upsides
in

buzios
fields

equally
some
brazilian
discoveries
have
disappointed
and
it

still
relatively
early

seem
to
be
developed
for
around
mmbbls
of

reserve
each
and
to
have
about
decline
rates
coming
off
plateau
but
there
aren
t
many
that
have
reached
late
life
yet
so
these
could
go
either
way
what
is
almost
unique
for
brazil
compared
with
other
countries
is
that
the
fpsos
hit
plateaus
that
almost
exactly
match
the
nameplate
i
have
never
seen
any
attempt
to
accelerate
production
by
running
above
the
nameplate
in
the
early
years
which
would
happen
in
a
typical
north
sea
field
there
do
seem
to
be
some
projects
that
don
t
achieve
nameplate
but
relatively
few
i
don
t
know
if
this
is
because
the
fpsos
are
usually
cloned
rather
than
bespoke
designs
or
because
of
the
nature
of
the
