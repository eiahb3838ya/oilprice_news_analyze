exxon
is
betting
very
big
on
africa
for
its
next
big
find
the
supermajor
s
head
of
exploration
stephen
greenlee
told
bloomberg
in
an
interview
in
fact
greenlee
said
exxon
was
hoping
to
strike
a
discovery
of
a
billion
barrels
or
more
in
africa
what
is
known
in
the
industry
as
an
elephant
bloomberg
s
kevin
crowley
geological
survey
estimated
that
two
years
ago
there
were
at
least
billion
untapped
barrels
of
crude
oil
in
africa
alone
exxon
is
focusing
on
western
and
southern
africa
in
its
exploration
work
and
has
been
amassing
stakes
in
oil
and
gas
prospect
in
ghana
mauritania
namibia
and
south
ghana
exxon
tried
to
buy
kosmos
energy
s
stake
in
the
giant
jubilee
offshore
field
in
but
the
deal
was
blocked
by
the
ghana
authorities
last
year
the
supermajor
bought
straight
from
the
ghana
government
exploration
rights
for
an
adjacent
block
and
plans
were
to
begin
working
on
it
this
namibia
it
bought
a
stake
in
an
offshore
exploration
license
although
no
oil
has
yet
been
discovered
in
namibia
there
is
a
theory
that
its
offshore
basins
may
share
characteristics
with
brazil
s
campos
and
and
namibia
were
part
of
one
whole
a
few
billion
years
is
also
buying
seismic
data
we
re
acquiring
large
amounts
of
seismic
data
with
the
idea
that
in
the
future
one
or
two
of
those
are
going
to
turn
out
to
be
the
next
guyana
greenlee
said
these
are
large
acreage
positions
and
they
re
in
areas
that
we
think
have
promising
opportunities
for
hydrocarbon
perhaps
the
guyana
elephant
containing
an
estimated
billion
barrels
of
hopes
for
another
one
in
less
explored
parts
of
the
world
that
are
nevertheless
close
to
established
production
sites
such
as
nigeria
and
