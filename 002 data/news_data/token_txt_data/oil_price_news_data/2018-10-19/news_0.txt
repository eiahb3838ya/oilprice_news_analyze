are claims of peak oil production in russia overblown?
russian
authorities
have
announced
that
domestic
oil
production
hit
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
on
average
in
september
vedomosti
october
this
marks
a
new
historic
peak
despite
the
poor
shape
of
the
russian
economy
and
negative
impact
of
western
sanctions
not
to
mention
the
restrictions
on
moscow

october

at

skepticism
first
of
all
such
bearish
assessments
have
times
in
the
past
back
in
prime
minister
viktor
khristenko
that
oil
production
at
that
time
at
million

would
definitely
decline
after
versia

and
four
years
later
mikhail
krutikhin
one
of
russia
s
most
respected
energy
analysts
told
western
journalists
we
now
see
production
peaked
last
year
so
i
believe
the
decline
will
continue
for
quite

number
of
years

several
other
notable
examples
of
suggestions
that
the
russian
oil
output
had
peaked
could
also
be
mentioned
and
until
recently
the
consensus
forecast
for
stood
at

rate
recorded
last

output

to
grow
in

to

such
a
scenario
is
certainly
probable
but
it
will
only
be
achieved
as
long
as
several
difficult
conditions

wo

oilfirst
of
all
one
must
look
at
developments
not
only
in
russia
but
in
neighboring
countries
as
well
current
russian
production
though
a
record
is
only

the
levels
of
the
most
successful
year
for
the
soviet
oil
and
gas
industry
to
oil
output
in
kazakhstan
was
in
times
higher
than
in
while
last
year
s
production
in
azerbaijan
whose
deposits
were
previously
considered
the
most
exhausted
in
all
of
the
union
of
soviet
socialist
republics
ussr
were
times
greater
than
that
recorded
in
the
azeri
ssr
for
june
accessed
october
this
data
proves
a
simple
fact
output
figures
in
the
former
soviet
space
have
depended
strongly
on
the
presence
of
western
technology
in
the
domestic
industry
and
upon
the
governments
efforts
to
explore
new
oil
fields
in
order
to
substitute
old
and
overexploited
ones
of
course
all
this
is
further
subject
to
two
critical
factors
the
first
is
the
global
price
of
oil
which
can
make
the
development
of
the
least
accessible
profitable
if
the
price
exceeds
per
barrel
russia
would
be
able
to
explore
and
to
make
operational
its
giant
arctic
oil
deposits
thus
adding
at
least
percent
to
current
production
levels
april
the
second
factor
is
the
level
of
free
national
champions
and
multinational
majors
in
kazakhstan
for
example
the
of
foreign
in
oil
production
in
the
early

version

next
condition
dictating
whether
russian
oil
production
levels
can
keep
growing
is
the
inherent
efficiency
of
the
domestic
extraction
industry
even
after
around
two
decades
of
increasing
investment
russian
oil
companies
still
produce
only
percent
of
oil
from
their
wells
the
average
figure
for
british
producers

december
september
this
results
from
the
government
s
policies
which
do
not
place
any
strict
regulations
on
recovery
at
existing
deposits
were
the
recovery
rates
to
rise
at
least
to
the
average
level
of
european
firms
russia
would
be
able
to
add
at
least
theoretically
up
to
barrels
to
its
daily
output
in
fact
it
would
also
result
in
longer
service
lives
for
existing
oilfields
the
russian
government
has
repeatedly
shown
an
inability
to
press
domestic
companies
to
adopt
new
technologies
and
attempts
to
set
tighter
standards
has
failed
many
times
perhaps
the
most
dramatic
example
of
the
latter
occurred
in
early
when
a
fuel
crisis
erupted
in
russia
after
gasoline
was
banned
from
the
market
due
to
the
inability
of
the
largest
company
rosneft
to
meet
new
regulations

third
russia
s
oil
output
has
for
years
been
held
back
by
a
lack
of
in
the
domestic
energy
market
in
too
many
cases
private
companies
are
banned
from
exploring
new
deposits
illustratively
only
those
corporations
that
are

the
result
of
these
uncompetitive
policies
has
been
in
part
to
keep
overall
production
levels
lower
than
they
might
otherwise
have
been
and
another
important
trend
worth
highlighting
is
the
fact
that
many
companies
are
now
trying
to
secure
not
only
dominant
but
monopolistic
positions
within
the
monopolies
as
a
rule
tend
to
contribute
to
lower
growth
rates
for
example
last
year
rosneft
managed
to
wrest
control
over
bashneft
a
regional
company
that
was
declared
illegally
privatized
several
years
before
when
it
operated
as
a
private
bashneft
increased
production
from
to
bpd
between
and
however
in
its
production
fell
by
percent
due
primarily
to
the
ineffectiveness
of
rosneft
s
management
february
march
if
one
into
account
that
currently
there
are
fewer
than
oil
and
gas
companies
operating
in
with
more
than
percent
of
overall
output
coming
from
just
of
them
in
the
united
states
there
exists
more
than
of
such
with
percent
of
us
oil
and
percent
of
us
natural
gas
produced
by
small
independent
firms
accessed
october
the
successes
of
the
russian
oil
industry
look
at
best
quite
russian
oil
production
not
due
to
the
government
s
policies
but
actually
despite
them
if
the
country
chooses
to
embrace
modern
principles
of
state
regulation
and
opens
its
oil
and
gas
industry
to
foreign
competition
domestic
output
levels
will
almost
certainly
be
free
to
continue
to
grow
