is the shale boom a certainty?
among
the
fears
that
grip
today
s
oil
markets
nothing
is
as
strong
as
the
uncontrollable
rise
of
shale
production
while
opec
and
its
partners
have
managed
to
push
oil
prices
back
to

soaring
shale
production
looms
over
markets
threatening

the

estimates
that
it
will
cross

while
this
projected
growth
is
staggering
the
continued
strength
of
today
s
shale
boom
is
far
from
certain
companies
are
shifting
management
strategies
to
pursue
profit
over
growth
and
the
incredible
technological
advancements
accomplished
thus
far
will
have
to
the
reported
shift
by
producers
from
focusing
on
growth
to
targeting
profitability
could
slow
production
to
achieve
growth
companies
have
had
to
accumulate
debts

shale

are

a

consultant
in
the
oil
gas
industry
is
bullish
on
shale
growth
claiming
that
the
focus
has
certainly
shifted
from
profitability
to
growth
and
that
shale
producers
tend
to
hedge
on
higher
prices
to
protect
their
production
in

view
at
almost
there
will
be
plenty
