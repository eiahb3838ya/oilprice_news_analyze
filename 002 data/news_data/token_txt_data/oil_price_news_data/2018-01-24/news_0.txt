inflation
may
be
a
curse
for
the
e

companies
but
it
s
a
welcome
boon
for
the
oilfield
services
industry
that
has
suffered
from
the
very
low
pricing
during
the
downturn
related
the
biggest
year
yet
for

only
the
world
s
largest
oilfield

are
upbeat
on
the
prospects
for
the

analysts
also
say
that
there
are
reasons
to
believe
that
the
oilfield
services
business
is
starting
to
exit
survival
rising
oil
prices
e
p
companies
raised
capital
expenditures
in
north
american
shale
and
the
number
of
offshore
projects
by
more
than
percent
in
which
resulted
in
a
restart
of

industry
rystad
energy
said
in
a
report
last
month
companies
that
beat
the
overall
market
were
mostly
those
exposed
to
north
american
shale
while
laggards
are
mainly
exposed
to
the
offshore
and
subsea
suppliers
in
the
have
started
hiring
and
have
been
increasing
their
workforce
by
every
month
since
october
for
the
offshore
market
suppliers
have
stepped
down
and
are
in
the
last
phase
of
completing
workforce
reductions
rystad
consultancy
expects
offshore
and
onshore
greenfield
projects
worth
as
much
as
billion
to
be
sanctioned
globally
this
year
which
would
result
in
an
average
of
service
price
from
the
upbeat
outlooks
from
halliburton
and
schlumberger
this
year
could
finally
mark
the
end
of
the
downturn
