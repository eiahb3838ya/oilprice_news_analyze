opec+ succeeds, whatâ€™s next for oil?
oil
prices
spiked
on
friday
on
news
from
managed
to
pull
off
an
agreement
checking
all
the
boxes
after
a
contentious
set
of
meetings
there
were
a
lot
of
competing
interests
at
play
but
the
agreement
offers
a
little
bit
of
everything
enough
for
all
parties
to
walk
away
headliner
is
the
cut
beginning
in
january
with
a
review
scheduled
for
april
opec
will
shoulder
bpd
of
the
total
and
countries
will
take
on
the
other
bpd
the
baseline
used
to
measure
the
cuts
is
october
production
cut
is
larger
than
some
analysts
had
expected
especially
given
the
rumors
swirling
on
thursday
about
a
cut
of
around
in
fact
one
could
argue
that
the
group
cleverly
managed
market
expectations
lowering
them
on
thursday
only
to
surprise
the
market
with
a
larger
cut
on
friday
prior
to
the
meeting
might
have
been
considered
a
cut
but
after
the
seemingly
tumultuous
set
of
meetings
on
thursday
and
early
friday
a
cut
ends
up
looking
like
a
highly
successful
had
held
up
the
talks
early
friday
saudi
arabia
pushed
for
them
to
agree
to
a
symbolic
cut
an
odd
position
given
that
iran
s
output
at
this
point
is
far
below
capacity
and
far
below
its
prior
ceiling
iran
with
good
reason
argued
that
it
should
not
have
to
sign
on
to
any
cuts
especially
since
sanctions
are
likely
going
to
curtail
output
even
further
in
the
months
rumors
on
friday
were
that
the
holdup
could
sink
a
deal
but
that
was
never
going
to
be
the
case
it
s
extremely
hard
to
imagine
saudi
arabia
walking
away
from
a
deal
that
included
meaningful
cuts
from
other
producers
just
because
iran
wouldn
t
symbolically
cut
their
output
related
oil
prices
hold
steady
as
canadian
oil
rig
count
take
steep
diveultimately
the
result
was
a
quirky
one
all
countries
appear
to
be
participants
in
the
deal
but
there
won
t
be
quotas
iran
did
not
receive
an
official
exemption
some
opec
officials
argued
even
as
the
iranians
claimed
they
did
other
officials
said
that
there
would
be
special
this
point
is
a
matter
of
splitting
hairs
iran
s
production
is
likely
to
fall
in
the
coming
months
it
doesn
t
really
matter
what
they
call
it
that
s
also
why
this
issue
was
not
going
to
be
the
thing
that
sunk
the
entire
prices
spiked
on
the
news
with
brent
up
around
percent
immediately
after
the
agreement
was
as
expected
played
a
pivotal
role
in
the
deal
and
its
willingness
to
go
along
with
a
cut
was
the
key
factor
in
the
reduction
although
russia
s
precise
contribution
was
not
known
at
the
time
of
this
writing
deal
can
be
called
a
success
for
two
reasons
first
it
takes
off
of
the
market
beginning
in
january
which
will
go
a
long
way
to
erasing
the
surplus
second
it
removes
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
about
what
to
expect
in
the
near
future
oil
prices
have
been
all
over
the
map
in
the
last
few
months
with
saudi
production
surging
at
a
time
when
shale
was
also
defying
expectations
now
it
s
reasonable
to
assume
that
any
surplus
or
deficit
won
t
be
so
large
as
to
lead
to
dramatic
price
swings
at
least
in
the
short
run
related
could
iraq
be
the
next
opec
member
to
exit
however
the
one
remaining
piece
of
uncertainty
is
how
or
if
the
government
will
react
president
trump
has
repeatedly
demanded
low
oil
prices
and
tweeted
as
recently
as
wednesday
to
that
effect
typically
opec
would
not
be
all
that
sensitive
to
trump
s
demands
but
saudi
arabia
is
reeling
after
the
international
outrage
over
the
murder
of
jamal
khashoggi
a
bipartisan
movement
in
washington
is
upping
the
pressure
on
riyadh
and
trump
has
been
one
of
the
few
friends
saudi
arabia
has
oil
prices
rise
too
much
trump
might
lash
out
and
dump
the
saudis
although
what
that
means
in
practice
is
very
much
unclear
due
to
extreme
budgetary
pressure
from
low
oil
prices
saudi
arabia
had
no
choice
but
to
risk
trump
s
ire
and
push
for
meaningfully
supply
now
is
likely
patting
themselves
on
the
back
they
reached
an
agreement
that
is
mostly
acceptable
to
everyone
oil
prices
are
up
the
surplus
will
narrow
significantly
and
uncertainty
is
greatly
the
agreement
calls
for
a
review
in
april
the
timing
is
not
coincidental
waivers
granted
to
eight
countries
importing
iranian
oil
expire
in
may
by
april
everyone
will
know
much
more
about
what
direction
washington
intends
to
go
in
and
how
much
oil
iran
will
lose
if
iranian
exports
are
rapidly
falling
to
zero
would
have
time
to
unwind
the
production
