refiners struggle to adapt to the shale boom
shale
production
is
at
record
highs
and
the
momentum
is
still
not
over
a
lot
has
been
said
about
the
energy
implications
of
this
trend
but
there
s
something
that
has
not
garnered
a
lot
of
attention
shale
is
light
crude
great
for
making
gasoline
and
other
light
fuels
but
not
so
great
for
products
such
as
middle
distillates
why
this
is
important
because
gasoline
demand
is
stagnating
while
demand
for
middle
distillates
is
set
for
a
serious
boost
ahead
of
the
new
imo
regulations

a
recent
article
for

mackenzie

vp

chemicals
and
oil
markets
alan
gelder
warned
that
refiners
may
very
soon
find
themselves
struggling
with
excess
production
of
gasoline
that
exceeds
demand
for
the
fuel
at
the
same
time
to
make
matters
worse
the
production
slump
in
venezuela
is
reducing
the
availability
of
heavy
crude
needed
for
middle
distillates
not
to
mention
that
not
all
refiners
have
upgraded
their
facilities
to
produce
more
bunkering
fuel
problem
concerns
asia
as
well
gelder
notes
most
refineries
there
need
heavy
sour
crude
to
function
and
there
could
be
a
shortage
of
this
particular
type
of
crude
on
the
horizon
because
of
the
situation
in
you
are
wondering
if
this
shortage
may
have
something
to
do
with
beijing
s
recent
decision
to
extend
a
us
lifeline
to
caracas
you
may
have
a
point
iran
also
produces
heavy
crude
besides
a
light
grade
and
condensate
and
this
too
will
be
cut
off
from
markets
if
we
are
to
believe
the
dominant
narrative
arguing
that
iran
will
lose
more
than
half
of
its
exports
when
sanctions
kick
good
news
is
that
according
to
the
wood
mac
expert
things
will
change
soon
enough
and
the
shortage
if
it
ever
occurs
will
be
chinese
refiners
are
spending
a
lot
of
money
on
upgrades
that
will
increase
their
portion
of
gasoline
and
reduce
the
production
of
other
fuels
notably

and
gas

is
fine
if
only
gasoline
demand
grows
but
the
imo
emissions
rules
will
also
spur
greater
demand

the

that
are
called

come

and
heavy
ones

oil
depending
on
how
strong
this
spur
is
a
shortage
might
occur
although
according
to
gelder
the
chances
of
that
happening
are
not
that
it
would
pay
to
be
prepared
gelder
may
be
skeptical
about
the
extent
of
the
disruption
that
imo
s
new
rules
will
have
but
others
see
it
as
one
of
the
greatest
shocks
that
the
oil

has
ever
