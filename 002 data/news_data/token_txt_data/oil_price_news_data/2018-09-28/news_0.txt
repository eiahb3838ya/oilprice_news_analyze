ignore the hype – oil prices aren’t going back to $100
the
breakout
in
brent
crude
prices
above
this
week
has
prompted
analysts
at
the
sell
side
banks
to
start
talking
about
a
return
to
a
barrel
oil
even
president
trump
has
gotten
involved
demanding
that
opec
ramp
up
production
to
send
oil
prices
lower
before
they
start
to
weigh
on
consumer
spending
which
has
helped
fuel
the
economic
boom
over
which
trump
has
presided
and
for
which
he
has
been
eager
to
take
to
hear
respected
petroleum
geologist
and
oil
analyst
art
berman
tell
it
trump
should
relax
that
because
supply
fundamentals
in
the
market
suggest
that
the
recent
breakout
in
prices
will
be
largely
ephemeral
and
that
crude
supplies
will
soon
move
back
into
a
a
close
analysis
of
supply
trends
suggests
that
the
secular
deflationary
trend
in
oil
prices
remains
very
much
intact
and
in
an
interview
with
macrovoices
berman
laid
out
his
argument
using
a
handy
chart
deck
to
illustrate
his
findings
some
of
these
charts
are
excerpted
below
the
bedrock
for
his
argument
berman
uses
a
metric
that
he
calls
comparative
petroleum
inventories
instead
of
just
looking
at
eia
inventory
data
berman
adjusts
these
figures
by
comparing
them
to
the
five
year
average
for
any
given
week
this
smooths
out
purely
seasonal
as
he
shows
in
the
following
chart
changes
in
comparative
inventory
levels
have
precipitated
most
of
the
shifts
in
oil
prices
since
the
early
berman
explains
as
the
charts

inventories
for
crude
oil

refined

products

looking

of
this
year
when
the
rally

accelerate
we
can
on
the

how
inventories
crossed
below
their
historical
average
which
berman
claims
prompted
the
most
recent
run
up

prices

future

inventories
typically
correlate
negatively
to
the
price
of
wti
but
occasionally
perceptions
of
supply
security
may
prompt
producers
to
either
ramp
up
or
cut
back
production
one
example
of
this
preceded
the
ramp
of
prices
that
started
in
when
markets
drove
prices
higher
despite
supplies
being
above
their
historical
average
the
ramp
continued
even
as
supplies
increased
largely
due
to
fears
