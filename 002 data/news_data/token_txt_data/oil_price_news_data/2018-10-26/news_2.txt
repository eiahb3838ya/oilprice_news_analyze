intermediate
crude

futures
are
set
to
finish
lower
for
the
third
straight
week
what
began
as
a
simple
pullback
in
a
prolonged
uptrend
is
rapidly
becoming
a
controlled
by
factors
outside
the
realm
of
the
traditional
traders
usually
have
the
tools
to
control
specific
risk
or
diversifiable
risk
this
is
the
type
of
uncertainty
that
arises
with
the
commodity
you
invest
in
this
unsystematic
risk
is
usually
reduced
through
diversification
when
unsystematic
risk
arises
for
typical
crude
oil
investors
they
have
several
choices
including
taking
profits
moving
stops
to
protect
profits
or
spreading
their
positions
with
other
futures
contracts
there
is
no
panic
and
usually
the
process
is
the
case
of
crude
oil
investors
started
to
book
profits
when
uncertainty
developed
over
whether
there
would
be
a
supply
oil
prices
rallied
over
per

from
late
august
to
early
october
on
the
thought
that
the
sanctions
against
iran
which
start
on
november
would
cause
a
global

shortage
as
of

some
analysts
were
calling
for
crude
case
for
this
occurring
began
to
weaken
in
early
october
when
saudi
arabia
and
russia
pledged
to
offset
any
shortfall
in
supply
this
fueled
the
initial
stages
of
the
pullback
which
was
a
normal
move
in
any
bull
market
until
systematic
risk
also
known
as
market
risk
or
risk
hit
the
risk
started
to
become
a
factor
in
the
crude
oil
market
on
october
when
concerns
over
rapidly
rising
treasury
yields
fueled
a
steep
drop
in
equity
markets
this
sent
volatility
to
heightened
levels
which
spread
across
all
markets
including
currencies
and
commodities
other
factors
contributing
to
the
increase
in
volatility
including
lingering
concerns
over
the
trade
dispute
simmering
tensions
between
the
european
union
and
the
italian
government
over
budgetary
issues
and
saudi
arabia
s
involvement
in
the
death
of
journalist
jamal
of
these
factors
make
great
headlines
but
the
real
reason
for
the
in
my
opinion
was
the
liquidation
by
the
hedge
funds
government
data
showed
the
hedge
funds
were
net
long
as
we
approached
the
october
highs
data
since
then
shows
the
hedge
funds
have
reduced
their
long
positions
and
increased
their
short
may
have
started
as
simple
because
of
a
gradual
change
in
the
fundamentals
regarding
a
potential
oil
shortage
unsystematic
risk
blossomed
into
aggressive
liquidation
due
to
the
unexpected
stock
market
volatility
systematic
risk
the
surprise
drop
in
equity
markets
led
to
margin
calls
which
may
have
forced
the
hedge
funds
to
dump
profitable
crude
oil
positions
in
order
to
raise
much
needed
cash
this
changed
what
was
a
normal
correction
on
the
charts
into
a
change
in
trend
on
the
the
volatility
settles
crude
oil
traders
will
be
faced
with
another
dilemma
on
friday
the
narrative
shifted
to
concerns
about
the
market
being
oversupplied
soon
while
losses
in
the
global
equity
markets
steepened
increasing
worries
about
analysts
maintain
the
fundamentals
in
oil
remain
broadly
bullish
because
of
the
sanctions
against
iran
s
oil
exports
however
no
one
can
ignore
that
crude
oil
stockpiles
rose
last
week
for
the
fifth
consecutive
week
while
gasoline
and
distillate
inventories
fell
according
to
the
energy
information
administration
related
what
s
behind
the
latest

these
assessments
show
up
on
the
charts
with
the
main
trends
up
on
the
monthly
and
weekly
charts
and
down
on
the
daily
at
the
charts
of
various
time
periods
it
looks
like
the
crude
oil
is
likely
to
continue
until
the
crude
oil
market
finds
value
this
is
not
likely
to
occur
until
the
stock
market
volatility
slows
and
investors
can
return
to
focusing
on
the
traditional
i
would
really
like
to
see
is
a
divergence
between
the
stock
market
and
crude
oil
at
this
time
they
seem
to
be
moving
in
perhaps
we
ll
see
this
start
taking
shape
as
we
approach
the
start
of
the
sanctions
on
november
analysisone
way
to
deal
with
the
volatility
is
to
strip
it
out
of
the
charts
by
looking
at
the
charts
then
working
down
to
the
daily
charts
you
have
to
remember
when
dealing
with
charts
is
that
they
represent
past
data
the
charts
identify
points
that
can
provide
information
on
the
trend
as
well
as
support
and
resistance
levels
however
the
turns
in
the
market
are
controlled
by
the
buying
volume
and
selling
volume
so
it
is
suggested
that
you
watch
the
price
action
and
read
the
order
flow
at
each
key
support
or
resistance
level
in
order
to
determine
if
the
buyers
or
sellers
are
