u.s. shale drillers to become profitable for the first time
oil
companies
have
stepped
up
their
hedging
for
production
locking
in
sales
at
higher
the
fourth
quarter
producers
increased
the

of
their
output
secured
under
hedges
to
percent
up
from
just
percent
in
the
third
quarter
according
to
a

hedging
has
moved
from
normal
levels
to

finds
that

increased
by

its

goldman
forecasts
an
average
oil
price
of
per
barrel
for
this
year
which
would
mean
that
the
majority
of
companies
would
lose
out
by
being
locked
into
hedges
if
prices
stay
where
they
are
now
in

would

not
much

there
is
a
danger
of
missing
out
on
the
upswing
if
the
oil
market
tightens
later
this
year
hedges
will
also
protect
companies
from
any

downturn
forecasts
of
explosive
shale
growth
are
being
watched
with
concern
and
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
have
recently
stepped
up
their
short
bets
on
oil
while
the
wti
futures
curve
has
been
in
a
state
of
backwardation
for
much
of
the
past
two
months
the
curve
has
recently
flattened
out
as
the
bullish
sentiment
has
started
to
disappear
the
spread
for
the
first
two
wti
contracts
is
dangerously
close
to
switching
from
backwardation
to
contango
bob
yawger
director
of
futures
division
at
mizuho
securities
usa
told
bloomberg
that
would
be
a
very
negative
price
a
contango
is
a
situation
in
which
front
month
oil
futures
trade
at
a
discount
to
futures
which
is
typically
interpreted
as
a
sign
of
bearishness
backwardation
in
which
front
month
contracts
trade
at
a
premium
the
opposite
of
contango
had
emerged
a
few
months
ago
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
and
the
development
was
seen
as
a
sign
that
the
oil
market
was
finally
beginning
to
things
you
didn
t
know
about
oilthe
return
of
a
contango
would
likely
cause
oil
trading
to
become
more
volatile
and
perhaps
could
push
spot
prices
down

you
re
taking
a
speculative
short
