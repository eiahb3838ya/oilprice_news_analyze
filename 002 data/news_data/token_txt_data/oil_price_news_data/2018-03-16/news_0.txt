why u.s. oil exports are surging
crude
oil
exports
are
surging
and
going
to
a
growing
number
of
buyers
around
the
world
including
to
the
demand
centers
in
asia
the
traditional
stronghold
of
the
middle
eastern
oil
production
expanding
pipeline
and
export
capacity
and
the
more
than
discount
of
wti
spot
prices
to
brent
supported
the
surge
in
oil
exports
last
year
it
looks
like
these
three
key
drivers
of
american
production
higher
capacity
and
higher
here
to
stay
leading
to
a
continued
increase
in
overseas
shipments
much
to
the
frustration
of
opec
exporters
whose
market
share
of
the
prized
asian
market
is
starting
to
the
second
full
year
since
the
restrictions
on
crude
oil
exports
were
removed
in
late
american
oil
exports
almost
doubled
compared
to
averaging
million
bpd
the
eia
said
this
shipped
its
oil
to
countries
last
year
up
from
in
canada
was
still
the
biggest
export
market
for
oil
but
its
total
share
dropped
to
percent
last
year
from
percent
in
the
most
notable
increase
in
exports
was
recorded
in
none
other
than
china
where
russia
and
saudi
arabia
have
been
competing
for
years
for
the
top
spot
with
russia
having
gained
the
upper
hand
in
the
past
two
crude
oil
exports
to
china
accounted
for
the
total
increase
in
american
exports
in
eia
data
showed
china
surpassed
the
united
kingdom
and
the
netherlands
to
become
the
destination
for
crude
oil
exports
last
year
just
behind
large
asian
crude
oil
importer
india
which
had
not
received
any
oil
in
bought
bpd
in
to
tie
with
spain
as
the
destination
of
american
crude
s
not
only
the
high
production
that
drove
the
increased
exports
the
spread
was
a
major
incentive
last
year
spot
brent
prices
averaged
a
barrel
more
than
wti
prices
in
compared
with
just
a
barrel
more
in
providing
a
price
incentive
to
export
crude
oil
into
the
international
market
the
eia
said
related
canada
is
facing
a
heavy
crude
crisisaccording
to
the
eia
this
year
similar
production
infrastructure
and
price
conditions
will
be
necessary
to
keep
exports
trending
upwards
and
it
looks
like
all
these
conditions
are
likely
to
be
fulfilled
in
crude
oil
production
will
average
million
bpd
in
up
from
the
average
million
bpd
in
and
wti
prices
will
average
a

lower
than
brent
prices
in
both
and
the
eia

its
latest

this

total
oil
production
has
already
surpassed
that
of
opec

leading
producer
saudi

and
the

is
on
track
to
topple

to

expanded

these
