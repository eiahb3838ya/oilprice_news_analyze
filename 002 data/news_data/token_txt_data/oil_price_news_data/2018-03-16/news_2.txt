the truth about aramco’s $2 trillion valuation
two
trillion
dollars
this
was
the
price
tag
riyadh
put
on
the
jewel
in
its
crown
state
oil
and
gas
giant
aramco
this
is
how
much
the
company
was
worth
officials
said
if
you
multiplied
its
proven
reserves
by
a
factor
of
us
which
is
the
figure
used
to
value
oil
and
gas
were
doubts
about
that
valuation
from
the
start
and
now
these
are
deepening
as
the
company
crawls
closer
to
the
initial
public
offering
for
starters
aramco
s
opacity
was
very
likely
to
make
potential
investors
has
never
published
financial
reports
although
there
were
assurances
that
it
will
start
doing
so
ahead
of
the
ipo
to
date
the
latest
entry
on
aramco
s
corporate
reports
page
is
from
july
last
year
and
includes
production
figures
for
last
year
sources
had
told
reuters
the
company
was
planning
to
start
publishing
financial
reports
early
this
year
but
this
has
not
happened
these
concerns
aside
there
is
the
bigger
problem
of
the
valuation
methodology
itself
in
a
blunt
but
very
informative
story
for
bloomberg
gadfly
liam
denning
suggests
that
aramco
may
need
crude
oil
at
us
a
barrel
to
get
the
us
valuation
it
claims
it
has
that
s
in
addition
to
making
several
wild
assumptions
along
the
oil
world
today
is
different
from
what
it
was
just
five
years
ago
the
oil
price
collapse
taught
oil
producers
to
be
more
economical
and
to
pick
their
projects
more
carefully
to
keep
cash
flows
coming
in
and
sharing
them
with
shareholders
yes
they
had
to
sell
additional
stock
and
some
suspended
dividends
but
the
lesson
was
learned
and
the
moment
prices
started
perking
up
dividends
returned
and
stock
was
bought
things
you
didn
t
know
about
oilyields
are
what
investors
want
when
they
consider
whether
to
invest
in
a
company
denning
says
they
don
t
care
about
proven
reserves
and
production
costs
as
such
instead
they
care
about
how
these
can
turn
into
dividends
it
s
as
simple
as
that
but
this
is
where
it
stops
being
average
free
cash
flow
yield
of
the
global
oil
supermajors
is
between
and
percent
russia
s
rosneft
while
not
a
supermajor
per
se
sports
the
highest
one
at
percent
while
exxon
has
the
lowest
at
percent
based
on
these
actual
figures
denning
makes
an
entertaining
set
of
calculations
involving
major
assumptions
about
the
price
of
oil
aramco
s
production
and
costs
and
profit
result
is
that
to
lure
investors
with
a
cash
flow
yield
the
minimum
that
would
make
it
competitive
aramco
needs
oil
to
sell
for
us
a
barrel
this
is
the
only
scenario
where
it
can
be
valued
at
us
trillion
the
only
scenario
out
of
all
based
on
favorable
is
not
going
up
to
us
anytime
soon
unless
something
cataclysmic
happens
denning
is
also
factoring
in
the
inherent
regional
risk
in
the
middle
east
that
is
likely
to
act
as
a
deterrent
to
potential
investors
the
publicity
machine
around
the
ipo
has
begun
to
creak
already
recently
all
those
suspecting
aramco
won
t
make
its
own
deadline
for
the
ipo
had
to
pleasure
to
be
proved
right
saudi
officials
said
it
will
be
delayed
until
next
bloomberg
is
reporting
that
investors
have
misgivings
about
the
ipo
citing
sources
wishing
to
remain
unnamed
bloomberg
had
this
to
say
among
the
issues
raised
were
the
trillion
valuation
saudi
arabia
wants
for
the
world
s
largest
oil
producer
the
scale
of
dividends
aramco
s
prepared
to
pay
and
the
impact
of
the
shale
boom
on
oil
prices
over
the
next
few
investors
want
cash
not
massive
reserves
maybe
this
would
prove
a
lesson
aramco
has
to
learn
