sri
lanka
will
pay
down
its
oil
debt
held
by
iran
with
tea
in
response
to
new
regulations
that
sri
lanka
has
issued
in
order
to
comply
with
a
un
security
council
un
resolution
calls
for
the
imposition
of
sanctions
on

ceylon
petroleum
corporation
cpc
sri
lanka
s
oil
and
gas
company
owes
iran
about
million
for
oil
shipments
in
recent
months
but
restrictions
on
payments
limits
cpc
s
options
on
how
to
pay
for
the
oil
the
sri
lanka
tea
board
proposed
a
solution
compensate
iran
with
tea
instead
of
proposal
would
have
the
cpc
pay
for
the
tea
then
the
tea
would
be
shipped
to
if
the
cpc
pays
us
we
can
continue
the
export
of
tea
to
iran
as
there
is
no
ban
on
this
commodity
the
amount
the
cpc
owes
iran
can
offset
payment
for
a
year
of
tea
export
to
iran
tea

lucille
wijewardena
said
adding

there
would
be
more

iea
world
is
not
spending
enough
on
energysri
lanka
has
long
relied
on
iran
s
participation
in
various
energy
projects
including
upgrading
oil
refineries
as
well
as
chipping
in
on
hydroelectric
projects
and
rural
electrification
agreed
in
may
to
build
a
new
refinery
for
sri
lanka
on
top
of
upgrading
an
existing
oil
refinery
that
iran
had
built
for
sri
lanka
in
refinery
built
specifically
to
refine
iranian
light
crude
but
in
the
wake
of
the
first
round
of
us
sanctions
on
iran
sri
lanka
was
forced
to
look
for
other
is
the
fourth
largest
market
for
sri
lankan
ceylon
tea
accounting
for
of
its
total
payments
in
tea
may
be
a
technically
acceptable
method
of
skirting
un
sanctions
the
million
that
s
owed
is
for
a
couple
of
months
worth
of
oil
whereas
it
would
take
a
year
s
worth
of
tea
to
compensate
it
is
unclear
how
future
oil
shipments
to
sri
lanka
will
be
paid
