anti-opec bill could be a game-changer for oil markets
in
its
effort
to
wrest
more
control
over
global
oil
markets
away
from
foreign
producers
congress
has
been
pushing
a
bill
that
would
let
the
sue
opec
for
oil
price
fixing
the
bill
called
no
oil
producing
and
exporting
cartels
act
or
nopec
was
first
introduced
in
two
republican
senators
and
two
democrats
introduced
legislation
last
week
that
s
aimed
at
allowing
the
government
to
bring
lawsuits
against
opec
members
for
antitrust
violations
which
would
be
an
amendment
to
the
sherman
act
of
sherman
act
changed
american
business
culture
it
was
the
first
legislation
enacted
by
congress
to
curb
concentrations
of
power
that
interfere
with
trade
and
reduce
economic
competition
one
of
the
act
s
main
provisions
outlaws
all
combinations
that
restrain
trade
between
states
or
with
foreign
prohibition
applies
not
only
to
formal
cartels
but
also
to
any
agreement
to
fix
prices
limit
industrial
output
share
markets
or
exclude
competition
the
second
part
of
the
act
and
key
provision
that
most
americans
are
familiar
with
makes
illegal
all
attempts
to
monopolize
any
part
of
trade
or
commerce
in
the
country
some
companies
to
be
charged
under
the
act
include
the
breakup
of
at
t
in
the
with
the
creation
of
regional
phone
companies
or
and
microsoft
which
was
found
in
violation
of
the
act
in
but
successfully
appealed
a
breakup
of
the
company
in
it
s
long
past
time
to
put
an
end
to
illegal
price
fixing
by
opec
chuck
grassley
one
of
the
republican
senators
to
push
the
legislation
said
in
a
statement
last
week
we
are
committed
to
reducing
our
reliance
on
foreign
oil
especially
when
it
s
artificially
and
illegally
priced
our
bill
shows
the
opec
members
we
will
not
tolerate
their
flagrant
antitrust
related
is
the
oil
world
in
panic
mode
however
the
nopec
idea
is
nothing
new
and
dates
back
to
at
least
both
president
george
bush
and
president
barack
obama
threatened
to
use
their
veto
power
to
halt
it
from
becoming
law
in
a
similar
bill
passed
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
a
vote
and
in
the
senate
by
only
to
fail
afterward
in
the
face
of
white
house
opposition
this
time
around
however
there
is
a
good
chance
that
trump
would
sign
such
a
bill
into
rhetorictrump
has
been
critical
of
opec
for
years
and
during
the
presidential
election
that
war
of
words
escalated
to
the
front
pages
of
international
newspapers
trump
said
at
the
time
that
the
should
block
all
oil
imports
from
saudi
arabia
trump
also
vowed
to
secure
american
energy
independence
from
our
foes
and
the
oil
cartels
while
also
creating
complete
american
energy
response
just
days
after
trump
was
elected
saudi
arabia
oil
minister
and
aramco
chairman
khalid
fired
back
he
said
in
a
financial
times
interview
that
at
his
heart
trump
will
see
the
benefits
of
saudi
oil
imports
and
i
think
the
oil
industry
will
also
be
advising
him
accordingly
that
blocking
trade
in
any
product
is
not
the
is
sort
of
the
for
capitalism
and
free
markets
added
the
continues
to
be
a
very
important
part
of
a
global
industry
that
is
interconnected
that
is
dealing
with
a
fungible
commodity
which
is
crude
oil
so
having
equalization
through
free
trade
is
very
healthy
for
the
saudi
oil
minister
added
that
the
saudis
were
waiting
for
trump
s
presidency
as
his
presidential
campaign
had
amounted
to
feet
announcements
that
may
that
time
trump
and
saudi
arabia
have
turned
the
relations
between
the
two
countries
back
on
firming
footing
saudi
arabia
was
instrumental
in
persuading
trump
to
reimpose
sanctions
against
iran
while
riyadh
for
its
part
has
seemingly
kowtowed
to
trump
s
tweets
calling
for
opec
and
the
saudis
to
commit
to
higher
oil
production
to
offset
high
oil
and
gas
prices
a
point
of
contention
for
the
administration
as
congressional
election
in
november
the
opec
monopoly
must
remember
that
gas
prices
are
up
they
are
doing
little
to
help
if
anything
they
are
driving
prices
higher
as
the
united
states
defends
many
of
their
members
for
very
little
s
this
must
be
a
street
reduce
pricing
now
trump
tweeted
in
one
of
several
warnings
to
opec
related
iraq
orders
internet
blackout
to
quell
protestshowever
despite
the
current
revamping
of
the
playbook
on
checking
iranian
geological
influence
in
the
middle
east
and
its
nuclear
development
ambitions
trump
only
months
in
office
is
increasingly
showing
an
unprecedented
ability
to
offend
long
standing
allies
while
appeasing
long
term
rivals
including
russia
and
north
market
dynamicsthe
danger
for
relations
however
if
a
nopec
bill
was
passed
by
both
houses
and
signed
into
law
by
the
president
would
be
cataclysmic
it
would
indicate
more
american
geopolitical
and
even
economic
hegemony
and
destabilize
global
oil
markets
and
the
structure
of
middle
eastern
geopolitics
though
many
balk
as
opec
and
the
saudis
regain
control
of
global
oil
markets
a
forced
of
that
system
would
be
counterproductive
and
likely
see
more
agreement
over
oil
mark
control
as
well
as
geopolitical
deals
being
only
would
the
saudis
balk
at
what
they
deemed
as
a
frontal
an
attack
on
the
economic
lifeblood
of
the
country
but
of
the
ruling
royal
family
but
they
would
have
a
hard
time
understanding
it
it
should
be
remembered
that
opec
and
now
opec
with
its
partners
are
masters
at
colluding
and
controlling
supply
and
even
geopolitics
in
an
effort
to
control
prices
something
not
allowed
under
the
best
course
for
lawmakers
and
trump
would
be
to
let
the
market
determine
prices
demand
and
even
geopolitical
developments
and
to
not
unduly
interfere

the
