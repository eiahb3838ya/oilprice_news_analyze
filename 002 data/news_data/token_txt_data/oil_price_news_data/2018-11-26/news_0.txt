how president trump is undermining u.s. oil producers
president
trump
recently
took
credit
for
the
plunge
in
oil
prices
since
early
october
as
i
noted
in
a
recent
article
it
s
true
that
the
president
s
actions
have
contributed
to
the
drop
in
oil
prices
but
at
a
cost
that
has
been
largely
week
the
president
decided
to

trump

priceslet
s
trade
war
with
china
resulted
in
china
halting
imports
of
oil
prior
to
that
oil
producers
had
been
shipping
half
a
million
barrels
a
day
to
china
this
loss
of
market
hurt
oil
producers
and
helped
push
inventories
higher
in
the
this
further
hurt
oil
producers
by
pushing
prices
leading
up
to
the
implementation
of
sanctions
on
iran
that
would
cut
off
their
oil
exports
president
trump
persuaded
saudi
arabia
to
begin
pumping
more
oil
to
compensate
for
iran
s
pending
lost
just
before
sanctions
were
set
to
go
into
effect
president
trump
announced
that
waivers
would
be
given
to
a
number
of
countries
to
allow
them
to
continue
to
import
iranian
oil
among
those
countries
was
china
which
means
oil
producers
lost
business
to
iran
as
a
result
of
this
falloutsaudi
arabia
was
caught
off
guard
by
the
decision
to
grant
waivers
which
resulted
in
too
much
oil
in
the
market
the
price
of
oil
predictably
plunged
but
saudi
arabia
has
vowed
to
cut
production
they
are
also
working
with
other
countries
to
engineer
an
even
bigger
production
president
is
now
attempting
to
pacify
saudi
arabia
by
giving
the
country
a
pass
on
the
murder
of
dissident
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
in
october
and
by
publicly
thanking
them
on
twitter
but
that
will
be
unlikely
to
compensate
for
billions
in
lost
revenue
over
what
saudi
arabia
undoubtedly
considers
to
be
a
double
cross
related
saudi
oil
output
hits
record
high
in
novemberso
the
cost
of
lower
oil
prices
has
been
the
loss
of
a
growing
market
for
oil
producers
a
weakening
of
the
sanctions
against
iran
and
an
increase
in
mistrust
from
saudi
oil
prices
hurt
the
oil
industrypresident
trump
seems
to
have
a
blind
spot
on
oil
prices
that
might
have
been
appropriate
a
dozen
years
ago
when
the
was
a
net
importer
of
million
barrels
a
day
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
but
this
summer
net
imports
fell
to
just
under
two
million
barrels
a
day
and
they
are
on
a
trajectory
to
reach
zero
in
a
few
years
that
is
unless
we
enact
policies
that
hurt
the
oil
the
logic
of
the
tariffs
president
trump
has
pushed
yes
they
will
drive
up
prices
for
consumers
but
the
argument
is
that
it
will
ultimately
benefit
the
by
bringing
manufacturing
back
to
the
country
how
is
this
different
from
high
oil
prices
they
incentivize
oil
producers
which
lowers
our
dependence
on
foreign
oil
the
impact
on
consumers
seems
to
be
a
political
consideration
when
it
comes
to
gasoline
prices
but
not
on
all
of
the
products
that
are
being
affected
by
trump
has
an
outdated
view
on
oil
prices
and
one
that
is
inconsistent
with
his
logic
on
tariffs
if
he
wants
to
ensure
a
robust
oil
industry
that
could
increasingly
marginalize
saudi
arabia
s
influence
he
needs
to
stop
undermining
the
oil
