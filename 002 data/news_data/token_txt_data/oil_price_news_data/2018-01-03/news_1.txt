can norway survive without big oil?
supermajors
are
shunning
arctic
oil
exploration
in
norway
or
at
least
that
s
the
overwhelming
feeling
after
the
last
licensing
round
conducted
by
the
norwegian
petroleum
directorate
in
early
companies
applied
for
blocks
or
parts
of
blocks
of
which
almost
all
were
in
the
barents
sea
the
only
supermajor
in
the
crowd
was
shell
what
happened
more
than
half
of
norway
s
untapped
oil
and
gas
reserves
are
located
in
the
barents
sea
that
s
beyond
the
arctic
area
that
contains
an
estimated
billion
barrels
of
crude
and
trillion
cu
ft
of
natural
gas
in
total
norway
s
share
is
more
than
billion
barrels
of
undiscovered
likely
would
have
sounded
irresistible
five
years
ago
with
big
oil
always
on
the
hunt
for
projects
armed
with
the
means
to
afford
investing
in
them
no
more
now
to
and
including
the
likes
of
exxon
total
bp
chevron
and
quicker
and
higher

on

arctic
is
a
harsh
place
to
drill
the
climate
may
be
changing
but
not
enough
to
make
the
place
also
environmentalists
will
never
get
off
drillers
cases
so
that
s
some
additional
pressure
especially
now
in
november
environmental
organizations
took
the
norwegian
government
to
court
over
the
awarding
of
oil
drilling
licenses
in
the
arctic
and
argued
on
the
first
day
of
hearings
that
the
licenses
should
be
withdrawn
as
they
violate
norway
s
constitution
and
the
country
s
pledge
to
fulfill
the
terms
of
the
paris
climate
agreement
the
court
is
expected
to
rule
on
the
case
later
this
there
s
more
last
year
saw
a
record
number
of
exploration
wells
drilled
in
norway
s
section
of
the
barents
sea
but
only
one
of
them
yielded
a
commercially
viable
discovery
that
s
one
out
of
wells
drilled
it
s
also
not
large
enough
to
deserve
its
own
development
statoil
will
develop
the
discovery
as
part
of
its
johan
castberg
project
which
is
due
to
start
pumping
oil
in

that
s
not
all
in
the
bad
news
department
that
would
explain
why
big
oil
is
less
than
eager
to
tap
norway
s
arctic
oil
and
gas
wealth
the
most
anticipated
well
to
be
drilled
in
the
barents
sea
was
one
in
an
area
that
norway
calls
korpfjell
it
s
believed
to
hold
massive
oil
and
gas
reserves
but
the
only
thing
statoil
found
there
was
a
amount
of
natural
gas
all
this
is
enough
to
put
off
any
supermajor
looking
for
fast
profits

the

in
the
near
future
the
country
s
oil
production
is
currently
half
of
what
it
was
in
it
will
continue
to
decline
although
gas
production
is
growing
unless
more
discoveries
are
will
be
difficult
to
make
discoveries
without
big
oil
s
deep
pockets
but
statoil
isn
t
giving
up
it
s
planning
another
intense
drilling
campaign
for
this
year
because
its
