iran could add 100,000 bpd in “five or six days”
amid
positive
comments
from
opec
on
the
global
oil
supply
situation
and
indications
that
some
members
of
the
cartel
are
ready
for
a
longer
extension
of
the
production
cut
deal
iran
s
oil
minister
bijan
zanganeh
has
sparked
uncertainty
with
his
proclamation
that
iran
could
raise
its
oil
production
in
a
matter
of
days
should
opec
decide
to
scrap
the
deal
at
its
meeting
in
to
media
in
tehran
during
the
weekend
zanganeh
said
the
country
s
crude
oil
production
could
jump
by
bpd
within
five
or
six
days
should
the
cartel
decide
that
prices
are
high
enough
to
stop
curbing
its
has
been
talk
from
analysts
that
prices
may
be
getting
too
high
for
opec
s
and
russia
s
comfort
but
opec
officials
and
russia
s
alexander
novak
have
been
true
to
the
official
party
line
the
cuts
will
continue
to
the
end
of
the
latest
to
comment
on
the
state
of
affairs
was
opec
s
secretary
general
mohammed
barkindo
who
said
that
oecd
commercial
oil
inventories
have
steadily
fallen
to
stand
million
barrels
above
the
average
in
october
adding
that
our
determination
and
hard
work
are
paying
off
iran
was
allowed
to
cap
its
production
rather
than
cut
it
with
opec
even
allowing
it
a
slight
increase
of
bpd
to
million
bpd
but
according
to
bloomberg
data
last
month
iran
produced
less
than
that
at
million
bpd
the
country
also
recently
closed
two
oil
swap
deals
with
russia
and
iraq
and
as
analyst
ellen
wald
noted
in
a
recent
article
for
these
would
amount
to
a
combined
bpd
which
doesn
t
leave
a
lot
of
free
production
capacity
to
match
zanganeh
s
statement
related
lng
glut
today
shortage
tomorrowof
course
iran
is
far
from
the
most
transparent
country
so
the
minister
may
well
know
something
the
rest
of
the
world
doesn
t
on
the
other
hand
over
the
first
ten
months
of
this
fiscal
year
iran
s
oil
and
condensate
production
already
rose
by
bpd
also
according
to
the
minister
that
s
a
increase
over
ten
months
it
s
difficult
to
believe
iran
has
the
resources
to
add
another
bpd
in
just
a
few
s
more
the
chances
of
opec
ending
the
deal
prematurely
seem
remote
they
may
draw
closer
in
the
coming
months
if
producers
continue
to
ramp
up
production
at
the
current
rate
which
prompted
the
energy
information
administration
to
revise
upwards
its
forecasts
for
this
year
and
next
now
the
eia
expects
production
to
hit
the
million
bpd
mark
later
this
year
reaching
an
average
million
in
that
s
not
all
now
american
oil
has
flowed
to
the
middle
east
and
more
specifically
the
uae
if
something
like
this
something
as
unthinkable
as
this
can
happen
then
opec
can
t
feel
safe
even
on
its
home
turf
which
could
lead
to
some
decision
changes
by
certainly
wants
the
deal
gone
so
it
can
continue
growing
its
production
especially
as
its
crude
enjoys
a
rally
that
has
pushed
it
close
to
the
price
of
brent
so
zanganeh
is
gladly
stoking
the
fire
under
his
fellow
opec
members
if
we
want
to
make
a
decision
it
has
to
be
at
the
right
time
which
is
june
when
we
ll
next
meet
he
said
but
my
impression
is
that
opec
members
are
not
after
very
expensive
oil
because
very
expensive
oil
leads
to
price
