oil market makes major shift as us oil heads to middle east
a
cargo
of
condensate
has
reached
abu
dhabi
in
the
latest
sign
how
much
the
oil
market
has
changed
in
the
last
few
years
the
cargo
bloomberg
reports
was
bought
in
december
from
enterprise
product
partners
this
is
the
first
cargo
to
be
shipped
to
the
middle
the
news
is
significant
inasmuch
as
it
indicates
the
united
states
strengthening
position
on
international
oil
markets
it
is
unlikely
that
condensate
imports
into
the
uae
will
become
a
regular
thing
according
to
at
least
one
head
of
lipow
oil
associates
andy
lipow
told
bloomberg
that
as
a
member
of
opec
and
a
large
crude
producer
i
would
imagine
they
would
be
very
in
their
own
crude
yet
its
condensate
supply
came
mostly
from
qatar
before
the
blockade
in
which
the
uae
also
took
an
active
part
as
a
firm
supporter
of
the
uae
produced
around
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
in
january
in
line
with
its
production
quota
under
the
opec
supply
cut
deal
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
energy
minister
announced
the
state
oil
company
adnoc
will
further
reduce
production
to
comply
with
the
deal
related
bp
has
its
most
successful
year
this
decademeanwhile
production
is
growing
and
the
latest
energy
outlook
by
the
energy
information
administration
projects
the
daily
average
to
reach
million
bpd
earlier
than
previously
expected
the
eia
said
this
year
the
will
produce
an
average
of
million
bpd
rising
to
million
bpd
next
oil
exports
are
on
the
rise
as
well
last
month
the
eia
reports
these
averaged
million
bpd
versus
half
this
amount
a
year
earlier
this
increase
was
one
of
the
factors
that
supported
oil
prices
in
late
as
it
led
to
drawdowns
in
oil
inventories
