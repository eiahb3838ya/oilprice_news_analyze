u.s. oil production is rising much faster than expected
shale
executives
have
gone
to
great
lengths
to
convince
investors
that
they
will
not
drill
aggressively
now
that
oil
prices
have
rallied
into
the
but
in
a
new
report
released
on
tuesday
the
eia
essentially
said
that
those
assurances
are
just
a
lot
of
hot
eia
s
energy
outlook
predicted
that
oil
production
would
top
million
barrels
per
day
this
year
last
month
the
agency
said
that
the
wouldn
t
hit
that
threshold
until
november
revision
from
just
a
few
weeks
ago
is
dramatic
in
january
the
eia
estimated
that
the
would
surpass
at
some
point
in
february
but
recently
published
data
shows
that
the
actually
hit
that
milestone
last
november
and
now
the
agency
says
the
actually
averaged
in
an
annual
basis
the
produced
last
year
a
figure
that
is
set
to
jump
to
for
things
slow
down
a
bit
in
with
an
average
of
do
we
make
of
all
of
this
well
the
shale
industry
is
clearly
drilling
at
a
frenzied
pace
with
an
increasing
concentration
in
the
permian
basin
the
rig
count
continues
to
rise
in
the
permian
while
remaining
mostly
flat
elsewhere
so
far
the
permian
has
shown
no
signs
of
slowing
down
despite
some
evidence
of
bottlenecking
and
cost
inflation
production
continues
to
rise
at
a
scorching
rate
related
oil
prices
fall
on
rising
crude
inventoriesthe
big
question
at
this
point
is
how
rapidly
expanding
shale
production
will
interact
with
the
pace
of
inventory
and
the
opec
production
limits
some
analysts
including
goldman
sachs
and
s
p
global
platts
recently
raised
the
prospect
of
opec
tightening
the
oil
market
too
much
allowing
inventories
to
drain
well
below
the
massive
upward
revision
in
shale
production
from
the
eia
might
dampen
those
concerns
the
eia
says
that
inventories
will
build
by
an
average
of
over
the
course
of
and
and
the
agency
predicts
brent
will
average
just
per
barrel
this
global
financial
turmoil
is
testing
oil
prices
wti
and
brent
have
retreated
from
recent
highs
over
the
last
few
trading
days
dragged
down
by
the
global
selloff
the
enormous
build
up
in
bullish
bets
from
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
presents
a
deeper
downside
goldman
sachs
shrugged
off
the
instability
and
reiterated
its
bullish
case
for
commodities
for
this
year
in
fact
the
selloff
increases
the
odds
of
more
gains
in
the
months
ahead
goldman
analysts
argue
commodities
proved
to
work
just
as
advertised
during
the
sudden
selloff
in
equities
jeffrey
currie
the
bank
s
head
of
commodities
research
said
in
a
bloomberg
television
interview
in
fact
you
saw
base
metals
and
gold
trade
up
as
the
equity
market
went
related
the
world
s
biggest
oil
benchmark
could
change
forever
historically
when
you
look
at
commodities
they
perform
very
well
during
cycles
currie
said
oil
s
what
we
called
backwardated
where
spot
prices
sit
above
forward
prices
so
you
buy
at
a
discount
and
roll
up
the
curve
in
other
words
it
pays
you
to
be
the
investment
bank
says
there
is
no
reason
to
abandon
the
bullish
case
for
commodities
for
this
year
goldman
predicts
brent
will
top
per
barrel
within
six
that
is
the
case
then
surely
the
shale
industry
will
accelerate
drilling
after
all
the
eia
sees
the
industry
adding
upwards
of
between
january
and
it
might
be
too
soon
to
tell
if
shale
drillers
are
going
to
abandon
those
claims
of
restraint
goldman
sachs
said
in
a
research
note
that
the
most
recent
spending
plans
and
guidance
published
by
a
select
few
shale
drillers
does
not
necessarily
point
to
a
mentality
goldman
looked
at
shale
companies
that
released
specifics
and
the
capex
and
production
estimates
from
those
companies
are
about
equal
to
consensus
estimates
in
other
words
the
recent
rally
in
oil
prices
has
not
significantly
altered
the
approach
of
the
shale
industry
for
at
least
not
eia
s
latest
prediction
however
assumes
the
shale
industry
throws
caution
to
the
wind
the
could
hit
in
a
full
year
earlier
than
previously
