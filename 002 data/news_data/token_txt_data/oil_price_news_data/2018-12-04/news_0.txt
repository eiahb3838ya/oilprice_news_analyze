the most likely outcome of the opec meeting
the
meeting
is
set
to
kickoff
with
a
press
conference
scheduled
for
thursday
afternoon
in
vienna
while
there
seems
to
be
a
vague
outline
of
an
agreement
in
hand
there
is
still
quite
a
bit
of
uncertainty
about
what
might
come
out
of
the
oil
minister
khalid
injected
a
bit
more
uncertainty
into
the
market
with
his
comments
in
a
tuesday
interview
with
bloomberg
he
said
that
russia
supports
production
restraints
in
principle
but
that
it
would
be
premature
to
say
what
specifically
they
might
agree
to
he
even
said
that
still
needs
to
figure
out
what
needs
to
be
done
and
by
how
while
there
is
always
a
bit
of
jawboning
and
word
games
ahead
of
any
opec
meeting
the
comments
suggest
that
there
is
still
some
disagreement
over
the
specifics
we
need
to
get
together
and
listen
to
our
colleagues
hear
about
their
views
on
supply
and
demand
and
their
projections
of
their
own
countries
production
said
the
next
road
to
cross
is
whether
all
countries
are
willing
to
come
on
board
and
contribute
to
that
saudi
arabia
s
inclination
is
to
cut
aggressively
but
it
also
does
not
want
to
anger
president
donald
trump
who
has
bailed
the
saudis
out
on
the
khashoggi
affair
was
notably
more
circumspect
regarding
a
production
cut
on
tuesday
than
he
was
only
a
few
weeks
ago
when
he
announced
that
saudi
arabia
would
unilaterally
lower
exports
beginning
in
december
between
then
and
now
the
senate
passed
a
bill
ending
american
support
for
the
saudi
war
in
yemen
significantly
upping
the
pressure
on
saudi
arabia
not
to
cut
by
too
much
related
what
crashing
refining
margins
mean
for
oil
marketsmeanwhile
riyadh
still
needs
to
convince
moscow
to
some
degree
even
though
russian
president
vladimir
putin
said
that
he
was
on
board
bloomberg
reports
that
russia
only
wants
to
cut
output
by
bpd
a
rather
modest
amount
which
would
mean
more
heavy
lifting
by
saudi
arabia
to
balance
the
market
russia
appears
willing
to
go
along
with
some
sort
of
reduction
but
it
also
does
not
feel
the
same
urgency
as
the
saudis
particularly
because
of
the
dynamics
of
how
its
currency
fluctuates
with
oil
prices
making
lower
prices
much
less
painful
compared
to
saudi
if
saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
not
quite
on
the
same
page
regarding
the
size
of
the
cut
and
how
to
share
the
reductions
most
analysts
see
some
sort
of
deal
emerging
from
thursday
s
meeting
in
fact
even
though
russia
is
not
a
price
hawk
in
the
same
way
that
saudi
arabia
is
moscow
can
gain
from
the
damaged
relationship
between
washington
and
having
stayed
largely
silent
on
the
khashoggi
case
moscow
has
an
opportunity
to
strengthen
relations
with
riyadh
further
if
it
accommodates
saudi
arabia

principal

wrote
in
a
note
to

an
agreement
led
by
saudi
arabia
and
russia
that
openly
defies
the
us
is
unlikely
but
we
believe
riyadh
has
a
good
chance
of
securing

said
that
the
consultancy
s
basecase
scenario
is
a
cut
with
russian
participation
but
a
flexible
agreement
that
shies
away
from
specific
individual
countries
may
not
have
specific
targets
instead
a
collective
target
could
be
the
main
is
important
verisk
maplecroft
argues
because
the
oil
market
could
undergo
another
dramatic
shift
in
just
a
few
months
time
another
benefit
of
this
approach
is
that
it
reduces
the
likelihood
of
another
opec
if
the
trump
administrations
decides
to
not
renew
iran
waivers
expiring

may
soltvedt

wrote
with
around
million

of
iranian
oil
in
the
balance
a
rigid
opec
agreement
in
the
traditional
mold
risks
quickly
being
overtaken
by
events
in
the
trump
administration
mainly
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
and
national
security
advisor
john
bolton
are
eager
to
tighten
the
screws
on
iran
in
october
as
the
was
in
the
midst
of
preparing
to
issue
waivers
for
eight
countries
importing
oil
from
iran
the
oil
market
looked
precariously
tight
the
ensuing
price
crash
no
doubt
made
worse
by
the
waivers
themselves
has
revealed
a
market
much
looser
than
means
that
by
may
the
trump
administration
will
likely
want
to
let
most
of
those
waivers
expire
the
result
could
be
much
more
iranian
supply
knocked
offline
saudi
arabia
and
russia
need
to
account
for
this
possibility
at
thursday
s
meeting
in
vienna

as
