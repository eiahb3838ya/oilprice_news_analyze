the texas oil boom isn’t creating enough jobs
texas
is
witnessing
a
fresh
oil
boom
with
june
production
hitting
million
bpd
all
thanks
to
two
things
efficiency
improvements
and
of
course
oil
prices
but
not
everyone
is
happy
about
this
the
higher
efficiency
means
that
fewer
new
jobs
are
is
one
of
the
takeaways
from
the
latest
texas
petro
index
from
the
texas
alliance
of
energy
producers
as
presented
by
oil
economist
karr
production
over
the
months
to
june
ingham
said
rose
by
an
impressive
percent
and
while
not
a
priority
for
drillers
in
the
state
natural
gas
production
has
also
increased
yet
it
is
taking
fewer
rigs
to
pump
more
oil
and
also
fewer
oil
price
collapse
of
forced
producers
to
bet
on
efficiency
on
doing
more
with
less
and
now
they
are
reaping
the
fruits
of
their
labor
they
have
learned
how
to
boost
production
from
one
single
well
without
adding
more
rigs
they
have
also
learned
to
make
longer
horizontal
part
of
the
well
in
the
shale
they
have
learned
to
pump
more
sand
and
chemicals
into
these
has
led
to
lower
demand
for
workers
as
reflected
in
the
texas
petro
index
as
of
june
the
number
of
direct
upstream
jobs
in
the
texas
oil
industry
totaled
some
new
jobs
were
added
after
the
crisis
which
had
wiped
out
as
many
as
jobs
although
job
creation
will
continue
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
chances
are
it
will
continue
at
the
same
slow
pace
compared
with
production
the
not
so
good
news
about
oil
jobs
texas
continues
to
reign
supreme
in
oil
and
gas
as
of
june
the
lone
star
state
produced
percent
of
the
nation
s
total
oil
output
and
percent
of
its
natural
gas
output
more
than
half
of
active
drilling
rigs
in
the
united
states
are
in
texas
and
almost
percent
of
direct
upstream
jobs
are
there

the
flip
side
of
the
permian
oil
boomdrilling
permits
are
down
from
last
year
but
well
completions
are
up
and
considerably
by
percent
the
value
of
oil
produced
is
also
substantially
higher
thanks
to
the
improvement
in
international
prices
however
texas
drillers
have
their
woes
as
well
and
price
is
one
of
problem
stems
from
a
pipeline
shortage
in
the
permian
that
has
forced
local
drillers
to
sell
their
crude
at
a
discount
to
get
it
to
discount
that
saw
midland
crude
trade
us
a
barrel
lower
than

the
international
benchmark
this
pipeline
shortage
was
a
result
of
the
quick
expansion
of
production
in
the
prolific
basin
after
the
permian
which
produced
the
bulk
of
texas
oil
output
at
million
bpd
in
june
has
some
of
the
acreage
which
spurred
an
oil
rush
there
over
the
last
three
years
the
rush
is
paying
off
in
terms
of
production
as
evidenced
by
the
latest
texas
alliance
figures
but
both
the
pipeline
shortage
and
the
slow
job
growth
continue
to
hang
over
