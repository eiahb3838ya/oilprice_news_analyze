big oilâ€™s trillion dollar data battle
the
faster
oil
services
firms
and
oil
exploration
companies
adopt
digitalization
the
more
data
they
generate
with
every
well
they
drill
and
every
digital
map
of
oil
resources
they
that
data
is
now
the
subject
of
hot
debate
as
the
oil
industry
tries
to
figure
out
who
owns
that
the
era
of
the
internet
of
things
iot
and
the
internet
of
everything
ioe
data
about
oil
resources
and
oil
wells
is
so
important
that
companies
across
the
oil
industry
s
chain
are
now
seeking
to
explicitly
state
in
contracts
who
owns
that
oil
service
firms
or
their
exploration
the
one
hand
oilfield
service
companies
have
realized
how
valuable
the
data
they
get
can
be
while
on
the
other
hand
the
e
p
companies
say
they
own
everything
coming
out
of
their
wells
including
the
data
this
is
setting
the
stage
for
a
battle
over
the
other
most
valuable
resource
in
the
oil
industry
bloomberg
s
david
wethe
and
digitalization
have
transformed
many
industries
including
oil
and
gas
and
they
will
continue
to
do
so
creating
billions
of
dollars
from
the
businesses
of
big
data
analytics
and
digital
oil
early
as
in
cisco
consulting
services
and
oxford
economics
said
in
research
that
the
oil
and
gas
industry
adopting
ioe
has
the
potential
to
increase
global
gdp
by
up
to
us
cisco
consulting
services
estimated
that
the
adoption
cost
of
the
ioe
would
be
about
us
billion
for
the
industry
but
over
a
period
the
multiplier
impact
would
be
about
three
to
four
times
when
it
s
translated
to
the
global
economy
related
opec
doubles
down
on
draining
oil
inventoriesanother
key
insight
from
the
research
was
that
oil
and
gas
leaders
named
data
analytics
for
faster
better
as
their
driver
to
invest
in
ioe
more
recently
the
accenture
and
microsoft
upstream
oil
and
gas
digital
trends
survey
showed
that
in
years
over
percent
of
more
than
leading
upstream
companies
plan
more
or
significantly
more
investment
transitioning
to
areas
such
as
computing
wearables
artificial
intelligence
ai
robotics
blockchain
and
mixed
the
battle
over
who
owns
the
exponentially
rising
amount
of
data
has
made
companies
carefully
word
their
service
contracts
to
explicitly
state
who
owns
what
including
it
was
always
pretty
straightforward
and
there
was
never
really
a
lot
of
conversation
about
it
garrett
jackson
vice
president
of
drilling
and
completions
at
devon
energy
told
bloomberg
in
an
now
the
clauses
are
getting
to
be
a
page
page
and
a
half
long
trying
to
parse
out
what
parts
are
the
contractor
what
parts
are
the
operator
when
there
s
overlap
how
that
s
divided
up
jackson
service
companies
could
sell
digital
libraries
with
the
data
they
have
thus
boosting
their

at

holt
co
who
previously
ran
the
business
for
halliburton
told
bloomberg
imagine
that
all
data
is
like
a
movie
that
many
different
people
want
to
watch
but
they
want
to
watch
it
at
different
related
natural
gas
is
under

e
p
firms
increasingly
believe
that
it
s
their
data
to
analyze
and
that
data
is
one
of
their
most
valuable
resources
to
help
them
make
faster
decisions
and

data
is
king
and
one
of
our
most
valuable

sandeep
bhakhri

said
at
a
conference
call
last

you
have
to
own
the

you
can
not
outsource
its
collection
analysis
or
delivery
said
bhakhri
whose
employer
eog
has
been
dubbed
the
apple
of
oil
by
analysts
because
of
its
use
of
technology
and
data
analytics
eog
has
dozens
of
apps
it
has
developed
to
help

track

it
has
been
analyzing

calls
black

that
it

been
deploying

in

data
in
the

is
nearly
as
valuable
as

itself

companies
are
boosting
