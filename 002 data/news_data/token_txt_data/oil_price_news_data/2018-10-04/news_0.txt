the no.1 pitfall for oil prices
one
of
the
few
variables
that
could
spoil
the
oil
prices
which
many
see
destined
to
climb
higher
is
the
pitfalls
facing
global
synchronized
growth
already
came
to
an
end
earlier
this
year
although
the
is
still
going
strong
however
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
long
that
can
last
with
the
juice
from
the
tax
cuts
set
to
wear
off
tariffs
raising
consumer
prices
a
rise
in
retail
gasoline
prices
and
interest
rates
grinding
the
real
danger
to
global
oil
demand
is
higher
oil
prices
themselves
which
to
be
sure
isn
t
exactly
a
revelatory
conclusion
however
while
brent
crude
surged
to
per
barrel
up
from
the
at
the
start
of
the
year
the
price
increase
is
astronomically
higher
in
emerging
markets
where
currency
weakness
has
wreaked
instance
in
brazil
the
real
has
lost
around
percent
of
its
value
this
year
a
plunge
that
occurred
at
the
same
time
that
oil
prices
were
rising
the
punch
has
translated
into
soaring
prices
for
fuel
bloomberg
notes
that
in
brazilian
reais
oil
prices
are
now
sharply
above
the
record
high
for
oil
prices
and
not
just
by
a
little
bit
prices
are
percent
higher
than
that
peak
it
s
no
wonder
that
the
country
was
crippled
by
fuel
protests
a
few
months
ago
a
series
of
events
that
forced
the
government
to
backtrack
on
market
reforms
for
fuel
prices
motorists
may
complain
about
higher
prices
at
the
pump
but
they
have
no
story

a

prices
in

are
also

obrador

looked
at

no
stranger
to
protests
over
fuel
is
also
seeing
unease
the
government
is
hoping
to
stick
to
its
fuel
pricing
reforms
but
next
year
s
presidential
election
is
putting
the
modi
government
under
a
lot
of
strain

matters
because
the

is
mostly
flat
in
the
and
while
it
is
easy
to
observe
the
fact
that

prices
have
skyrocketed

the
hard
part
is
trying
to
figure
out
how

sensitive

this
may
have
been
an
anomaly

grew
at
its

rate
in
over
a

w
do
not
expect

it
would

it
is
hard
to
ignore
a
growing
number
of
economic
problems
inflation

rose

again
in
september
and
is
up
near
its
highest
level
during

that
comes
despite

the
inability

prompt

push
the
