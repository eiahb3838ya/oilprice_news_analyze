is the threat of high oil prices overstated?
as
sanctions
on
iran
have
forced
some
countries
to
stop
importing
oil
from
iran
crude
oil
prices
have
inevitably
risen
the
started
down
this
path
earlier
this
year
when
president
trump
announced
the
withdrawal
from
the
iran
nuclear
sanctions
went
into
effect
in
august
but
the
sanctions
with
potentially
the
most
significant
global
implications
go
into
effect
in
november
when
the
sanctions
target
iran
s
oil
may
of
this
year
iran
exported
million
barrels
of
oil
per
day
which
accounted
for
nearly
of
the
world
s
daily
crude
oil
consumption
the
new
sanctions
are
expected
to
impact
about
million
bpd
of
iran
s
pressure
from
the
many
countries
have
begun
to
reduce
oil
exports
from
iran
as
the
market
has
slowly
absorbed
the
implications
of
this
loss
crude
oil
prices
have
steadily
risen
as
recently
as
august
a
barrel
of
brent
crude
oil
was
still
in
the
upper
today
the
price
has
risen
to
a
high
west
texas
intermediate
is
now
over
was
entirely
predictable
the
world
simply
does
not
currently
have
a
lot
of
spare
crude
oil
capacity
but
there
is
a
widespread
belief
that
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
exporting
countries
opec
has
excess
capacity
that
can
be
used
to
offset
the
loss
of
iranian
fact
president
trump
has
tweeted
his
ire
at
opec
on
several
occasions
most
recently
on
september
when
he
wrote
we
protect
the
countries
of
the
middle
east
they
would
not
be
safe
for
very
long
without
us
and
yet
they
continue
to
push
for
higher
and
higher
oil
prices
we
will
remember
the
opec
monopoly
must
get
prices
down
now
related
what
drove
brent
above
saudi
arabia
claims
about
million
bpd
of
spare
capacity
but
that
would
take
their
production
to
an
high
a
number
of
people
have
asked
if
i
believe
their
claim
yes
i
think
they
do
have
some
excess
capacity
but
the
bulk
of
that
is
reserved
for
true
emergencies
high
oil
prices
do
not
constitute
an
true
emergency
would
be
the
outbreak
of
violence
in
a
major
country
that
took
millions
of
barrels
offline
in
other
words
a
sudden
unexpected
event
that
rocks
that
oil
saudi
arabia
and
russia
rebuffed
president
trump
s
request
saudi
energy
minister
khalid
stated
the
markets
are
adequately
supplied
i
don
t
know
of
any
refiner
in
the
world
who
is
looking
for
oil
and
is
not
able
to
get
privately
saudi
arabia
is
expected
to
increase
production
somewhat
to
offset
iran
s
lost
barrels
it
won
t
be
enough
to
make
up
for
all
of
iran
s
lost
exports
and
it
will
put
the
world
in
a
more
precarious
situation
in
case
of
a
real
emergency
but
it
may
be
enough
to
stave
off
a
quick
return
