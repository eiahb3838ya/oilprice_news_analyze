but
noted
that
sanctions
tariffs
and
the
withdrawal
from
the
iran

point
to

opec
revised
up
its
global
oil
demand
growth
estimate
by
bpd
from
the
april
report
to
million
bpd
the
upward
revision
was
mainly
the
result
of
firm
oecd
data
for
the
first
quarter
of
data
from
asia
including
india
and
latin
america
also
prompted
opec
to
revise

expected
to
lead

this

the

revised
the

marginally
higher
compared

year
on
year
in
global
economic
growth
however
opec
pointed
out
that
the
of
potentially
disruptive
concerns
has
increased
citing
the
latest
sanctions
on
russia
tariffs
on
chinese
products
in
combination
with
considerable
requests
by
the
in
trade
negotiations
with
china

north
american
free

agreement
nafta
negotiations
and
the
withdrawal
from
the

comprehensive
plan
of

jcpoa
with
in
conclusion
global
growth
momentum
seems
to
be
well
established
in
the
and
the
most
recent
weakness
seen
mainly
in
some
oecd
economies
may
only
be
temporary
major
emerging
economies
growth
dynamics
have
thus
far
counterbalanced
this
soft
spot
and
global
growth
may
recover
in
the
remainder
of
the
year
due
to
us
fiscal
stimulus
and
a
rebound
in
oecd
growth
however
after
a
period
of
a
considerable
growth
uncertainties
seem
to
be
on
the
rise
