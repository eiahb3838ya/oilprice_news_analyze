permian bottlenecks come at the worst moment
the
growing
number
of
supply
outages
around
the
world
are
causing
the
oil
market
to
become
a
lot
more
volatile
putting
extra
emphasis
on
every
barrel
that
does
or
does
not
make
it
to
market
that
makes
the

bottlenecks
in

a
global
is
quite
a
bit
of
debate
about
what
s
going
on
in
the
permian
and
whether
or
not
the
shale
industry
will
be
able
to
keep
up
with
heady
production
forecasts
the

predicts
the
will
add
million
barrels
per
day
in
followed
by
another
in
the
bulk
of
that
is
expected
to
come
from
the
permian
and
while
the
iea
acknowledges
pipeline
bottlenecks
in
the
permian
it
has
not
significantly
altered
its
supply
forecast
while
producers
are
bumping
up
against
pipeline
bottlenecks
supplies
will
continue
to
rise

but
by
most
accounts
the
pipelines
from
the
permian
to
the
gulf
coast
are
either
full
or
will
be
full
in
the
next
few
months
that

projections
like
the
ones
from
places
like
the
iea
look
a
bit
optimistic
almost
as
if

more
pessimistic
we
will
reach
capacity
in
the
next

months
scott
sheffield
the
chairman
of
pioneer
natural
resources
told
bloomberg
last
month
some
companies
will
have
to
shut
in
production
some
companies
will
move
rigs
away
and
some
companies
will
be
able
to
continue
growing
because
they
have
firm
transportation
the
permian
has
roughly
of
takeaway
capacity
plus
local
refining
capacity
there
is
theoretically
some
bpd
of
train
capacity
but
a
lot
of
that
is
being
used
to
move

suggests
that
some
oil
could
be
moved
by
trucks
but
that
is
an
incredibly
expensive
option
it
s
a
trip
and
on
the
low
side
it
s
at
least
per
barrel
probably
more
like
to
trip
rogers
a

manager
at

told
he
added
that
shipping
oil
by
pipeline
only
adds

about
bpd
is
moving
by
truck
and
that
figure
could
be
capped
at
bpd
because
of
constraints
on
trucking
according
to
s
p
global
platts
there
is
already
a
nationwide
shortage
of
truckers
and
the
cost
of
moving
oil
hundreds
of
miles
from
west
texas
to
the
coast
means
that
trucking
is
ultimately
not
really
a
viable
solution
in
any
big
a
result
the
pipeline
bottleneck
will
become
more
acute
as
the
year
wears
on
by
the
end
of
permian
production
could
exceed
available
pipeline
space
by
to
bpd
according
to
bp
capital
fund
advisors
by
late
the
gap
could
reach
hefty
discount
could
deter
well
completions
indeed
the
number
of
drilled
but
uncompleted
wells
continues
to
rise
by
with
each
passing
month
topping
in
bp
capital
fund
advisors
argues
that
the
beating
that
permian
shale
drillers
have
taken
in
terms
of
their
share
prices
is
overly
severe
and
particularly
short
sighted
due
to
the
temporary
nature
of
the
bottleneck
and
the
attractiveness
of
stacked
pay
zones
in
the
permian
which
make
drilling
much
more
profitable
than
elsewhere
related
what
trump
s
tweet
actually
means
for
oilin
the
short
run
however
the
constraints
mean
that
some
companies
are
starting
to
pivot
away
from
the
permian
basin
we
have
seen
that
a
bit
yeah
and
i
think
that
s
logical
for
those
companies
to
have
those
options
it
does
make
sense
we
have
seen
that
in
some
areas
we
have
seen
some
rigs

from

although
its
retreat
will
be
temporary

in

according
to
s
p
global
platts
overall
the
permian
has
lost
four
rigs
since
late
may
while
the
eagle
ford
has
gained
out
the
troubles
in
the
permian
will
be
felt
worldwide
because
so
many
oil
market
forecasts
assume
large
growth
from
the
permian
the
notion
that
shale
will
undershoot
expectations
could
present
upside
risk
to
oil
prices
it
s
a
big

i
think
it
played
