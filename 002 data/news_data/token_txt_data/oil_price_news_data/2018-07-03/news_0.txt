the new oil cartel threatening opec
when
reports
emerged
that
india
and
china
are
in
talks
about
forming
an
oil
buyers
club
opec
was
probably
too
busy
with
its
upcoming
june
meeting
to
concern
itself
with
that
dangerous
alliance
now
it
may
be
time
for
it
to
start
the
timing
is
right
the
boom
in
oil
and
gas
production
gives
us
greater
leverage
against
opec
the
times
of
india
quoted
an
indian
official
as
saying
last
month
after
the
formal
start
of
said
talks
the
two
countries
after
all
account
for
a
combined
percent
of
global
oil
consumption
and
they
are
the
ones
that
would
be
the
hardest
hit
if
prices
rise
as
a
result
of
opec
s
s
more
they
might
not
be
alone
in
this
attempt
to
curb
opec
s
clout
on
the
global
oil
market
according
to
bloomberg
s
carl
pope
europe
and
japan
previously
reluctant
to
take
part
in
any
projects
may
now
join
in
the
reason
they
are
likely
to
join
in
is
that
unlike
in
previous
oil
price
cycles
now
there
are
alternatives
to
fossil
fuels
electrification
is
where
opec
may
have
to
face
off
with
a
future
oil
buyers
china
and
europe
are
all
very
big
on
ev
adoption
japan
is
a
leader
in
battery
manufacturing
if
they
set
their
minds
to
it
these
four
players
could
upend
the
oil
market
and
effectively
cripple
opec
of
course
this
is
a
scenario
of
the
kind
that
rarely
unfolds
in
reality
related
why
oil
prices
are
surginglet
s
take
india
for
example
a
recent
survey
suggested
that
as
many
as
percent
of
indian
drivers
were
willing
to
switch
to
evs
if
the
government
built
the
necessary
charging
infrastructure
reduced
road
taxes
and
increased
subsidies
another
survey
identified
price
and
range
as
additional
roadblocks
towards
the
mass
adoption
of
evs
in
india
because
of
these
challenges
new
delhi
recently
amended
its
ambitious
goal
of
having
an
fleet
on
the
roads
of
the
country
by
to
having
percent
of
the
fleet
for
its
part
is
the
undisputed
leader
in
global
ev
adoption
the
country
accounted
for
more
than
percent
of
global
ev
sales
last
year
in
case
you
were
thinking
wait
wasn
t
that
norway
however
this
was
in
large
part
made
possible
by
generous
government
subsidies
for
ev
manufacturing
these
subsidies
are
due
to
be
wound
down
to
by
and
carmakers
are
already
beginning
to
brace
for
a
future
without
the
support
of
the
state
it
s
safe
to
say
it
remains
uncertain
if
the
ev
boom
will
continue
after
precarious
situation
with
evs
is
reason
enough
for
china
and
india
to
seek
more
clout
on
international
oil
markets
dominated
by
opec
and
would
justify
the
formation
of
a
buyers
europe
for
its
part
is
as
a
whole
a
top
performer
in
ev
adoption
and
it
is
also
very
big
on
environmentalism
at
the
same
time
it
still
imports
crude
and
quite
a
lot
of
it
so
it
cares
about
oil
prices
as
a
large
buyer
related
stranded
bp
cargoes
a
red
flag
for
chinese
oil
demand
china
and
india
are
facing
challenges
in
ev
adoption
europe
could
help
and
benefit
from
it
after
all
taken
together
europe
china
india
and
japan
account
for
the
manufacturing
of
as
much
as
percent
of
the
world
s
cars
and
a
lot
of
these
are
manufactured
in
europe
these
four
also
consume
percent
of
the
world
s
crude
oil
and
would
like
to
reduce
this
to
pope
if
they
get
together
they
would
be
able
to
negotiate
either
a
more
gradual
or
a
faster
shift
to
evs
it
would
all
depend
on
whether
opec
would
agree
to
maintain
lower
prices
or
more
skeptical
view
would
note
the
challenges
in
ev
adoption
such
as
subsidies
and
infrastructure
these
would
take
time
to
be
overcome
even
if
everyone
played
together
yet
an
oil
buyers
alliance
could
be
a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
by
the
oil
producers
and
the
latter
need
to
start
paying
attention
