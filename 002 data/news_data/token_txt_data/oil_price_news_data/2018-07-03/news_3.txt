opec production jumps in june as saudis near production record
opec
s
oil
production
in
june
increased
by
bpd
from
may
to
stand
at
million
bpd
as
the
cartel
s
biggest
producer
saudi
arabia
produced
volumes
according
to
a
monthly
reuters
survey
tracking
oil
supply
to
the
arabia
s
oil
production
in
june
surged
by
bpd
to
million
bpd
very
close
to
its
production
of
million
bpd
from
november
a
reuters
survey
showed
in
a
clear
sign
that
opec
s
leader
had
started
boosting
production
before
the
june
meeting
and
is
making
up
for
supply
drops
elsewhere
within
the
arabia
interprets
the
vague
opec
statement
from
the
june
meeting
to
ease
compliance
rates
as
implying
that
there
will
be
indirectly
a
reallocation
of
quotas
within
the
cartel
the
main
saudi
rival
in
the
middle
east
iran
strongly
disagrees
that
opec
members
should
be
allowed
to
make
up
for
production
losses
in
other
nations
and
publicly
criticized
saudi
arabia
for
boosting
to
the
reuters
survey
the
saudi
allies
in
the
uae
and
steady
production
in
june
compared
to
may
so
they
have
yet
to
increase
production
following
the
saudi
collective
implied
production
ceiling
for
opec
for
this
year
is
million
bpd
so
even
with
the
higher
june
production
the
cartel
s
compliance
rate
is
still
above
percent
to
be
precise
down
from
percent
in
may
the

survey
