significant crude build weighs on oil markets
the
energy
information
administration
reported
a
huge
crude
oil
inventory
build
for
the
week
to
november
of
million
barrels
arresting
an
improvement
in
oil
prices
that
started
yesterday
after
a
sharp
drop
earlier
this
growing
concern
about
a
weakening
in
global
oil
demand
and
rising
production
from
opec
and
outside
it
notably
in
the
united
states
the
eia
also
reported
a
decline
in
gasoline
inventories
and
another
one
of
million
barrels
in
distillate
fuel
million
barrels
daily
gasoline
production
last
week
was
considerably
higher
than
the
million
bpd
booked
a
week
earlier
distillate
fuel
production
averaged
million
bpd
virtually
unchanged
on
a
week
processed
million
barrels
daily
last
week
the
eia
said
another
flat
figure
on
a
weekly
is
coming
and
demand
for
crude
and
fuels
would
normally
weaken
pressuring
prices
in
this
sense
the
eia
latest
weekly
report
out
from
normal
seasonal
demand
patterns
yet
its
effect
on
prices
is
likely
to
be
excessive
amid
heightened
volatility
resulting
from
two
new
reports
with
a
pessimistic
outlook
for
global
demand
from
the
international
energy
agency
and
iea
and
opec
expect
slower
demand
growth
than
they
did
earlier
this
year
mostly
on
the
back
of
slower
global
economic
growth
yet
there
is
also
worry
about
oversupply
resulting
once
again
from
the
relentless
increase
in
crude
oil
production
which
two
weeks
ago
hit
million
barrels
daily
and
will
likely
continued
higher
last
week
as
well
as
drillers
added
more
the
time

at

a

up
modestly
from
yesterday
s
close
after
earlier
this
week
plunging
close
to
us
a
barrel
under
the
double
blow
of
rising
supplies
and
a
call
from
president
trump
to
opec
to
refrain
from
production

at

a
barrel
also
recouping
some
of
the
losses
it
suffered
earlier
this

almost
directly
after
markets
digested
the
biggest
crude
build
in
months
