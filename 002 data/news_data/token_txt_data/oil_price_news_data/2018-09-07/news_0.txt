the downside for oil is limited
more
than
two
weeks
of
nearly
uninterrupted
price
gains
for
crude
oil
ended
this
week
with
the
rally
running
out
of
steam
the
question
is
what
happens
next
oil
prices
posted
steep
losses
just
as
the
bulls
were
back
on
the
march
wti
briefly
topped
per
barrel
in
recent
days
and
brent
was
flirting
with
but
the
rally
was
kneecapped
by
a
variety
of
factors
and
it
could
be
challenging
to
break
above
those
key
pricing
thresholds
in
the
near
a
lthough
the
timing
of
the
price
slide
comes
as
a
surprise
brent
dipped
well
below
for
a
time
on
thursday
the
slide
itself
does
not
as
expectations
recently
have
doubtless
been
too
optimistic
commerzbank
wrote
in
a
note
in
fact
to
some
the
timing
was
not
all
that
surprising
wti
faced
technical
resistance
at
around
and
having
failed
to
break
above
that
threshold
was
forced
back
beyond
the
technical
analysis
oil
prices
also
face
some
questions
on
the
fundamentals
the
emerging
market
turmoil
some
say
crisis
or
contagion
has
not
gone
away
currency
problems
continue
to
dog
a
long
list
of
emerging
market
economies
pushing
a
few
into
or
to
the
brink
of
fact
the
msci
emerging
market
index
of
equities
officially
fell
into
bear
market
territory
on
thursday
and
there
is
little
sign
of
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
my
fear
of
contagion
is
that
right
now
the
sentiment
towards
the
whole
spectrum
is
very
fragile
mario
castro
a
latin
america
currency
strategist
at
nomura
said
in
a
wall
street
journal
can
we
expect
an
oil
price
spike
in
november
because
much
of
global
oil
demand
growth
is
concentrated
in
economies
currency
weakness
could
have
an
outsized
impact
on
crude
oil
the
worries
about
demand
and
a
possible
spillover
from
emerging
markets
are
weighing
on
prices
hans
van
cleef
senior
energy
economist
at
abn
amro
bank
nv
told
bloomberg
we
have
tested
breaking
higher
but
that
failed
so
now
we
have
a
temporary
setback
i
still
expect
the
market
to
turn
higher
at
some
point
probably
driven
by
meanwhile
the
trump
administration
is
rumored
to
be
on
the
verge
of
dramatically
ramping
up
the
trade
war
with
china
potentially
moving
forward
on
some
billion
in
tariffs
that
would
surely
spark
a
response
from
china
and
the
retaliatory
trade
attacks
could
sap
global
growth
also
china
specifically
is
a
major
consumer
of
oil
and
one
of
the
largest
sources
of
demand
growth
so
a
slowdown
there
could
also
go
a
long
way
to
undercutting
oil
demand
this
past
week
the
eia
reported
weekly
data
that
showed
an
uptick
in
gasoline
inventories
a
bearish
sign
that
signals
both
an
end
to
summer
driving
season
and
possibly
hints
at
a
slowdown
in
demand
more
generally
it
s
one
data
point
however
so
it
doesn
t
indicate
a
solid
fact
even
as
the
markets
sold
off
crude
oil
on
the
news
fearing
a
deterioration
in
the
fundamentals
the
reaction
may
have
been
overblown
gasoline
demand
growth
has
not
been
impressive
in
but
total
us
oil
demand
growth
has
been
stronger
standard

said
in
a
note
as
for
the
rest
of
the
weekly
data
it
was
negative
but
also
unremarkable

this
yearthe
softness
in

days
has
taken
the
wind
out
of
the
sails
of
crude
oil
but
it
does
not
mean
we
are
on
the
verge
of
another
downturn
the
news
backdrop
does
not
really
point
to
any
further
price
slide
according
to
the

us
crude
oil
stocks
declined
by
a
surprisingly
sharp
million
barrels
to

last

their
lowest
level
since
february
things
also
remain
interesting
with
respect
to
the
iran
sanctions
particularly
as
far
as
the
situation
in
india
is
concerned
commerzbank
said
we
assume
that
new
delhi
will
bow
to
the
pressure
from
washington
so
the
supply
situation
on
the
oil
market
will
remain
with
two
months

go

data
from
the
eia
is
still
running
into
a
rough
patch
just
a
few
days
ago
the

that
