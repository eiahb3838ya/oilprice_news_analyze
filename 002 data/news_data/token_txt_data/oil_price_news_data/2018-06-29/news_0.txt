states
signaled
this
week
that
it
would
look
to
take
as
much
iranian
oil
as
possible
out
of
the

with
the
renewed
sanctions
on

and
allies
pledge
last
week
to
ease

in

boost

production
increases
will
make
the
global

thinner

a
time
of
low

the
stage
for

in

we
are
in
a
very
attractive
oil
price
environment
and
our
house
view
is
that
oil
will
hit

the
end
of

told
we
are
moving
into
an
environment
where
supply
disruptions
are
visible
all
over
the
and
of
course
president
trump
has
been
pretty
active
in
trying
to
isolate
iran
and
getting
allies
not
to
purchase
oil
from
iran
yazhari
with
inventories
still
declining
and
spare
capacity
uncomfortably
low
there
is
very
little
cushion
for
any
supply
disruption
caused
by
rising
geopolitical
risks
anz
bank
told
before
opec
s
meeting
last
week
the
international
energy
agency
iea
many
there
would
be
some
sort
of
production
increase
but
even
if
the
iran
and
venezuela
supply
gap
is
to
be
plugged
the
market
will
be
finely
balanced
next
year
and
vulnerable
to
prices
rising
higher
in
the
event
of
further
disruption
the
agency
said
in
its
oil
market
report
in
eia
defines
spare
capacity
as
the
volume
of
production
that
can
be
brought
on
within
days
and
sustained
for
at
least
days

this

in
the
world
is
in
just
four

kuwait
and

according
to
haigh
while
saudi

claims
that
it
has

socgen
thinks
that
it
s
more
like

million
bpd
kuwait
and

probably
have
another

haigh
iranian
oil
supply
may
have
been
the
leading
theme
in
oil
markets
this
week
but
venezuela
s
production
continues
to
crumble
with
socgen
estimating
that
it
would
drop
by
another
bpd
between
now
and
opec

next
regular
meeting
in
early
december
renewed
tension
in
libya
is
threatening
to
turn
into
yet
another
meaningful
oil
supply
disruption
amid
low
inventories
and
sparse
spare
capacity
as
saudis
and
russians
boost
production
another
supply
shock
would
not
be
well
received
analysts
decline
of
spare
capacity
leaves
pricing
risk
more
exposed
to
the
upside
brian
singer
managing
director
at
goldman
sachs
told
bloomberg
this
earlier
this
week
trump
administration
officials
confirmed
that
they
basically
want
to
take
all
iranian
exports
off
the
market
this
raises
the
prospect
of
an
even
higher
loss
than
with
saudi
pledging
a
million
there
will
be
little
spare
capacity
to
deal
with
any
additional
outages
according
to
helima

director
and

head
of

number
told
cnbc
this
week
that
the
sanctions
on
iran
are
incredibly
coercive
and
that
more
than
million
bpd
of
iranian
oil
would
be
taken
out
of
the
for
any
corporate
that
wants
to
do
business
in
the
united
states
they
will
drop
their
ties
with
iran
she
and
russians
may
be
boosting
production
but
the
risk
is
that
we
can
not
afford
another
supply
disruption
if
we
have
such
thin
spare
capacity
shock
absorbers
croft
key
question
for
the
oil
market
going
forward
will
not
be
how
much
russia
and
the
the
close
saudi
allies
such
as
the
uae
and
pump
to
plug
supply
losses
but
how
much
spare

this
would

to
