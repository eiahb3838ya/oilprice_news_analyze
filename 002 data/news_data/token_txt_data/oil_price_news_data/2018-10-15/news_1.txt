are u.s. oil exports really unstoppable?
earlier
this
year
when
crude
oil
exports
hit
a
record
million
bpd
the
figure
was
hailed
as
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
that
could
eventually
see
the
world
s
top
top
producer
for
this
year
so
export
up
to
million
bpd
some
believe
that
nothing
short
of
a
sharp
price
spike
can
interfere
with
the
bright
future
of
light
crude
indeed
if
fundamentals
were
the
only
factor
at
play
that
would
be
the
case
alas
there
are
more
factors
that
can
affect
the
future
of
the
united
states
as
a
major
oil
it
s
worth
noting
why
exports
are
growing
it
s
not
just
because
of
the
shale
boom
it
s
also
not
only
because
of
the
lifting
of
the
oil
export
ban
from
the
an
important
reason
for
the
jump
in
crude
oil
exports
is
the
fact
that
as
houston
chronicle
s
rye
druzin
noted
in
a
recent
story
a
lot
of
refineries
are
simply
not
equipped
for
processing
the
light
crude
they
need
heavier
grades
hence
the
still
existing
demand
for
canadian
and
venezuelan
oil
which
is
heavier
than
the
light
crude
pumped
from
the
could
invest
in
new
facilities
that
can
process
light
crude
but
it
is
a
large
undertaking
still
chevron
is
doing
it
although
as
druzin
points
out
it
might
be
the
exception
for
most
exporting
the
crude
they
can
t
absorb
in
the
refineries
is
the
preferred
option
so
this
means
exports
are
set
for
a
rise
whatever
happens
right
wrong
of
course
there
is
no
such
thing
as
whatever
the
clearest
sign
yet
that
oil
is
not
yet
ready
to
take
over
is
china
s
zero
oil
imports
in
august
local
refiners
apparently
decided
to
be
cautious
amid
the
deepening
trade
row
between
washington
and
beijing
and
perhaps
see
if
they
can
make
do
without
crude
they
did
make
do
total
chinese
oil
imports
in
august
went
up
by
percent
hitting
a
reason
china
is
important
is
that
as
of
july
it
was
the
buyer
of
crude
after
canada
it
took
in
percent
of
total
oil
exports
last
year
and
percent
this
year
until
august
that
s
more
than
a
fifth
of
total
exports
and
truth
be
told
the
receiving
country
mix
is
not
that
great
without
china
related
oil
s
billion
black
marketsure
producers
are
exporting
to
japan
and
india
as
well
and
india
is
a
top
importer
of
crude
but
india
is
also
having
trouble
with
its
oil
bill
already
and
oil
will
be
hard
pressed
to
compete
with
middle
eastern
crude
which
is
simply
a
lot
closer
to
india
and
hence
korea
is
also
a
buyer
of
oil
and
it
has
a
stronger
economy
than
india
and
could
therefore
afford
costlier
crude
for
a
while
especially
after
it
cut
its
imports
of
iranian
oil
to
zero
in
anticipation
of
a
pat
on
the
head
for
complying
with
washington
s
request
for
iranian
import
cuts
to
zero
japan
is
a
staunch
ally
and
a
major
oil
importer
so
that
s
good
for
exporters
european
countries
notably
the
netherlands
the
uk
and
italy
and
to
a
lesser
extent
france
and
denmark
are
also
buyers
of
crude
but
the
amounts
they
need
are
too
low
to
spur
a
true
export
boom
in
fact
morgan
stanley
warned
about
this
earlier
this
year
before
the
trade
spat
grew
into
a
heated
conflict
the
prospects
of
oil
demand
growth
in
europe
are
modest
at
on
top
of
it
all
the
new
emission
rules
of
the
international
maritime
organization
will
spur
demand
for
heavier
crude
and
shale
producers
may
be
forced
to
discount
their
crude
to
enhance
its
competitiveness
or
maybe
some
of
them
will
start
investing
in
local
light
crude
refining
capacity
after
all
the
