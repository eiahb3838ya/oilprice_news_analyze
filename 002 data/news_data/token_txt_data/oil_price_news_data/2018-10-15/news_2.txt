south
korea
has
stopped
importing
crude
oil
from
iran
ahead
of
the
sanctions
that
will

the
country
imported
zero
iranian
oil
in
september
for
the
first
time
in
six
news
is
the
expected
end
of
a
process
since
the
start
of
south
korean
imports
of
iranian
crude
had
fallen
by
percent
from
as
of
the
end
of
september
to
a
total
million
tons
the
country
s
total
september
imports
also
declined
on
an
annual
basis
by
more
than
a
tenth
to
million
share
of
crude
went
up
fivefold
to
tons
in
the
reported
month
while
imports
of
saudi
crude
declined
by

to
million
korea
is
the
world
s
crude
oil
importer
and
as
such
an
important
client
for
iran
s
oil
alongside
china
and
india
yet
south
korea
is
a
close
ally
of
the
united
states
and
it
is
no
surprise
the
country
opted
for
full
compliance
with
washington
s
insistence
on
importers
to
cut
their
intake
of
iranian
crude
to
the
country
s
government
hopes
it
will
be
rewarded
with
a
sanction
waiver
so
it
can
restart
purchases
of
iranian
oil
although
it
would
be
at
a
much
lower
rate
in
all
likelihood
since
the
start
of
the
iranian
year
in
late
march
south
korea
had
been
buying
iranian
crude
at
a
daily
rate
of
almost
this
year
reports
emerged
that
south
korea
was
planning
to
stop
buying
iranian
oil
in
july
but
official
korean
sources
refuted
the
claims
made
by
unnamed
sources
in
september
bloomberg
reported
that
south
korea
had
stopped
importing
iranian
earlier
in
august
citing
shipping
data
yet
with
iranian
tankers
cloaking
their
journeys
to
crude
oil
buyers
official
tracking
data
may
not
be
as
