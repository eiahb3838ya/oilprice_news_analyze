is this the most contentious opec meeting yet?
both
saudi
arabia
and
russia
recently
increased
their
oil
production
levels
an
indication
that
they
are
getting
a
head
start
on
higher
output
even
as
possible
changes
to
the
agreement
remain
up
in
the
is
growing
discord
from
within
opec
with
iraq
joining
a
group
of
those
opposed
to
higher
output
levels
iraq
s
oil
minister
said
that
the
objective
of
the
cuts
has
not
yet
been
achieved
and
that
iraq
rejects
unilateral
decisions
made
by
some
producers
which
do
not
consult
with
the
those
comments
come
after
venezuela
and
iran
formerly
requested
solidarity
against
sanctions
and
lobbed
angry
statements
at
saudi
arabia
for
seeming
to
comply
with
requests
for
higher
oil
solidifying
opposition
among
a
solid
portion
of
opec
against
higher
output
comes
even
as
saudi
arabia
ratcheted
up
production
by
somewhere
between
and
bpd
in
may
likely
taking
output
back
above
million
barrels
per
day
russia
also
boosted
production
by
more
than
bpd
in
early
june
because
the
top
two
oil
producers
are
already
starting
to
increase
output
and
they
are
pretty
much
the
only
ones
in
favor
of
increasing
production
the
opec
meeting
is
shaping
up
to
be
highly
oil
market
is
assuming
some
level
of
increase
at
the
upcoming
meeting
which
is
why
prices
have
fallen
back
from
recent
highs
and
have
remain
subdued
but
higher
opec
production
does
not
necessarily
mean
a
market
nor
does
it
mean
that
price
stability
will
stick
is
one
major
factor
that
the
market
seems
to
be
overlooking
any
increase
in
production
will
come
at
the
expense
of
the
already
limited
spare
capacity
saudi
arabia
holds
the
bulk
of
global
spare
capacity
which
can
be
defined
as
a
volume
of
oil
that
can
be
called
upon
at
short
notice
and
then
sustained
for
a
period
of
time
deploying
that
surplus
while
adding
supplies
to
the
market
will
cut
into
the
to
reuters
and
data
from
bank
jeffries
if
saudi
arabia
and
russia
hike
production
global
spare
capacity
would
shrink
from
the
current
percent
of
global
demand
down
to
just
percent
that
margin
would
be
the
lowest
in
more
than
three
decades
you
would
essentially
be
taking
million
barrels
per
day
bpd
of
spare
capacity
down
to
approximately
million
bpd

according

markets
unmoved
by

summitsome
other
analysts
say
the
cushion
could
be
even
smaller
the
eia
said
that
opec
s
spare
capacity
was
only
at
in
the
first
quarter
of
a
figure
that
is
assumed
to
decline
over
the
next
year
and
a
half
if
saudi
arabia
ramps
up
output
to
say
as
it
was
before
the
onset
of
the
agreement
at
the
start

that
would

the
saudis
are
well
aware
of
the
problem
saudi
oil
minister
khalid
said
as
much
last
month
in
an
interview
with
reuters
we
are
concerned
about
tight
spare
capacity
nowadays
he
until
recently
the
massive
volume
of
oil
sitting
in
inventories
has
acted
as
a
form
of
spare
capacity
that
surplus
has
been
well
above
average
levels
since
and
it
has
taken
an
extended
period
of
time
to
use
up
that
excess
but
we
have
arrived
at
that
point
the
production
cuts
have
eliminated
the
inventory
surplus
and
inventories
could
draw
down
for
the
rest
of
this
year
if
the
coalition
doesn
t
increase
is
why
saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
on
the
verge
of
adding
supply
back
into
the
market
but
with
the
inventory
surplus
gone
spare
capacity
now
moves
front
and
center
higher
production
will
directly
cut
into
some
of
the
few
sources
of
supply
that
can
be
called
upon
at
a
moment
s
notice
related
permian
boom
jeopardized
by
pipeline
troubles
so
were
they
to
raise
by
million
bpd
then
million
bpd
is
left
scraping
the
low
end
of
the
range
historically
and
uncomfortably
tight
given
the
high
and
rising
geopolitical
disruption
risk
robert
mcnally
of
the
rapidan
energy
group
told
the
past
whenever
spare
capacity
ran
low
it
coincided
with
periods
in
which
oil
prices
were
high
and
extremely
volatile
such
as
in
when
prices
broke
unexpected
outage
would
have
an
outsized
impact
on
the
market
because
producers
would
have
even
more
trouble
replacing
missing
barrels
that
means
that
a
pipeline
explosion
in
nigeria
or
libya
for
instance
could
send
prices
skyward
unexpectedly
sharp
declines
in
venezuela
worse
than
the
market
is
already
taking
into
account
would
have
a
similar
effect
disruptions
to
iranian
supply
are
also
arabia
claims
it
can
produce
or
perhaps
even
more
but
analysts
question
those
figures
because
saudi
aramco
s
operations
are
a
closely
held
state
secret
nobody
really
knows
if
riyadh
decides
to
boost
output
and
run
down
spare
capacity
their
capabilities
might
be
put
to
the
test
over
the
next
year
if
there
is
a
major
unexpected
outage
the
oil
market
would
be
in
