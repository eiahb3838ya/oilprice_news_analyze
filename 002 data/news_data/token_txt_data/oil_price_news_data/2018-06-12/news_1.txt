saudis lift oil production to 10 million bpd
saudi
arabia
pumped
over
bpd
of
crude
oil
more
in
may
with
daily
production
reaching
million
bpd
officials
from
the
country
s
oil
industry
said
as
quoted
by
the
oil
and
gas
journal
adding
that
plans
are
to
add
a
further
bpd
this
news
comes
on
the
heels
of
russian
media
reports
that
the
country
s
oil
production
recovered
to
million
barrels
this
is
bpd
above
the
country
s
quota
under
the
production
cut
deal
and
only
about
bpd
below
the
production
rate
in
november
which
russia
took
as
basis
for
its
other
words
while
some
analysts
still
wonder
if
the
reports
about
russia
and
saudi
arabia
discussing
a
production
increase
of
million
bpd
are
just
speculation
or
an
action
plan
the
increase
is
already
happening
and
it
is
making
at
least
one
other
opec
member
iraq
s
oil
minister
jabbar
said
baghdad
rejects
unilateral
decisions
by
some
oil
producers
without
consulting
the
rest
of
the
members
of
opec
clearly
signaling
that
saudi
arabia
leader
of
the
opec
pack
as
it
may
be
is
not
free
to
raise
production
without
telling
anyone
about
it
related
can
saudi
arabia
prevent
the
next
oil
shock
there
are
already
a
lot
of
signs
pointing
towards
a
tough
june
meeting
with
russia
and
saudi
arabia
clearly
in
favor
of
higher
production
and
iraq
and
iran
clearly
opposed
to
it
iraq
is
not
really
in
a
good
position
to
oppose
the
raise
however
opec
s
never
complied
with
its
cut
quota
of
bpd
in
fact
estimates
by
platts
show
iraq
has
exceeded
its
ceiling
by
the
most
within
some
bpd
since
the
start
of
the
deal
with
compliance
at
just
upcoming
meeting
is
shaping
up
as
a
tough
one
as
some
analysts
have
already
warned
when
opec
agreed
to
cuts
some
members
notably
iraq
took
quite
a
lot
of
convincing
that
it
was
necessary
to
start
cutting
and
it
looks
like
now
they
will
need
equally
intensive
convincing
that
it
s
time
