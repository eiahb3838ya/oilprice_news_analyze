will rising crude inventories end the rally?
crude
oil
inventories
jumped
this
past
week
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
three
months
rising
by
million
barrels
the
inventory
increase
coming
at
a
time
of
surging
oil
production
could
rattle
the
oil
price
rally
however
the
stock
builds
were
always
expected
and
are
typical
at
this
time
of
jump
in
inventories
put
an
end
to
consecutive
weeks
of
inventory
drawdowns
which
have
the
stock
surplus
within
sight
of
the
average
that
could
test
the
oil
price
rally
which
has
sputtered
in
the
last
few
weeks
with
brent
at
about
per
barrel

but
refineries
tend
to
head
into
maintenance
in
february
and
march
retooling
ahead
of
warmer
months
when
demand
usually
rises
and
as
most
major
analysts
have
predicted
including
the
iea
eia
and
opec
the
stock
build
was
inventory
increase
came
not
coincidentally
in
a
week
in
which
refinery
inputs
dropped
significantly
falling
from
million
barrels
per
day
for
the
week
ending
on
january
to
for
the
week
ending
on
january
averages
as
refineries
throttle
back
the
pull
on
crude
oil
from
inventories
at
least
according
to
the
most
recent
data
the
trend
isn
t
overwhelmingly
bearish
standard
chartered
noted
that
the
increase
in
inventories
was
not
even
that
large
on
a
seasonal
basis
and
it
was
less
than
the
average
although
the
past
five
years
have
included
several
years
of
extraordinary
stock
increases
so
the
average
is
somewhat
misleading
while
stocks
increased
on
an
absolute
basis
they
didn
t
really
increase
against
that
a
bit
more
comfort
to
oil
bulls
was
the
draw
in
gasoline
and
another
sharp
draw
at
cushing
that
took
inventories
below
their
range
standard
chartered
wrote
in
a
note
lower
refining
runs
might
mean
a
diminishing
effect
on
crude
demand
but
it
also
means
that
refineries
won
t
be
stashing
so
much
gasoline
into
storage
the
eia
said
that
gasoline
stocks
fell
in
the
most
recent
week
by
million
barrels
related
oil
markets
are
at
a
stalematein
other
words
the
stock
build
is
not
the
bearish
news
that
it
might
seem
particular
because
it
was
widely
expected
to
crop
up
at
some
point
in
the
first
the
is
only
part
of
the
picture
stocks
have
been
declining
around
the
world
not
least
because
production
outside
of
north
america
is
flat
and
in
some
countries
falling
by
quite
a
ultimately
we
think
the
market
is
a
little
bit
of
a
smokescreen
actually
for
the
oil
industry
with
ongoing
supply
issues
elsewhere
and
also
the
strong
demand
really
tightening
up
this
market
and
further
i
suppose
reducing
that
global
inventory
glut
that
opec
has
been
targeting
for
some
time
daniel
hynes
of
anz
told
goldman
sachs
stated
that
it
believes
the
rebalancing
effort
is
already
here
instead
of
just
looking
at
inventories
opec
is
targeting
inventories
across
the
oecd
oil
production
is
surging
which
will
push
up
inventories
for
a
good
part
of
this
year
but
that
isn
t
the
case
elsewhere
even
that
data
omits
what
is
going
on
in
the
where
demand
is
growing
at
a
much
faster
sachs
says
the
timespreads
in
the
futures
market
implies
that
inventories
are
currently
much
lower
than
many
people
think
oecd
stock
data
is
published
with
a
longer
lag
time
and
while
it
will
take
time
to
see
a
clearer
picture
the
investment
bank
estimates
that
the
point
of
rebalancing
has
arrived
opec
will
keep
the
cuts
in
place
and
the
market
will
probably
tighten
well
below
the
average
before
that
is
reflected
in
the
data
this
is
why
the
bank
sees
brent
going
above
per
barrel
in
the
next
six
the
oil
market
will
have
a
murky
picture
for
a
little
while
longer
the
market
is
tightening
and
many
expect
it
to
tighten
particularly
in
the
second
half
of
this
year
but
the
expected
increase
in
crude
inventories
over
the
next
few
weeks
and
months
will
muddy
the
waters
oil
traders
will
see
soaring
oil
production
and
inventory
builds
as
a
sign
that
the
market
tightening
has
slowed
and
indeed
with
the
preponderance
of
speculative
positions
on
the
bullish
side
there
is
downside
last
week
s
inventory
increase
and
the
stock
builds
to
come
don
t
necessarily
