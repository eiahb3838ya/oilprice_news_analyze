can we expect a rise in gulf of mexico oil production?
eia

provides
estimates
of
proved
reserves
based
on
information
from
the
e

for

and
also
shows
the
categories
for

data

been
due
since

but
so
far
has
been
twice
delayed

make
their
own
estimates
for

and
probable
based
on
strict
adherence
to
rules
the
reserve
must
be
on
production
or
be
expected
to
be
produced
within
five
years
i
think
this
usually
comes
out
in
may
in
the
absence
of
the
latest
eia
numbers
i
ve
presented
the
numbers
with
adjustments
for
subsequent
production
there
will
be
revisions
and
additional
discoveries
to
include
once
the
actual
data
is
available
though
i
think
fairly
small
especially
for
gas
but
it
will
be
interesting
to

despite
excluding
probable
reserves
and
counting
crude
only
the
eia
estimates
have
recently
exceeded
those
from
boem
it
looks
like
a
lot
of
the
probable
reserves
were
converted
to
proved
through
positive
revisions
in
the
period
to
possibly
due
to
some
price
increases
then
but
also
immediately
following
the
sec
rule
changes
to
exclude
reserves
without
firm
development
plans
which
may
or
may
not
be
coincidental
the
e
ps
may
be
less
strict
on
applying
the
rule
which
they
are
allowed
to
do
for
large
long
term
projects
the
boem
estimates
are
pretty
much
flat
over
recent
years
as
additions
which
then
become
backdated
discoveries
from
new
projects
going
through
fid
balance
production
whereas
eia
estimates
are
declining
with

zero

negative

sales
and
acquisitions
mostly
balance
out
sometimes
with
a
year
or
so
lag
though
overall
slightly
positive
which
i
guess
means
the
purchasers
are
able
to
get
a
bit
more
from
the
fields
than
the
sellers
there
are
few
extensions
to
conventional
fields
unlike
lto
where
they
are
the
largest
positive
factor
and
discoveries
have
trended
down
significantly
over
the
last
three
or
four
years
this
would
probably
have
happened
a
couple
of
years
earlier
but
for
the

note
that
several

did
not
report

i

the

i
don
t
know
how
much
more
there
is
to
come
but
certainly
tahiti

atlantis
have
large
brownfield
developments
in
progress
the
larger
ones
shown
are
around
ten
years
old
which
would
normally
be
seeing
the
end
of
a
plateau
period
but
equally
they
tend
to
have
a
lot
of
excess
processing
capacity
if
nothing
else
some
of
them
must
be
due
for
major
in
the
next
couple
of
years
which
would
take
about
as
much
production

a

the

not

have
started

against

for
compensation
due
to
safety
failings
all
these
fields
were
in
fairly
steep
decline
so
the
production
and
therefore
revenue
and
interest
is
only
lost
while
they
are
offline
rather
than
being
deferred

would
be

been
announced
as
variously
major

does
sound
pretty
big

is
near

and
ballymore

is
near

i
suspect
both
will
be
as
the
reason
for
concentrating
on

exploration
was
to
save
money
on
subsequent
developments
perdido
has
kbpd
nameplate
and
currently
produces
kbpd
and
blind
faith
has
kbpd
with
over
kbpd
capacity
available
and
rising
appraisal
drilling
is
continuing
on
both
and
that
hasn
t
always
been
as
great
as
the
initial
announcements
kaskida
shenendoah
and
recently
phobos
i
m
not
certain
but
think
they
both
may
count
against
last
year
s
discoveries
and
the
announcements
have
been
delayed
to
be
immediately
before
the
financial
mackenzie
was
reported
as
giving
predicted
gom
production
of
kboepd
a
new
record
i
think
this
is
an
average
rather
than
a
peak
or
exit
rate
but
i
couldn
t
find
for
sure
note
this
is
oil
and
gas
reported
as
including
percent
c
c
i
think
but
could
be
total
liquids
and
doesn
t
include
shallow
water
which
may
be
below
common
industry
limit
or
boem
limit
the
report
didn
t
say
i
don
t
know
why
it
was
made
so
complicated
probably
so
they
can
declare
a
record
of
some
kind
which
would
help
or
try
and
sell
the
full

february

are
well
related

the
number
of

activities
for

is

the

but
probably
still
early

scenariosbelow
is
an
updated
projected
scenario
guess
for
future
production
the
total
production
in
each
section
equals
the
estimated
reserves
for
those
fields
from
boem
numbers
for
january
less
any
production
since
then
their
estimates
for
this
year
showing
january
numbers
have
not
yet
been
issued
for
projects
under
development
and
discoveries
i
ve
used
the
e
p
numbers
for
reserves
production
and
where
available
or
just
made
a
guess
numbers
in
brackets
are
nominal
crude
and
condensate
nameplate
capacity
for
the
expected
development
i
ve
included
some
nominal
new
discoveries
with
total
reserves
of
mmbbls
but
may
have
to
change
that
once
the
whale
numbers
are
ve
also
shown
the
boem
production
forecast
which
i
don
t
fully
understand
for
instance
they
have
production
suddenly
dropping
about
kbpd
this
year
but
being
made
up
with
contingent
numbers
which
i
would
have
assumed
is
possible
development
but
can
t
be
but
also
can
t
be
planned
because
there
is
nothing
like
that
amount
due
this
year
they
also
have
a
large
amount
of
new
discoveries
that
come
on
line
very
quickly
ten
years
to
bring
on
line

would
be
