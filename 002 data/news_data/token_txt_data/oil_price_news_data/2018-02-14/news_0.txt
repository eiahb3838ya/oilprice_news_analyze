physical oil markets don’t lie – is another crash likely?
oil
prices
are
falling
and
analysts
and
market
players
are
as
eager
as
ever
to
explain
the
decline
in
accordance
with
their
own
bullish
or
bearish
leanings
it
s
a
natural
correction
that
was
only
to
be
expected
after
the
buildup
of
long
bets
on
crude
oil
and
oil
product
futures
the
bulls
insist
it
s
the
start
of
a
trend
thanks

the

these
are
physical
markets
the
markets
where
actual
oil
is
taken
from
one
place
and
shipped
to
another
to
be
refined
into
fuel
and
other
products
as
opposed
to
the
speculative

market
if
the

a

opec

general
mohammed

earlier
this
enough
barkindo
also
said
he
had
russian
president
vladimir
putin
s
word
that
russia
will
not
flood
the
market
with
oil
while
the
cut
deal
still
holds
the
reason
this
statement
is
interesting
is
that
it
is
the
latest
example
of
opec
s
tendency
towards
upbeat
comments
that
have
little
substance

another

the
