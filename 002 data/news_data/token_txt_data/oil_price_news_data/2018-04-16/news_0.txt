can the worldâ€™s most profitable company justify its valuation?
one
of
the
best
kept
secrets
in
oil
over
the
past
decades
has
been
how
much
money
saudi
oil
giant
aramco
has
been
making
from
extracting
what
s
probably
the
oil
in
the
has
never
reported
such
figures
and
as
an
entirely
enterprise
it
was
not
obliged
to
do
so
but
now
that
it
aims
to
list
percent
of
its
likely
in
than
in
as
initially
will
have
to
report
numbers
at
the
very
least
in
its
ipo
speculation
as
to
when
and
where
saudi
aramco
will
list
ranges
from
the
saudi
stock
market
only
in
to
we
re
ready
for
an
ipo
we
re
just
waiting
for
the
right
time
bloomberg
news
has
the
generated
us
billion
in
net
income
for
the
first
half
of
absolute
shows
that
aramco
is
not
only
the
world
s
most
profitable
oil
company
it
means
that
saudi
aramco
is
more
profitable
that
the
most
profitable
listed
company
in
the
world
apple
aramco
s
us
net
profit
is
also
higher
than
the
combined
net
incomes
for
of
all
of
big
oil
s
shell
chevron
total
and
stunning
net
income
in
the
saudi
oil
giant
s
figures
may
be
impressive
but
the
other
numbers
that
bloomberg
has
reviewed
in
aramco
s
accounts
are
not
so
obvious
question
from
this
scoop
is
do
those
numbers
justify
a
us
valuation
of
figure
that
saudi
officials
have
been
targeting
since
they
announced
that
they
wanted
to
list
the
oil
giant
to
reap
billions
in
proceeds
to
pay
for
economic
diversification
from
the
kingdom
s
oil
saudi
officials
worried
about
oil
s
futurethe
short
answer
is
no
according
to
various
analysts
and
institutional
investors
who
have
been
asked
to
crunch
the
aramco
to
bloomberg
calculations
aramco
s
production
costs
imply
a
rough
estimate
that
it
extracts
oil
at
a
cost
of
less
and
us
a
barrel
compared
to
shell
and
exxon
s
cost
of
us
for
terms
of
cash
flows
however
aramco
s
figures
are
not
so
impressive
its
cash
from
operations
was
us
billion
in
compared
to
shell
s
us
billion
and
exxon
s
us
billion
yet
shell
for
example
pumped
just
a
quarter
of
the
oil
volumes
that
aramco
extracted
in
to
its
oil
production
aramco
generates
lower
cash
from
operations
than
shell
and
exxon
do
the
reason
aramco
pays
a
income
tax
plus
a
royalty
to
the
state
of
saudi
arabia
that
varies
according
to
the
price
of
higher
the
oil
prices
the
more
marginal
royalty
rate
aramco
pays
to
the
kingdom
this
means
that
even
with
higher
oil
prices
future
investors
in
aramco
will
see
limited
gains
because
the
royalties
that
the
company
would
have
to
pay
to
saudi
arabia
would
rise
as
the
price
of
oil
to
the
financial
information
that
bloomberg
news
has
seen
saudi
arabia
has
linked
the
royalty
regime
for
aramco
to
oil
prices
replacing
a
fixed
royalty
without
publicly
announcing
the
change
as
of
january
saudi
arabia
imposes
a
marginal
rate
of
percent
of
revenue
for
oil
prices
up
to
a
barrel
percent
for
the
price
of
oil
between
and
and
percent
for
oil
prices
above
since
january
last
year
aramco
s
royalties
have
been
calculated
based
on
a
progressive
scheme
say
the
financials
that
bloomberg
has
seen
another
change
in
the
royalty
payment
scheme
is
that
aramco
is
now
paying
royalties
on
crude
oil
and
condensate
production
on
the
value
of
crude
oil
and
refined
products
sold
as
exports
as
it
was
previously
worded
the
difference
is
around
million
of
all
to
can
aramco
achieve
the
us
valuation
related
the
trump
twitter
effect
on
oil
priceseven
at
this
astonishing
net
income
according
to
analysts
who
say
that
while
the
cost
of
production
is
an
important
metric
for
the
valuation
the
price
of
oil
is
the
most
important
investors
crunched
the
numbers
for
bloomberg
and
are
saying
that
aramco
could
get
a
valuation
of
between
us
trillion
and
us
half
of
what
the
saudis
are
hoping
for
this
valuation
is
based
on
oil
prices
at
us
in
the
long
term
and
valuation
models
that
are
similar
to
those
applied
to
other
major
financial
times
ran
the
numbers
in
a
model
and
asked
experts
about
aramco
s
valuation
most
answers
were
close
to
us
trillion
the
ft
calculated
the
reported
financials
and
found
that
at
oil
prices
of
around
us
aramco
gets
a
valuation
of
us
trillion
with
oil
prices
at
us
the
saudi
giant
would
achieve
a
valuation
of
us
trillion
a
us
valuation
can
only
be
achieved
if
oil
prices
were
to
rise
to
around

a
barrel

according
to
aswath
damodaran
a
finance
professor
at
new
york
university
aramco
is
a
source
of
saudi
wealth
and
the
kingdom
wants
to
have
its
cake
and
eat
it
too
it
wants
to
go
public
and
be
treated
as
a
normal
entity
but
they
also
need
to
use
it
as
a
cash
there
is
no
way
it
gets
to
it

a
fantasy
