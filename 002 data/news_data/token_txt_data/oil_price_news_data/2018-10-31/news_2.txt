oil
markets
continue
to
be
jittery
yet
prices
seem
to
be
rather
oblivious
to
inventory
reports
from
the
united
states
the

s
latest
report
is
unlikely
to
change
that
the

reported
a
build
of
million
barrels

the
week
to
october
a
day
after
the

estimated
inventories
had
risen
by
a

million
barrels

the

reported
an

of
over

down

in

gasoline

were
down

the
the
positive
effect
on

of

it

that
in
the

concern
over
the
