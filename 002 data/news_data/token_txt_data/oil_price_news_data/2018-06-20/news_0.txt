opec meeting could end without decision
back
in
when
opec
met
to
discuss
raising
oil
production
to
offset
the
drop
in
libya
resulting
from
the
civil
war
saudi
arabia
s
ali
called
it
one
of
the
worst
meetings
that
meeting
ended
without
consensus
and
this
is
likely
to
happen
again
this
week
when
the
cartel
meets
to
discuss
another
production
fault
line
is
between
saudi
arabia
and
russia
which
have
both
signaled
that
they
are
all
for
a
substantial
increase
in
production
of
up
to
million
bpd
and
iran
iraq
libya
and
algeria
to
date
which
would
have
a
problem
raising
their
latest
remarks
from
iran
s
oil
minister
are
not
really
encouraging
bijan
zanganeh
said
as
quoted
by
reuters
that
i
don
t
believe
at
this
meeting
we
can
reach
agreement
opec
is
not
the
organization
to
receive
instruction
from
president
trump
opec
is
not
part
of
the
department
of
energy
of
the
united
the
comment
refers
to
president
trump
s
tweets
about
opec
artificially
pushing
prices
higher
and
reports
that
he
personally
asked
saudi
arabia
s
government
to
step
in
and
replace
iranian
barrels
with
its
own
after
sanctions
kick
also
said
he
will
be
leaving
vienna
before
opec
s
meeting
with
russia
and
the
other
partners
in
the
cut
deal
russia
is
iran
s
geopolitical
ally
but
now
they
are
in
opposing
camps
with
regard
to
oil
production
moves
and
missing
that
particular
meeting
could
be
a
diplomatic
move
to
avoid

minister
alexander
novak
said
oil
demand
usually
grows
at
the
steepest
pace
in
the
third
quarter
we
could
face
a
deficit
if
we
don
t
take
measures
echoing
widely
shared
analyst
expectations
of
booming
oil
demand
that
they
have
argued
was
instrumental
in
the
oil
price
improvement
over
the
last
year
or
as
it
has
been
it
is
not
as
robust
and
unyielding
as
previously
believed
when
prices
climbed
closer
to
us
a
barrel
demand
growth
began
to
slow
down
which
for
some
reason
surprised
many
oil
bulls
related
goldman
expect
another
bull
run
in
oilthis
slowdown
in
demand
growth
highlighted
the
fact
that
the
emerging
economies
that
are
the
biggest
drivers
behind
global
oil
demand
growth
are
not
ready
to
pay
whatever
asking
price
they
are
offered
they
are
rather
going
to
bargain
for
lower
prices
which
is
exactly
what
india
and
china
did
prompting
opec
to
consider
an
early
end
to
the
for
the
internal
fractures
within
opec
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
two
of
saudi
arabia
s
gulf
and
also
not
on
board
with
a
quick
major
production
boost
they
seem
to
be
leaning
more
towards
a
gradual
and
more
modest
increase
reuters
reports
citing
opec
sources
indeed
some
believe
russia
s
proposal
is
a
tactical
move
aimed
at
priming
the
dissenters
for
agreement
to
a
more
modest

not

seems
to
be

a
bigger
