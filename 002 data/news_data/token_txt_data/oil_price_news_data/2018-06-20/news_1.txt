and
higher

be
enough
and
now
he
expects
opec

change
something
for
better

he
said
that
is
not
fair
opec
is
an
independent
organization
not
an
organization

instruction
from
president
trump
opec
is
not
part
of
the
department
of
energy
of
the
united
states
he
crude

have
surged
nearly
percent
to

any
mohammad
barkindo
said
on
june
he
was
confident
there
would
be
a
deal
during
the
june
oil
chief
jabar
said
he
hoped
there
would
be
agreement
when
opec
met
but
added
that
the
oil
market
has
not
reached
the
level
of
stabilization
iran
opposition
to
raising
oil
output
puts
it
on
a
collision
course
with
russia
which
has
called
for
raising
production
by
million
barrels
a

in
a
rollback
of
the
production
energy
minister
aleksandr
novak
said
the
need
for
increased
output
is
urgent
during
the
summer
when
demand
for
gasoline
and
oil
hits
a
high
point
for
the
year
related
goldman
expect
another
bull
run
in

oil
demand
usually
grows
at
the
steepest
pace
in
the
third
quarter
we
could
face
a
deficit
if
we
do
take
measures
novak
said
on
june
in
our
view
this
could
lead
to
market
overheating
meaning
sharply
higher
said
that
if
opec
and
its
allies
decide
this
week
to
raise
output
they
could
review
their
decision
and
it
at
another
planned
meeting
in
arabia
a
close
ally
of
the
united
states
is
particularly
under
pressure
from
trump
to
offset
any
production
decline
caused
by
the
reimposition
of
sanctions
on
iran
in
and
others
have
also
warned
that
continuing
to
limit
supply
could
encourage
