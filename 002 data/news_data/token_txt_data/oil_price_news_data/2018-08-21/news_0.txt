spending boost fails to raise production in the permian
the
shale
industry
is
gearing
up
to
spend
more
this
year
despite
assurances
to
maintain
capital
the
second
quarter
shale
companies
signaled
their
intention
to
lift
capex
part
of
the
reason
is
that
costs
are
on
the
rise
so
some
drillers
have
to
spend
more
to
produce
the
same
amount
of
oil
and
gas
that
was
an
unexpected
development
and
one
that
shareholders
are
not
happy
survey
of
shale
companies
by
rystad
energy
found
that
while
the
group
revised
up
spending
by
about
percent
they
only
increased
their
expected
production
levels
for
this
year
by
percent
this
disconnect
might
suggest
that
the
shale
industry
requires
more
capital
than
before
to
achieve
healthy
production
growth
rystad
said
in
a
new
are
some
signs
that
the
permian
for
instance
is
running
into
some
productivity
problems
raising
the
possibility
that
the
highly
touted
efficiency
gains
over
the
past
few
years
are
reaching
their
the
other
hand
the
industry
is
also
spending
more
because
they
have
plans
to
increase
drilling
activity
which
could
lead
to
higher
output
next
year
w
hile
a
part
of
increased
spending
is
due
to
service
cost
inflation
a
significant
part
of
the
incremental
budget
is
also
planned
to
be
used
for
additional
drilling
throughout
to
support
more
intensive
completion
activity
and
production

rystad

venezuela

unprecedented
action
to

currencythe
largest
spending
increase
came
from
companies
focused
on
the
permian
basin
which
is
not
surprising
given
both
the
frenzied
pace
of

well
as
the

that
the

occidental

out
from
the
bunch
with
an
announced
increase
in

occidental
said
it
was
going

as
well
as

rystad

supporting

in
the

another
notable
upward

with
a
plan
to
add
four
more

for
the
higher

is
also
the
result
of
a
plan
to
increase
completion
activity
plus

it
wasn

just
the
permian
that
is
attracting

longer

and

meanwhile
the
bakken

increased
spending
by

for
higher
completion
levels
and
additional
so
much
additional
spending
pouring
into
the
shale
patch
one
would
think
that
the
industry
would
revise
up
its
expected
volumes
of
oil
and
gas
but
collectively
the
group
is
only
expecting
to
produce
an

their
success
is
the
result
of
greater
than

of

underpinned
by

rystad

concluded
they
are
also
growing
from
a
relatively
small
upward
revisions
were
offset
by
the
disappointing
results
from
a
handful
of
other
companies
resolute

rounded
out
the
bottom
of
the

down

due
to
less
than

content
from
its

so
far
this
year
noble
energy
revised
its
forecasted
production
down
by
percent
as
it
decided
to
defer
completion
on
some
of
its
drilled
wells
the
result
of
industry
constraints
in
the
the
weakest
eia
report
in
yearsnotably
however
none
of
the
permian
operators
reported
a
planned
decrease
in
completion
activity
in
the
basin
this
year
rystad
cost
inflation
is
playing
a
pivotal
role
in
driving
up
spending
budgets
but
rystad
cautioned
not
to
take
that
conclusion
too
far
much
of
the
spending
increase
is
also
laying
the
groundwork
for
higher
production
down
the
road
while
higher
cost
inflation
played
a
role
in
the
uptick
in
investment
budgets
as
evident
from
earnings
reports
the
majority
of
incremental
capital
expenditure
is
still
planned
to
be
directed
to
a
larger
number
of
intensive
completions
and
facility
rystad
reason
that
the
revisions
to
the
guidance
for
look
so
unimpressive
is
that
these
investments
may
only
result
in
production
increases
next
year
that
approach
makes
sense
given
that
pipeline
constraints
in
the
permian
won
t
be
resolved
until
late
next
year
a
lot
of
companies
are
doing
the
upfront
work
on
drilling
but
deferring
completions
until
when
new
pipelines
come
online
and
midland
differentials
rise
in
other
words
shareholders
may
groan
at
some
of
the
figures
that
came
out
of
second
quarter
earnings
reports
but
most
shale
executives
expect
things
to
improve
