u.s. oil exports continue to break records
crude
oil
exports
broke
yet
another
record
spiking
to
million
barrels
per
day
for
the
week
ending
on
may
with
shale
surging
and
export
terminals
retooling
on
the
gulf
coast
the
export
surge
is
likely
set
to
export
figures
bounce
around
quite
a
bit
from
week
to
week
but
the
trend
has
been
sharply
up
over
the
past
year
rising
from
the
level
to
routinely
topping
million
barrels
per
day
more
recently
the
latest
week
put
crude
exports
above
for
the
first
time
obviously
the
surge
in
shale
production
is
a
large
part
of
the
reason
refiners
have
swallowed
up
a
large
portion
of
the
enormous
increase
in
shale
supply
over
the
past
few
years
but
there
is
a
limit
to
how
much
they
can
take
on
moreover
the
type
of
oil
that
refiners
can
handle
is
not
perfectly
suited
to
the
type
of
oil
coming
out
of
texas
shale
fields
many
of
the
gulf
coast
refiners
are
best
equipped
to
handle
medium
and
heavy
types
of
oil
while
shale
drillers
are
extracting
light
and
sweet
oil
from
west
texas
that
leaves
a
lot
left
over
for
a
strong
driver
of
higher
oil
exports
recently
is
the
discount
for
american
crude
the
discount
of
wti
to
brent
has
widened
this
year
from
around
per
barrel
in
early
to
a
much
more
pronounced
discount
recently
in
late
april
the
discount
hit
per
barrel
and
by
the
discount
exploded
to
about
per
barrel
related
the
regulations
that
could
push
oil
up
to
discount
has
continued
to
widen
as
the
conditions
between
the
american
market
and
the
rest
of
the
world
diverge
opec
is
keeping
barrels
off
of
the
market
helping
to
drain
inventories
back
to
average
levels
the
supply
losses
in
venezuela
and
angola
have
tightened
the
market
faster
than
most
analysts
expected
plus
the
potential
losses
from
iran
because
of
sanctions
have
also
led
to
supply
fears
all
of
this
has
put
a
premium
on
brent
relative
to
in
the
the
story
is
the
same
that
it
has
been
for
the
past
year
shale
continues
to
add
new
supply
at
an
amazing
rate
to
be
sure
pipeline
bottlenecks
could
significantly
slow
that
growth
rate
but
any
curtailment
in
supply
has
yet
to
show
up
in
the
end
result
is
that
cheap
american
crude
makes
it
exceptionally
attractive
to
foreign
buyers
an
discount
is
definitely
large
enough
to
cover
the
transit
costs
of
shipping
oil
over
long
distances
to
asia
oil
exports
to
asia
are
expected
to
hit
a
record
high
in
july
according
to
reuters
after
hitting
a
record
high
in
may
at
close
to
million
barrels
reuters
cites
data
from
oil
traders
who
note
that
close
to
supertankers
each
carrying
million
barrels
are
queued
up
to
load
oil
in
the
before
they
set
sail
for
wti
midland
is
coming
across
an
unnamed
oil
trader
told
reuters
wti
midland
can
now
compete
against
middle
eastern
oil
in
asia
wti
midland
trades
at
a
premium
to
dubai
benchmark
quotes
for
delivery
in
asia
although
there
are
significant
differences
in
hurdle
for
higher
oil
exports
of
crude
oil
is
the
inability
of
gulf
coast
ports
to
handle
very
large
crude
carriers
vlccs
ports
along
the
gulf
coast
are
inland
and
don
t
have
the
width
or
depth
to
handle
such
large
ships
most
gulf
coast
oil
ports
can
handle
aframax
vessels
which
carry
to
million
barrels
but
the
number
of
ports
that
can
handle
even
suezmax
ships
to
million
barrels
is
limited
according
to
the
eia
vlccs
at
up
to
million
barrels
are
simply
too
export
oil
from
these
ports
smaller
ships
are
used
to
ferry
oil
from
the
port
out
to
a
vlcc
but
that
adds
time
and
costs
which
means
that
in
order
to
economically
support
crude
exports
from
these
terminals
a
wider
discount
is
now
only
the
louisiana
offshore
oil
port
loop
can
handle
vlccs
and
that
port
only
brought
that
capability
online
in
february
weekly
exports
of
crude
oil
have
surpassed
million
four
times
so
far
in
and
trade
press
reports
indicate
two
of
those
weeks
of
february
and
march
with
weeks
in
which
loop
loaded
a
vlcc
for
export
the
eia
wrote
in
a
report
on
may
upgrades
to
a
handful
of
other
ports
on
the
gulf
coast
are
in
the
works
but
those
will
take
time
to
reach
the
price
differential
between
wti
and
brent
narrow
there
could
be
a
cap
placed
on
the
volume
of
crude
exports
leaving
the
however
for
now
the
discount
is
wide
enough
leaving
the
window
open
for
higher
oil
