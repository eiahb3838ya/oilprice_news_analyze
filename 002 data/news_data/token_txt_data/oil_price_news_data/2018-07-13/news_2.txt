is the oil industry repeating a critical error
ten
years
ago
this
to
be
price
of
a
barrel
of
oil
on
the
new
york
mercantile
exchange
hit
an
intraday
high
of
its
highest
price
ever
by
the
following
autumn
the
world
economy
was
in
shambles
and
the
price
of
oil
was
tumbling
the
oil
price
eventually
bottomed
out
around
per
barrel
in
the
following
prices
started
at
around
per
barrel
and
then
rose
almost
continuously
until
as
they
rose
the
world
best
known
critic
of
peak
prognostications
daniel
yergin
began
to
look
so
foolish
for
having
predicted
ample
supplies
for
decades
to
come
that
his
firm
finally
reversed
itself
in
and
began
to
forecast
higher
prices
that
should
have
been
read
as
a
contrarian
signal
just
two
months
later
the
oil
bull
market
oil
thinkers
at
the
time
believed
that
their
forecast
of
a
nearby
peak
in
the
rate
of
world
oil
production
had
been
fulfilled
the
official
numbers
seemed
to
confirm
this
petroleum
geologist
kenneth
deffeyes
had
made
a
prediction
that
thanksgiving
day
would
mark
the
high
for
production
production
of
crude
oil
including
lease
condensate
which
is
the
definition
of
oil
was
slightly
more
than
million
barrels
per
day
mbpd
in
december
but
thereafter
high
and
rising
prices
oil
production
failed
to
exceed
that
number
for
two
years
in
december
production
inched
above
the
previous
high
mark
and
stayed
there
through
july
the
month
the
oil
price
peaked
that
month
the
world
produced
slightly
more
than
august
production
fell
by
more
than
one
million
barrels
and
did
not
surmount
mbpd
until
two
years
demand
in
an
era
of
stagnant
supply
had
sent
prices
spiraling
upward
those
high
prices
became
a
contributory
cause
of
the
worst
economic
calamity
since
the
great
depression
a
moment
of
high
drama
seemed
to
coincide
with
the
peak
oil
moment
in
world
what
if
peak
oil
is
a
process
rather
than
a
moment
a
process
with
a
series
of
twists
and
turns
filled
with
sometimes
ambiguous
and
counterintuitive
signals
if
so
it
might
look
something
like
what
the
economy
rebounded
and
oil
prices
rebounded
with
it
the
peak
oil
thesis
seemed
reconfirmed
the
international
energy
agency
had
noted
in
its
world
energy
outlook
page
that
the
rate
of
production
of
conventional
oil
had
in
fact
peaked
in
and
that
unconventional
supplies
would
thereafter
have
to
provide
the
world
oil
supply
it
turned
out
world
oil
production
plateaued
bouncing
between
and
mbpd
until
late
not
surprisingly
this
constrained
supply
brought
on
high
prices
in
fact
the
years
through
experienced
the
highest
ever
average
daily
prices
for
crude
oil
higher
than
the
average
for
the
year
of
the
price
fact
however
was
obscured
by
the
fawning
media
coverage
of
increasing
supplies
of
shale
oil
in
the
united
states
properly
called
tight
oil
which
did
little
to
stem
the
price
lonely
voice
petroleum
geologist
and
consultant
art
berman
pointed
out
that
the
companies
drilling
for
this
oil
were
almost
all
free
cash
flow
as
oil
prices
levitated
over
per
barrel
and
stayed
there
free
cash
flow
is
operating
cash
flow
minus
capital
expenditures
berman
said
the
economics
just
did
support
bringing
the
shale
oil
out
of
the
ground
but
investors
did
listen
and
kept
handing
new
investment
capital
in
the
form
of
both
equity
and
debt
financing
to
the
drillers
without
this
capital
the
drillers
would
not
have
been
able
to
continue
growing
their
production
since
their
operating
cash
flow
from
existing
wells
came
nowhere
near
the
amount
needed
to
grow
we
know
that
berman
was
right
this
fact
became
more
apparent
when
oil
prices
declined
in
and
kept
going
down
several
drillers
went
bust
but
even
as
much
of
the
industry
remains
on
life
support
those
companies
currently
drilling
in
the
permian
basin
in
texas
are
involved
in
yet
another
bizzare
boom
the
permian
has
become
a
wall
street
darling
even
though
it
actually
the
latest
place
where
capital
goes
to
countries
canada
and
the
united
states
have
been
largely
responsible
for
growth
in
world
oil
production
since
the
extra
oil
came
mostly
from
the
tar
sands
in
canada
and
the
tight
oil
fields
of
the
united
states
oil
production
rose
smartly
in
both
countries
as
long
as
prices
stayed
aloft
but
the
price
decline
that
began
in
and
ended
with
brent
crude
at
on
january
caused
canadian
output
to
stagnate
and
production
to
in
both
countries
has
now
rebounded
with
production
eclipsing
the
production
peaks
of
the
previous
boom
almost
all
production
growth
is
coming
from
the
permian
basin
in
texas
where
a
drilling
frenzy
fueled
by
the
flood
of
new
capital
mentioned
above
analysis
of
the
permian
details
financial
conditions
that
no
peak
oil
thinker
could
ever
have
imagined
let
take
a
few
moments
to
see
why
this
is
do
crude
producers
really
want
higher
oil
prices
one
of
the
criticisms
of
peak
oil
thinking
is
that
it
does
take
into
account
economic
factors
a
second
criticism
is
that
it
fails
to
recognize
unconventional
oil
resources
such
as
tar
sands
tight
oil
heavy
oil
and
arctic
oil
both
criticisms
are
false
at
least
as
they
apply
to
the
thinkers
such
as
petroleum
geologist
colin
far
back
as
campbell
recognized
that
high
oil
prices
would
dampen
oil
consumption
and
delay
or
draw
out
the
peak
but
neither
he
nor
other
thinkers
believed
that
unconventional
oil
resources
could
do
anything
more
than
soften
the
rate
of
decline
in
worldwide
production
the
reason
was
that
such
resources
would
be
expensive
and
difficult
to
extract
and
would
therefore
not
enter
the
market
quickly
enough
to
overcome
the
decline
of
conventional
oil
here
is
what
peak
oil
thinkers
could
foresee
that
investors
would
subsidize
the
production
of
vast
amounts
of
oil
rather
than
seeking
a
return
on
their
capital
and
that
they
would
do
this
year
after
year
even
in
the
face
of
the
obvious
financial
evidence
essentially
wall
street
has
been
subsidizing
the
consumption
of
oil
on
main
this
is
unsustainable
is
obvious
eventually
investors
will
realize
that
there
is
no
value
in
tight
oil
for
now
the
flood
of
oil
from
tight
oil
formations
has
conjured
the
illusion
that
the
world
need
worry
about
oil
supplies
anymore
because
of
the
miracle
of
hydraulic
fracturing
often
referred
to
as
fracking
why
investors
have
been
cautious
about
additional
investment
in
the
canadian
tar
sands
but
not
american
tight
oil
is
a
truly
puzzling
question
the
recent
rebound
in
oil
prices
should
spur
some
investment
elsewhere
especially
where
genuine
financial
returns
await
but
the
punishing
price
decline
in
oil
from
to
and
the
slow
recovery
that
followed
has
resulted
in
deep
cuts
in
exploration
and
development
throughout
the
industry
if
not
so
much
in
the
tight
oil
fields
response
the
international
energy
agency
has
been
waving
its
arms
for
some
time
that
this
dearth
of
investment
will
mean
constrained
supplies
after
in
addition
rystad
energy
an
independent
energy
research
firm
reported
at
the
end
of
last
year
that
saw
a
record
low
in
oil
discoveries
it
noted
that
exploration
expenditures
had
dropped
percent
from
to
without
a
substantial
reversal
of
this
trend
the
firm
expects
supply
deficits
translation
there
wo
be
enough
oil
to
go
around
in
the
future
meanwhile
writer
gail
tverberg
has
been
pounding
home
her
counterintuitive
thesis
that
peak
world
oil
production
wo
be
accompanied
by
high
prices
rather
it
will
be
the
result
of
prices
too
low
for
much
of
the
remaining
oil
to
be
extracted
profitably
in
other
words
in
tverberg
opinion
there
is
an
oil
price
that
is
both
low
enough
to
avoid
economic
stagnation
a
price
that
consumers
can
readily
afford
and
yet
high
enough
to
incentivize
oil
companies
to
extract
sufficient
quantities
of
oil
to
prevent
a
decline
in
the
overall
rate
of
production
seems
the
first
part
of
her
analysis
is
proving
correct
with
regard
to
tight
oil
production
and
probably
tar
sands
deepwater
and
arctic
oil
but
the
fact
that
tight
oil
extraction
remains
by
and
large
free
cash
flow
negative
and
yet
continues
to
attract
investment
has
obscured
her
underlying
financial
the
new
oil
cartel
threatening
opecinvestors
however
wo
keep
subsidizing
expensive
tight
oil
extraction
for
the
benefit
of
the
masses
indefinitely
as
economist
herbert
stein
once
said
if
something
ca
go
on
forever
it
will
stop
when
it
does
stop
one
of
three
things
will
emerge
the
first
result
seems
unlikely
as
innovation
cycles
are
very
long
in
the
oil
industry
sometimes
taking
years
to
reach
maturity
the
second
is
possible
only
in
the
longer
term
and
only
if
countries
worldwide
put
themselves
on
the
equivalent
of
a
war
footing
to
speed
up
their
transformation
the
third
result
seems
the
most
probable
outcome
as
the
lack
of
investment
in
oil
exploration
is
likely
to
show
up
in
two
to
three
the
next
oil
crisis
will
mark
the
peak
in
worldwide
oil
production
is
unknowable
if
it
does
the
reprieve
provided
by
what
we
now
know
has
been
tight
oil
will
have
been
a
dangerous
that
delayed
a
transition
away
from
oil
when
the
price
spike
of
and
the
record
high
prices
of
the
early
part
of
this
decade
should
have
made
clear
that
such
a
transition
was
urgent
for
the
uninitiated
peak
oil
in
this
context
refers
to
the
moment
in
time
when
the
worldwide
rate
of
oil
production
reaches
a
peak
and
thereafter
enters
a
permanent
but
possibly
bumpy
decline
it
does
not
as
many
wrongly
claim
mean
the
world
will
run
out
of
oil
in
fact
oil
will
continue
to
be
pumped
as
long
as
human
society
has
a
need
for
it
and
can
afford
its
extraction
the
cost
of
using
oil
as
our
main
energy
source
however
may
be
too
great
for
the
economy
to
bear

the
long
run
