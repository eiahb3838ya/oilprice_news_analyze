chinese oil demand growth could slow down soon
oil
demand
growth
in
the
world
s
biggest
oil
at
risk
of
slowing
down
at
least
in
the
coming
months
higher
oil
prices
play
a
role
in
this
but
the
main
culprit
is
a
new
tighter
tax
regime
on
independent
chinese
refiners
which
is
already
choking
the
refining
margins
and
profits
of
the
teapots
who
have
grown
over
the
past
three
years
to
account
for
around
a
fifth
of
china
s
total
crude
imports
the
teapots
have
become
instrumental
in
china
s
growing
thirst
for
crude
oil
after
the
government
started
allocating
import
quotas
to
the
independent
refiners
in
the
stricter
tax
regulations
and
reporting
mechanisms
effective
march
however
the
teapots
now
can
t
avoid
paying
consumption
tax
on
refined
oil
product
they
did
in
the
past
three
their
profit
bonanza
is
coming
to
an
end
despite
ample
crude
import
quotas
independent
refiners
are
now
losing
money
on
refining
cutting
utilizations
rates
and
closing
for
maintenance
to
cut
exposure
to
the
unfavorable
market
conditions
with
higher
oil
prices
this
year
and
the
hefty
taxes
they
now
can
t
avoid
paying
the
teapots
are
expected
to
reduce
their
imports
threatening
china
s
oil
demand
growth
and
ultimately
global
oil
demand

alone
the
independents
accounted
for
percent
of
china
s
crude
oil
import
growth
according
to
data
by

p
global
china
issued
last
week
its
second
batch
of
crude
oil
import
quotas
to
independent
refiners
for
the
teapots
are
unlikely
to
use
up
all
their
quotas
this
year
because
it
wouldn
t
make
business
sense
to
refine
crude
at
a
loss
just
to
have
quotas
fully
utilized
to
make
sure
that
they
would
qualify
for
quotas
next
year

opec
won
t
take
additional
action
as
oil
prices
rise
refining
is
a
business
if
processing
crude
results
in
losses
now
it
is
unwise
to
take
more
crude
just
for
securing
quotas
for
the
coming
year

a

a

to

some
of

conditions
persist
according
to

that
crude

imports
by
the

a

independent
