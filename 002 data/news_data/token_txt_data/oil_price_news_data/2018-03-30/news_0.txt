geopolitical
pressure
is
only
able
to
influence
oil
prices
to
such
a
degree
because
the
market
is
fundamentally
getting
declines
in
venezuela
and
concerns
about
heightened
tension
between
the

iran
have
significantly
raised
the

another

still
the

wasn

exactly
bearish
although
crude
stocks
rose
they
increased

of

but
it
doesn

be
swamping
the
market
at

as

a
variety
of
analysts
have
argued
that
oil
demand
is
so
strong
that
the
market
will
continue
to
tighten
even
after
considering
the
explosive
growth
of
shale
this
year
will
be
the
eighth
year
of
continuous
growth
since
the

crisis
and
the
seventh
consecutive

of

about

some
of
the

weakness
in

prices
lately
can
be
chalked
up
to
fears
of
a
trade
war
which
could

the

the
uptick
in

prices
at

this

some
analysts
say
are
at

in

a

lent

concerns

global
equities
on

oil
prices
rebounded
while
these
factors
no
doubt
played
a
role
in
pushing
up
crude
benchmarks
they
are
occurring
against
a
backdrop
of
a
tighter
oil
market
the
surplus
of
oecd
inventories
is
now
below
million
barrels
whereas
it
was
above
million
barrels
a
year
the
iea
sees
the
oil
market
tipping
into
a
supply
deficit
as
soon
as
this
quarter
and
inventory
drawdowns
will
pick
up
pace

the

are
only
playing
one
part
in
this
commerzbank
said
in
a
note
the
involuntary
production
outages
in
venezuela
are
weighing
more
heavily
as
they
mean
that
opec
is
reducing
its
output
by
considerably
more
than
originally
related
building
the
world
s
largest
solar
projectas
long
as
opec
keeps
the
current
production
limits
in
place
the
oil
market
will
continue
to
tighten
even
after
taking
into
account
shale
growth
and
opec
has
even
signaled
that
it
is
considering
extending
the
cuts
for
another
six
months
pushing
the
expiration
date
to
if
they
follow
through
on
that
there
is
a
pretty
decent
chance
that
there
is
a
lot
more
room
on
the
upside
for
oil
there
are
a
handful
of
uncertainties
that
would
completely
upend
any
reasonable
oil
forecast
on
the
bearish
side
if
opec
somehow
abandons
its
cuts
begins
a
phase
out
sooner
than
expected
revised
the
deal
to
account
for
sharp
declines
in
venezuela
or
members
simply
started
cheating
then
oil
prices
could
slide
arguably
there
are
more
upside
risks
the
most
dangerous
is
the
likely
return
of
sanctions
on
iran
from
the
which
could
curtail
a
significant
chunk
of
supply
worse
the
trump
administration
could
head
down
a
dangerous
road
that
ends
in
war
meanwhile
venezuela
s
oil
production
continues
to
fall
off
a
short
because
shale
growth
is
already
baked
into
the
current
oil
market
projections
the
risk
to
oil
prices
is
probably
skewed
more
towards
the
upside
due
to
the
variety
of
geopolitical
ticking
