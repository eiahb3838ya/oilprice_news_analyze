what crashing refining margins mean for oil markets
oil
prices
have
plunged
to
lows
but
refiners
in
certain
parts
of
the
are
not
benefitting
from
cheaper

new
data
from
the

refining
margins
for
motor
gasoline
have
fallen
to

flattening
growth
in
gasoline
demand
in
the
united
states
combined
with
high
levels
of
refinery
output
have
contributed
to
low

for

and

gasoline

have
been
declining

meanwhile
prices
for
distillates
such
as
diesel
are
much
higher
the
discrepancy
is
notable
and
the
markets
for
gasoline
and
distillates
have
diverged
sharply
this
year
the
forthcoming
international
maritime
organization
regulations
on
sulfur
content
in
maritime
fuels
is
set
to
push
extremely
dirty
heavy
fuel
oil
out
of
the
mix
for
one
of
the
most
important
replacements
for
fuel
oil
be
diesel
and
gasoil
in
other
words
distillate
demand
is
set
to
spike
at
the
start
of
in
anticipation
of
these
regulations
distillate
prices
are
seeing
upward
diesel
prices
on
the
rise
and
gasoline
prices
heading
in
the
other
direction
refiners
might
want
to
maximize
diesel
output
however
things
aren
t
that
simple
as
the
eia
notes
for
every
barrel
of
crude
oil
processed
in
a
refinery
it
tends
to
yield
twice
as
much
gasoline
as
it
does
diesel
as
a
result
although
gasoline
margins
have
been
low
recently
refiners
can
not
completely
stop
making
gasoline
in
favor
of
other
petroleum
products
such
as
distillate
the
eia

but
because
diesel
prices
are
favorable
refiners
are
simply
churning
out
product
as
quickly
as
possible
which
is
exacerbating
the
emerging
supply
glut
of
wouldn
t
necessarily
be
a
huge
problem
except
that
gasoline
demand
has
stalled
out
in
the
united
states
part
of
that
is
the
hangover
from
higher
fuel
prices
earlier
this
summer
in
essence
refiners
are
chasing
diesel
dumping
gasoline
onto
the
market
at
a
time
when
consumers
have
been
pulling
back
the
result
has
been
gasoline
supply
outpacing
demand
which
translated
into
unusually
large
storage
as
peak
summer
demand
season
gives
way
to
autumn
refiners
go
offline
for
maintenance
which
leads
to
a
drawdown
in
gasoline
stocks
but
the
combination
of
refining
runs
and
weak
demand
meant
that
gasoline
inventories
held
up
through
legendary

trader

crude
prices
to

complicate
matters
further
much
of
the
surging
oil
production
the
permian
basin
is
light
in
quality
which
means
that
it
tends
to
be
better
suited
for
gasoline
production
rather
than
recent
plunge
in
crude
oil
is
starting
to
trickle
down
into
lower
pump
prices
which
could
yet
provide
a
bit
of
a
spark
to
demand
indeed
in
the
most
recent
data
release
from
the
eia
gasoline
stocks
edged
down
continuing
a
downward
trend
since
october
still
gasoline
inventories
are
at
the
upper
end
of
the
average
range
at
million
barrels
for
the
week
ending
on
november
the
upshot
of
the
differences
between
gasoline
and
diesel
markets
is
that
refining
margins
for
gasoline
have
steadily
declined
over
the
past
few
months
the
eia
forecasts
margins
to
remain
low
during
the
winter
before
rebounding
and
following
their
normal
seasonal
patterns
heading
into
the
summer
driving
it
will
be
interesting
see
how
this
affects
various
refiners
and
even
the
integrated
oil
companies
during
the
oil
market
downturn
that
began
in
the
oil
majors
suffered
from
low
crude
prices
but
did
better
than
upstream
producers
because
they
had
their
refining
units
to
cushion
the
blow
cheap
crude
stoked
demand
for
motor
fuels
and
the
oil
majors
benefiting
from
very
large
margins
on
time
around
the
narrowing
margins
for
gasoline
is
since
it
is
also
occurring
alongside
a
downturn
in
crude
prices
as
the
eia
notes
this
is
likely
temporary
but
it
wasn
t
so
long
ago
that
most
analysts
and
industry
executives
saw
shaping
up
to
be
a
hugely
positive
year
the
simultaneous
meltdown
in
refining
margins
and
crude
oil
prices
