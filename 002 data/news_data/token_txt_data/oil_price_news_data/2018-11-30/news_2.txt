are oil markets about to turn around?
despite
hitting
its
lowest
level
in
over
a
year
earlier
in
the
week
crude
oil
is
showing
signs
of
stabilizing
this
is
perhaps
an
early
indication
that
the
worst
of
the
selling
may
be
over
with
crude
oil
sentiment
is
being
influenced
by
expectations
of
production
cuts
by
opec
and
its
west
texas
intermediate
crude
oil
futures
is
currently
in
a
position
to
post
a
potentially
bullish
technical
closing
price
reversal
bottom
on
the
weekly
chart
helping
to
form
the
chart
pattern
is
thursday
s
rapid
reversal
to
the
upside
on
the
daily
chart
this
move
was
fueled
after
industry
sources
said
russia
had
accepted
the
need
to
cut
production
together
with
opec
ahead
of
its
meeting
in
vienna
on
december
the
start
of
the
week
crude
oil
was
in
a
position
to
post
one
of
its
biggest
declines
in
november
since
the
worst
of
the
financial
crisis
in
having
dropped
about
percent
so
far
primarily
driving
the
price
action
this
month
has
been
increasing
supply
by
the
united
states
and
saudi
changes
its
tuneafter
crude
oil
fell
below
for
the
first
time
in
over
a
year
the
news
hit
that
russia
would
consider
joining
opec
and
other
producers
to
cut
output
this
triggered
the
technical
reversal
in
the
reaction
by
traders
to
the
news
about
russia
was
primarily
driven
by
but
nonetheless
it
is
a
good
sign
that
the
buying
may
be
greater
than
the
selling
