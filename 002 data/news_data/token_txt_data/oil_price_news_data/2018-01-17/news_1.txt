cnpc expects robust oil demand growth in china
china
s
oil
and
gas
giant
cnpc
has
just
added
fuel
to
already
strong
optimism
on
oil
markets
by
forecasting
that
crude
oil
demand
in
china
will
jump
by
percent
this
year
to
million
barrels
per
imports
the
news
is
even
better
for
producers
cnpc
sees
net
crude
oil
imports
at
percent
above
levels
to
million
metric
tons
or
about
million
barrels
per
day
the
forecast
is
based
on
estimated
gdp
expansion
of
percent
slightly
down
from
percent
in
year
china
overtook
the
united
states
as
the
world
s
largest
oil
importer
with
its
dependency
on
imports
reaching
percent
this
year
this
could
climb
further
to
percent
even
if
there
is
a
recovery
in
domestic
is
some
bad
news
for
refiners
in
the
rest
of
asia
however
cnpc
s
economics
and
technology
research
institute
which
compiled
the
report
expects
net
oil
product
exports
export
minus
imports
this
year
to
soar
by
almost
a
third
to
million
tons
with
diesel
exports
shooting
up
by
percent
thanks
to
higher
export
domestic
chinese
market
is
in
a
glut
of
oil
products
so
higher
quotas
are
very
likely
to
be
allowed
to
relieve
it
however
this
will
undermine
the
margins
of
other
asian
refiners
who
are
already
facing
an
uphill
battle
because
of
more
expensive
crude
oil
related
the
labor
shortage
in
the
shale
boomadding
insult
to
injury
chinese
refiners
have
plans
to
add
some
million
metric
tons
in
annual
refining
capacity
which
equals
about
bpd
the
country
s
total
then
will
reach
million
tons
annually
or
million
barrels
of
this
additional
capacity
will
come
from
the
teapots
whose
role
in
china
s
energy
market
is
becoming
increasingly
prominent
with
this
additional
capacity
the
independent
refiners
will
come
to
account
for
a
third
of
the
country
s
refining
capacity
which
by
will
rise
