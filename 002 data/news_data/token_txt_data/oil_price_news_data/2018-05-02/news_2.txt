oil prices slip on large crude inventory build
after
yesterday
the
american
petroleum
institute
served
a
not
so
pleasant
surprise
to
oil
bulls
by
reporting
a
increase
in
crude
oil
inventories
in
the
united
states
the
energy
information
administration
confirmed
the
bad
news
estimating
a
increase
in
oil
inventories
for
the
week
to
april
processed
million
bpd
of
crude
producing
million
barrels
per
day
of
gasoline
and
million
barrels
of
distillate
this
compares
to
million
bpd
of
gasoline
and
million
bpd
of
distillate
a
week
inventories
increased
by
million
barrels
last
week
after
an
increase
a
week
earlier
distillate
stockpiles
were
down
by
million
barrels
compared
with
a
decline
a
week
traded

us

wti
was
slightly
up
from
yesterday
s
close
while
brent
was
down
a
third
of
a
percentage
markets
anticipate
that
president
trump
will
decide
to
pull
out
of
the
iran
nuclear
deal
which
would
lead
to
a
spike
in
prices
although
how
high
a
spike
it
will
be
is
anyone
s
guess
the
decision
has
been
expected
for
a
few
weeks
trump
might
just
surprise
everyone
by
deciding
to
stay
in
the
deal
despite
alleged
evidence
that
iran
lied
about
its
nuclear
program
which
was
revealed
publicly
by
israel
s
pm
benjamin
netanyahu
if
this
happens
prices
will
definitely
correct
production
will
also
have
a
negative
impact
on
price
developments
when
the
eia
releases
its
full
weekly
petroleum
report
later
in
the
day
last
week
the
daily
average
stood
at
million
barrels
making
the
the
producer
globally
behind
only
russia
with
million
bpd
yet
it
is
possible
that
the
will
overtake
russia
relatively
soon
since
the
start
of
daily
production
has
grown
by
more
than
