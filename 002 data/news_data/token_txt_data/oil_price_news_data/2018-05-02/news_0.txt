texas sees unparalleled economic boom from oil prices
is
like
the
new
dallas
fed
economist
michael
plante
told
reuters
last
month
commenting
on
the
effect
of
the
oil
prices
on
the
texas
production
in
the
only
shale
play
whose
output
didn
t
decline
during
the
now
booming
and
is
fueling
the
economic
growth
in
west
texas
cities
of
midland
and
odessa
employment
is
near
highs
unemployment
is
at
record
lows
home
sales
building
permits
and
hotel
revenues
are
surging
wages
are
up
and
so
are
residents
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
boom
won
t
last
forever
but
right
now
the
economy
is
booming
as
is
oil
production
in
west
eia
estimates
that
the
permian
production
hit
million
bpd
in
april
and
is
set
to
rise
to
million
bpd
in
highest
increase
among
the
main
shale
to
the
latest
dallas
fed
energy
survey
executives
from
exploration
and
production
firms
put
the
average
breakeven
prices
to
profitably
drill
a
new
well
at
a
barrel
for
midland
in
the
lowest
among
all
oil
basins
for
existing
wells
the
survey
found
that
midland
s
average
oil
price
to
cover
operating
expenses
was
a
barrel
with
responses
ranging
from
just
over
to
as
much
per
barrel
oil
midland
s
average
breakeven
for
existing
wells
is
again
the
lowest
in
the
united
states
related
is
the
golden
era
for
renewables
around
the
corner
the
cities
of
midland
and
odessa
in
the
permian
are
now
booming
in
lockstep
with
the
oil
production
in
the
early
as
in
october
last
year
midland
ranked
fifth
in
the
cities
in
the
ranking
by
wallethub
which
compared
cities
of
varying
population
sizes
based
on
two
key
dimensions
sociodemographics
and
jobs
economy
midland
ranked
fourth
in
terms
of
midsize
cities
with
the
highest
bureau
of
labor
statistics
said
in
march
in
its
county
employment
and
wages
summary
that
midland
texas
had
the
largest
percentage
increase
in
employment
between
september
and
september
above
the
national
job
growth
rate
of
percent
in
midland
the
biggest
jump
in
employment
was
in
natural
resources
and
mining
which
gained
jobs
in
the
year
through
september
recent
data
as
of
february
shows
that
midland
employment
increased
by
percent
in
february
from
a
year
ago
and
unemployment
rate
dropped
to
percent
from
percent
in
february
taxable
spending
car
purchases
hotel
and
motel
receipts
sales
of
existing
homes
and
permits
for
new
homes
all
surged
this
year
compared
to
record
low
unemployment
however
is
a
headache
for
business
only
in
oil
and
struggle
to
find
enough
local
staff
for
construction
projects
and
restaurants
for
example
midland
mayor
jerry
morales
told
unemployment
rate
in
odessa
texas
dropped
to
percent
in
february
from
percent
in
february
the
oil
industry
remains
in
sharp
recovery
mode
in
the
region
though
and
is
pushing
general
economic
growth
to
ever
higher
and
soon
to
be
record
levels
according
to
economist
karr
ingham
at
and
direct
oil
gas
employment
which
did
decline
during
the
contraction
is
rapidly
increasing
and
has
very
nearly
reached
the
high
point
and
should
do
so
in
the
coming
month
or
two
according
to
the
rig
count
drilling
permits
well
completions
and
prices
remain
well
below
the
peak
levels
but
this
is
not
to
suggest
the
industry
is
in
the
midst
of
a
slow
recovery
as
it
tries
to
crawl
its
way
back
to
the
salad
days
of
the
previous
expansion
it
does
suggest
that
efficiencies
have
improved
so
greatly
that
those
levels
of
activity
are
not
presently
needed
to
produce
more
petroleum
in
the
permian
basin
than
has
ever
been
produced
before
said
ingham
related
cheap
hydrogen
could
soon
become
a
reality
the
record
permian
production
however
has
started
to
create
bottlenecks
in
the

shale
a
shortage
of
crews
frac
sand
roads
trucks

takeaway
capacity
and
increased

midland

the
recovery
from

magnificent

the

accomplished
