chinaâ€™s growing oil demand has created a geopolitical dilemma
china
has
become
the
world
s
largest
oil
importer
and
despite
establishing
the
largely
successful
oil
futures
beijing
will
have
to
grapple
with
an
overlooked
geopolitical
and
economic
consequence
as
it
seeks
to
quench
its
thirst
for
oil
and
china
relies
more
on
both
foreign
crude
oil
imports
and
imported
gas
in
the
form
of
lng
and
piped
gas
from
neighboring
countries
the
outflow
of
or
in
this
case
will
see
the
country
contend
with
the
dilemma
that
the
faced
a
massive
transfer
of
capital
to
foreign
oil
yet
for
the
at
the
time
of
its
foreign
oil
import
dependence
the
transfer
of
funds
was
often
to
middle
eastern
oil
producers
including
saudi
arabia
who
in
the
and
could
arguably
have
been
called
a
or
at
least
an
ally
of
convenience
the
needed
saudi
oil
as
american
oil
production
continued
to
decline
while
oil
consumption
spiked
to
unprecedented
levels

their

stockpiling
combined
with

were
the
major
factors

and
from

to

moreover
imports
from
russia
which
passed
saudi
arabia
as
china
largest
source
of
foreign
crude
oil
in
totaled
million
bpd
last
year
while
saudi
arabia
accounted
for
million
bpd
opec
countries
and
some
countries
including

agreed
to
reduce

production
through
the
end
of
which
allowed

countries
to
capture

market
share
in
course
in
the
past
decade
overreliance
on
saudi
and
opec
oil
has
been
offset
in
large
part
due
to
the
wonders
of
the
shale
oil
and
gas
boom
that
has
seen
saudi
oil
imports
to
the
states
reduced
recently
to
lows
not
seen
since
the
question
now
is
will
china
find
itself
in
the
same
foreign
oil
dependence
quandary
as
the
did
from
the
early
until
the
past
decade
all
signs
indicate
that
the
answer
to
this
question
is
a
resounding
sheer
size
of
china
s
economy
its
prolonged
run
of
economic
growth
its
massive
population
and
its
own
oil
and
gas
production
problems
create
a
scenario
that
will
not
only
make
beijing
more
reliant
on
oil
from
unstable
or
geopolitically
volatile
regions
including
iran
nigeria
saudi
arabia
and
other
opec
producers
but
also
from
russia
particularly

and

imports
from

gasthese
dynamics
also
point
to
the
advantage
that
oil
exports
offer
for
not
only
china
but
the
entire
region
security
of
supply
must
be
implemented
into
beijing

even
if
it
is
a
tough
pill
to
swallow

the

do
shale
oil
and
lng
production
offer
enhanced
security
of
supply
as
well
as
a

regulatory
system
and
developed
pipeline
infrastructure
there
are
also
price
incentives
that
are
competitive
over
its

gas
exporting
starters
the
price
spread
between

texas
intermediate
wti
crude
oil
and
brent
crude
and
other
global
benchmarks
presents
an
incentive
for
china
and
others
to
procure
more
light
sweet
crude
for
its
refineries
even
if
some
of
those
refiners
are
not
configured
to
process
light
grades
it
can
be
used
as
a
blend
with
other
crude
types
yielding
higher
profitable
finished
products
like

gasoline
kerosene
and
far
as
lng
goes
the
fact
that

is
an
also
attractive

point
for
supplies
of
the

despite
a
recent
pivot
from
longer

to
shorter

and

the
fact
remains
that
the

of
