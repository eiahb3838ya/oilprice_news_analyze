a crisis at the heart of u.s. shale
the
bottlenecks
in
the
permian
are
starting
to
capture
the
attention
of
the
oil
market
raising
the
prospect
that
shale
production
does
not
live
up
to
the
frenzy
in
west
texas
has
predictably
led
to
bottlenecks
up
and
down
the
supply
chain
oil
drillers
are
facing
rising
prices
for
labor
rigs
services
and
land
the
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
is
starting
to
force
discounts
for
oil
as
large
as
per
new
report
from
rystad
energy
points
to
the
bottleneck
specifically
for
pumping
horsepower
and
frac
sand
when
wells
are
drilled
companies
deploy
trucks
connected
to
pressure
pumps
that
inject
water
sand
and
chemicals
underground
to
fracture
a
well
but
the
level
of
drilling
activity
is
actually
straining
the
market
for
pressure
pumping
capacity
there
just
isn
t
enough
to
go
capacity
is
expected
to
be
particularly
tight
in
the
permian
in
the
second
quarter
before
the
majority
of
new
equipment
comes
online
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
rystad
energy
wrote
in
its
report
more
than
half
of
total
pumping
capacity
will
be
in
the
obviously
that
means
booming
business
if
you
are
in
the
market
of
selling
such
equipment
we
are
comfortably
behind
at
the
moment
and
we
are
just
fine
with
that
a
vp
at
an
unnamed
equipment
manufacturer
told
be
sure
rystad
energy
predicts
that
million
horsepower
of
new
capacity
will
come
online
by
the
end
of
the
year
a
nearly
increase
from
that
should
help
relieve
some
of
the
canada
s
oil
patch
to
turn
profitable
in
market
for
frac
sand
is
also
stretched
to
the
limit
but
that
too
should
be
temporary
rystad
energy
sees
the
supply
of
frac
sand
jumping
by
a
massive
million
tons
in
much
of
it
located
in
the
permian
in
close
proximity
to
drilling
sites
which
is
different
from
the
past
when
much
of
the
sand
had
to
be
shipped
to
texas
from
wisconsin
and
moving
all
that
sand
around
requires
a
lot
of
trucks
and
the
market
for
trucks
is
also
tight
to
top
it
off
a
zillion
trucks
moving
around
wears
down
roads
which
ultimately
could
create
bottlenecks
for
sand
you
re
going
to
see
similar
problems
as
to
what
happened
in
the
eagle
ford
years
back
roads
get
chewed
up
and
no
one
wants
to
have
them
shut
down
for
repairs
an
official
from
an
e
p
company
told
vp
agreed
telling
rystad
that
it
s
not
just
the
quality
of
roads
anymore
it
s
the
number
of
roads
i
just
don
t
think
there
are
enough
roads
to
service
this
kind
of
demand
without
traffic
jams
of
semis
all
over
the
however
the
most
critical
bottleneck
this
year
could
be
for
pipeline
capacity
permian
oil
production
is
set
to
hit
million
barrels
per
day
in
may
while
pipeline
capacity
is
expected
to
average
for
the
year
according
to
the
wall
street
journal
and
goldman
sachs
the
pipelines
are
essentially
full
which
is
why
midland
crude
is
suffering
discounts
additional
supplies
might
need
to
be
moved
by
truck
a
costly
form
of
norway
to
create
thousands
of
jobs
in
arctic
oilall
of
these
constraints
will
add
costs
and
likely
push
up
breakeven
prices
the
wsj
estimates
that
permian
drillers
could
see
production
costs
rise
by
percent
this
year
however
oil
producers
might
ultimately
have
to
throttle
back
on
production
growth
or
even
shut
in
wells
the
backlog
of
drilled
but
uncompleted
wells
ducs
in
the
permian
has
skyrocketed
jumping
to
wells
in
march
up
percent
since
the
start
of
the
year
e
ps
are
opting
not
to
complete
wells
for
a
variety
of
reasons
most
of
which
have
to
do
with
a
shortage
of
completion
crews
or
some
other
supply
chain
bottleneck
roughly
percent
of
supplies
and
equipment
used
to
frack
a
well
in
the
permian
is
booked
up
according
to
matt
johnson
of
primary
vision
as
reported
in
the
there
is
the
gusher
of
natural
gas
coming
out
of
all
of
these
oil
wells
that
could
spell
problems
for
producers
there
are
limits
to
the
amount
of
flaring
allowed
and
without
pipelines
to
take
away
all
of
the
natural
gas
producers
might
have
to
shut
down
bottom
line
is
that
a
whole
series
of
bottlenecks
could
act
as
a
significant
drag
on
the
growth
rate
of
the
permian
basin
and
because
the
permian
is
the
largest
source
of
supply
growth
for
the
entire
world
any
hiccups
will
ripple
across
