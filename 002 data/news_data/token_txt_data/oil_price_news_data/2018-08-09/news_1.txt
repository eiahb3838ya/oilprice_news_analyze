a major setback looms for colorado shale
an
initiative
to
expand
the
setback
distance
required
for
oil
and
gas
drilling
in
colorado
just
received
a
boost
potentially
making
the
november
ballot
the
stricter
drilling
requirements
could
have
significant
implications
for
colorado
shale
drilling
and
the
industry
is
decrying
the
measure
as
a
ban
on
new
would
require
oil
and
gas
wells
to
be
a
minimum
of
feet
away
from
occupied
structures
which
means
houses
and
vulnerable
areas
which
includes
parks
public
spaces
and
fresh
water
among
other
areas
that
distance
is
much
greater
than
the
current
distance
of
just
feet
for
occupied
structures
and
feet
for
high
occupancy
buildings
such
as
hospitals
and
other
words
shale
drillers
would
have
to
place
their
wells
at
a
much
greater
distance
from
local
campaign
to
impose
stricter
drilling
requirements
on
the
oil
and
gas
industry
gained
urgency
last
year
after
an
explosion
from
a
flow
line
attached
to
a
vertical
well
run
by
anadarko
petroleum
and
drilled
by
a
previous
owner
killed
two
people
and
injured
two
others
earlier
this
year
anadarko
settled
with
the
victims
and
survivors
on
undisclosed
flow
line
was
thought
to
be
abandoned
but
it
was
uncapped
and
the
well
was
only
feet
from
the
victims
house
following
the
disaster
anadarko
temporarily
suspended
operations
at
vertical
wells
across
northern
colorado
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
some
of
which
were
subsequently
brought
back
online
after
inspections
related
oil
is
a
very
real
possibilitythe
incident
is
not
directly
related
to
the
drilling
of
new
wells
within
close
proximity
to
houses
and
buildings
but
it
sparked
ire
against
the
oil
and
gas
industry
an
explosion
in
a
residential
area
stemming
from
a
gas
line
has
led
to
growing
opposition
to
a
drilling
presence
right
up
against
homes
and
businesses
and
because
drilling
activity
has
increased
so
dramatically
in
recent
years
public
resistance
has
also
increased
in
corresponding
industry
is
obviously
opposed
to
the
setback
measure
but
organizers
in
favor
of
greater
setback
requirements
apparently
secured
enough
signatures
to
put
the
measure
up
for
a
statewide
referendum
in
november
the
november
election
in
colorado
is
likely
an
inflection
point
for
the
state
s
oil
and
gas
industry
according
to
a
july
research
note
from
height
securities
llc
in
addition
to
the
ballot
measure
control
of
the
state
legislature
and
the
governor
s
mansion
could
potentially
be
in
the
hands
of
the
democrats
although
what
that
means
for
the
industry
is
still
unclear
the
leading
candidate
for
governor
congressman
jared
polis
has
softened
his
opposition
to
oil
and
gas
after
previously
supporting
bans
on
the
ballot
measure
requiring
greater
setbacks
could
have
a
dramatic
effect
in
weld
county
colorado
where
much
of
the
drilling
in
colorado
s
dj
basin
takes
place
the
greater
setback
distances
would
put
roughly
percent
of
the
surface
land
off
limits
to
drilling
according
to
the
colorado
oil
gas
conservation
commission
a
state
regulator
overall
roughly
percent
of
the
state
s
total
land
mass
would
be
off
limits
by
forcing
drillers
to
move
away
from
buildings
and
neighborhoods
many
fewer
locations
would
be
available
to
industry
paints
the
setback
requirements
in
apocalyptic
terms
that
is
effectively
a
ban
on
the
industry
dan
haley
president
of
the
colorado
oil
gas
association
told
bloomberg
in
a
july
interview
you
d
basically
have
no
new
wells
drilled
in
colorado
related
the
shale
boom
that
will
never
happenthe
share
prices
of
companies
that
are
active
in
colorado
s
dj
basin
are
lagging
behind
some
of
their
industry
peers
goldman
sachs
notes
that
the
stocks
of
companies
like
extraction
oil
gas
src
energy
pdc
energy
noble
energy
and
anadarko
petroleum
all
with
a
sizable
drilling
presence
in
the
dj
basin
are
underperforming
a
broader
etf
of
shale
companies
by
to
percent
in
fact
extraction
oil
gas
and
pdc
energy
appear
to
be
the
most
exposed
to
this
referendum
based
on
our
assumed
value
for
their
undrilled
dj
basin
resources
as
a
percent
of
total
company
value
goldman
sachs
wrote
in
a
is
not
a
certainty
that
the
measure
will
qualify
for
the
november
ballot
previous
initiatives
aimed
at
increasing
setback
provisions
came
up
short
in
several
proposed
initiatives
were
withdrawn
after
the
industry
and
local
and
state
governments
reached
a
compromise
to
setup
the
oil
gas
task
force
in
an
initiative
to
grant
local
communities
authorities
to
institute
greater
setback
distances
did
not
qualify
for
the
ballot
after
not
receiving
enough
signatures
ahead
of
the
after
last
year
s
explosion
the
issue
is
resonating
a
lot
more
with
state
residents
moreover
the
setback
provisions
will
not
be
the
only
thing
on
the
ballot
the
midterm
elections
promise
to
turn
out
a
lot
of
voters
