can libya boost oil production to 2 million bpd?
since
the
ousting
and
subsequent
killing
of
muammar
gaddafi
in
libya
s
oil
production
has
remained
below
capacity
with
the
lingering
effects
of
civil
war
the
country
which
is
a
member
of
opec
has
struggled
to
boost
oil
production
in
its
major
oil
fields
despite
registering
an
increased
average
output
of
barrels
daily
in
libya
has
failed
to
attain
the
production
levels
realized
during
gaddafi
s
reign
libya
has
the
largest
proven
oil
reserves
in
africa
with
an
estimated
billion
barrels
in
reserves
the
country
has
also
been
ranked
in
the
world
in
terms
of
existing
oil
reserves
despite
this

libya
was

libya
as
a
key
supplier
of

oil
to
europe
at
the
time
of
gaddafi
s
death
the
country
s
crude
production
sank
to
about
million

currently
libya
is
struggling
to
maintain
a

level
of
million

oil
production
in
libyamuch
of
the
slowdown
in
daily
oil
production
in
libya
relates
to
the
aftermath
of
the
rebel
uprising
backed
by
nato
with
gaddafi
toppled
the
fragmentation
of
power
in
the
country
and
the
use
of
oil
production
facilities
as
bargaining
chips
created
an
adverse
environment
for
oil
the
lawlessness
and
instability
that
ensued
after
gaddafi
s
fall
the
nation
experienced
an
shutdown
in
oil

outages
in
the
giant
sharara
and
el
feel
oil
fields
have
weighed
on
oil
production
and
exports
ever
by
rebel
groups
also
played
a
big
role
in
derailing
oil
production
in
libya
with
the
fragmentation
of
power
different
armed
groups
cut
off
production
in
major
oil
fields
and
to

the
haphazard
shutdown
of
oil
wells
led
to
reduced

pressure
resulting
in
further
instability

hampering

the
security
situation
has
improved

since
oil
production
in
libya
continues
to
face
combination
of
headwinds
armed
groups
seeking
the
release
of
jailed
members
and
political
developments
are
some
of
the
current
factors
affecting
oil
production
with
dwindling
oil
revenues
and
limited
authority
over
armed
groups
the
government
of
national

gna
in

lacks
the
capacity
to
prevent
illegal
shutdowns
and
finance
operations
related
to
this
regard
rebel
groups
within
and
outside
the
capital
still
have
the
ability
to
shut
down
production
remotely
or
at
the
terminals
for
instance
armed
groups
near
the
western
town
of
zintan
have
occasionally
disrupted
production
at
the
