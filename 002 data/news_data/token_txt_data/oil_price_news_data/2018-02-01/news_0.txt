can opec deal with its success?
the
data
is
in
opec
s
success
with
its
oil
production
cuts
is
now
proved
in
fact
the
cartel
and
its
partners
led
by
russia
did
so
well
that
there
are
calls
from
analysts
to
consider
making
it
permanent
but
there
s
always
a
s
no
secret
that
the
excellent
performance
of
opec
and
its
partners
wasn
t
exactly
excellent
across
the
board
some
members
did
more
than
their
fair
share
and
others
didn
t
hit
their
quota
at
all
in
any
the
top
performers
saudi
arabia
and
venezuela
the
former
cut
more
than
it
had
to
in
order
to
make
up
for
laggards
like
iraq
whose
compliance
was
consistently
lower
than
that
of
most
other
members
venezuela
for
its
part
also
overcomplied
but
not
by
choice
its
oil
production
dropped
sharply
in
the
last
couple
of
years
under
the
pressure
of
field
mismanagement
underinvestment
and
also
overcomplied
which
helped
push
opec
s
total
compliance
rate
above
percent
last
year
this
impressed
the
market
and
helped
crude
oil
benchmarks
break
resistance
levels
and
gradually
climb
to
the
coveted
mark
this
achievement
is
all
the
more
impressive
in
light
of
the
fact
that
two
large
opec
producers
libya
and
nigeria
did
not
take
part
in
the
cuts
because
they
were
in
active
oil
industry
recovery
mode
as
a
result
of
this
recovery
bloomberg
gadfly
s
liam
denning
notes
they
offset
one
in
four
barrels
that
the
rest
of
opec
took
off
the
market
last
year
related
goldman
oil
to
top
within
six
monthsin
total
the
production
cut
amounted
to
million
barrels
enough
to
take
care
of
the
global
overhang
but
does
opec
and
its
partners
have
what
it
takes
to
continue
at
the
same
rate
prices
are
a
particularly
good
motivator
although
as
it
turns
out
prices
that
are
too
high
are
equally
as
brent
broke
the
barrier
there
was
talk
that
opec
and
russia
might
want
to
wrap
things
up
in
june
rather
than
in
december
for
fear
shale
boomers
will
well
boom
undermining
their
market
worries
had
a
solid
basis
drilling
in
the
united
states
is
indeed
booming
and
now
canadian
drillers
are
also
moving
south
to
respond
to
the
demand
for
new
wells
the
will
hit
the
mark
very
soon
last
week
the
daily
average
stood
at
over
million
bpd
but
opec
s
hands
are
pretty
much
tied
because
any
suggestion
of
a
premature
end
to
the
cut
deal
immediately
hits
prices
and
while
this
would
hurt
both
opec
and
drillers
it
would
hurt
opec
opec
is
stuck
with
the
deal
raw
as
it
may
be
especially
as
members
such
as
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
plan
hefty
oil
investment
programs
for
the
medium
term
these
programs
require
oil
prices
to
remain
higher
to
which
end
opec
will
need
to
continue
pumping
less
as
the
pumps
more
of
course
there
is
a
good
chance
that
opec
and
russia
will
devise
a
gradual
exit
strategy
that
will
see
the
deal
end
when
it
is
supposed
to
there
s
also
a
good
chance
that
it
will
be
extended
again
because
it
s
working
