the oil powerhouses replacing opec
three
countries
currently
account
for
close
to
percent
of
global
crude
oil
production
and
only
one
of
these
countries
is
a
member
of
the
organization
of
petroleum
exporting
countries
the
three
are
russia
the
united
states
and
saudi
arabia
and
as
their
clout
over
oil
markets
increases
with
rising
production
rates
opec
s
is
set
to
decline
at
least
john
kemp
noted
in
a
recent
column
on
the
topic
that
the
troika
now
called
the
shots
more
than
ever
before
all
three
countries
produced
north
of
million
bpd
a
day
in
october
a
record
high
and
more
than
the
combined
production
of
the
rest
of
opec
and
according
to
opec
this
state
of
affairs
will
continue
to
develop
in
a
direction
unfavorable
for
opec
with
the
troika
s
combined
production
rising
to
over
percent
of
the
global
total
this
year
while
opec
s
share
falls
below
of
the
three
producers
has
its
own
oil
production
policy
that
is
relatively
independent
of
other
producers
true
saudi
arabia
and
russia
have
been
playing
on
the
same
team
for
the
last
two
years
to
a
large
extent
because
the
game
strategy
has
been
mutually
beneficial
yet
we
have
seen
abundant
indications
that
the
moment
the
interests
of
the
two
begin
to
diverge
each
is
likely
to
drop
the
team
game
and
pursue
its
own
priorities
the
in
the
meantime
has
become
the
single
largest
swing
factor
outside
the
club
with
relentlessly
rising
production
that
could
push
it
to
the
top
spot
globally
next
production
will
only
continue
to
rise
if
opec
now
decides
to
start
cutting
production
once
again
in
order
to
push
prices
higher
further
strengthening
the
importance
on
the
global
oil
market
so
does
this
all
mean
opec
is
as
good
as
dead
for
the
time
being
mostly
yes
most
of
its
members
as
kemp
notes
fall
in
one
or
more
of
the
following
categories
is
struggling
under
sanctions
mismanagement
and
unrest
is
too
small
to
matter
is
maximizing
production
rather
than
participating
in
output
controls
or
simply
aligns
its
output
policies
with
those
of
saudi
related
oil
puts
shale
to
the
testthe
future
remains
uncertain
however
most
respectable
forecasters
such
as
the
energy
information
administration
and
the
international
energy
agency
are
upbeat
about
the
growth
of
oil
demand
but
the
upbeat
forecasts
come
with
conditions
the
iea
most
recently
said
in
its
world
energy
outlook
that
producers
will
need
to
up
investments
in
new
conventional
production
substantially
to
be
ale
to
respond
to
this
demand
failing
that
the
would
have
to
increase
its
shale
oil
production
by
as
much
as
million
bpd
in
the
seven
years
to
which
is
a
bold
target
to
say
the
members
are
obvious
candidates
for
some
of
this
production
growth
despite
a
lot
of
worry
around
the
cartel
s
spare
capacity
earlier
this
year
when
it
became
clear
the
cuts
need
to
be
reversed
to
rein
in
prices
some
of
the
members
such
as
iraq
and
libya
are
on
track
to
grow
their
production
true
this
growth
will
likely
be
nowhere
near
the
more
than
a
million
bpd
that
producers
have
added
in
the
past
year
but
it
could
be
substantial
in
the
case
of
iraq
if
the
political
and
price
conditions
allow
s
more
venezuela
and
iran
are
unlikely
to
spend
the
rest
of
eternity
under
sanctions
there
is
a
possibility
however
remote
at
the
moment
that
these
two
could
at
some
point
reverse
the
decline
in
production
they
are
experiencing
now
iran
has
already
demonstrated
it
could
ramp
up
pretty
quickly
if
given
the
chance
in
other
words
opec
s
clout
on
oil
markets
may
be
waning
but
it
might
be
too
early
to
bury
the
cartel
for
good
