three reasons why lng prices in asia are plunging
prices
for
liquefied
natural
gas
lng
remain
weak
going
into
what
forecasters
are
claiming
will
be
a
warmer
than
usual
winter
season
in
the
northern
hemisphere
in
fact
last
week
spot
prices
for
the
fuel
in
asian
tumbled
some
percent
hitting
three
month
lows
an
uncharacteristic
development
for
this
time
of
year
reuters
citing
traders
said
that
lng
spot
prices
for
january
delivery
in
north
asia
were
estimated
at
per
million
british
thermal
units
mmbtu
cents
lower
than
last
continuing
to
put
downward
pressure
on
prices
include
warmer
temperatures
lng
storage
levels
in
the
world
s
top
three
lng
importers
japan
china
and
south
korea
remaining
high
and
plunging
brent
oil
prices
which
long
term
lng
contracts
are
mostly
linked
to
though
spot
purchases
are
not
usually
linked
to
oil
prices
they
often
follow
either
oil
prices
upward
or
downward
trajectory
a
trader
said
that
the
big
question
mark
right
now
is
how
the
weather
will
pan
out
as
the
market
will
quickly
turn
once
it
starts
to
get
cold
but
until
then
it
s
inventory
levels
right
now
in
many
lng
doldrumsjapan
weather
bureau
earlier
this
month
said
the
el
niño
weather
pattern
appears
to
have
formed
and
that
there
was
a
percent
chance
it
would
continue
into
the
northern
hemisphere
for
spring
meanwhile
a
government
forecast
predicted
a
percent
chance
of
el
nino
lasting
in
the
northern
hemisphere
unto
spring
el
niño
is
a
climate
cycle
in
the
pacific
ocean
that
occurs
every
five
years
or
more
which
has
a
global
impact
on
weather
patterns
the
cycle
begins
when
warm
water
in
the
western
tropical
pacific
ocean
shifts
eastward
along
the
equator
toward
the
coast
of
south
oil
prices
are
also
putting
downward
pressure
on
lng
prices
as
oil
prices
have
pivoted
in
just
a
little
more
than
a
month
after
hitting
the
mid
per
barrel
price
point
for
global
benchmark
brent
crude
and
the
mid
price
point
for
benchmark
west
texas
intermediate
crude
wti
crude
are
now
percent
off
recent
highs
amid
concerns
of
a
growing
supply
glut
widening
from
record
oil
output
in
the
russia
and
saudi
arabia
and
after
washington
issued
sanctions
waivers
to
several
countries
for
their
iranian
oil
imports
related
goldman
oil
prices
set
for
rebound
in
extra
supply
comes
as
demand
growth
is
projected
to
dampen
amid
economic
downturn
from
the
ongoing
trade
war
between
washington
and
beijing
and
continued
sluggish
economic
growth
in
emerging
economies
a
robust
dollar
is
also
eating
into
demand
for
oil
since
oil
is
traded
in
dollars
and
a
strong
greenback
adds
to
the
cost
of
oil
imports
hitting
particularly
hard
countries
like
india
the
philippines
indonesia
and
others
however
weaker
oil
prices
over
the
last
month
has
offered
some
respite
for
oil
import
dependent
third
reason
that
lng
spot
prices
in
asia
are
tumbling
is
that
storage
levels
as
already
mentioned
are
full
particularly
in
china
as
energy
planners
in
beijing
try
to
avert
a
repeat
of
last
year
s
fiasco
when
the
government
sought
to
replace
coal
with
cleaner
burning
natural
gas
during
the
winter
too
quickly
resulting
in
a
shortage
of
natural
gas
and
the
diversion
of
the
cleaner
burning
fuel
from
industrial
end
users
to
residential
far
back
as
august
china
began
filling
underground
gas
storage
tanks
including
state

giant

of
the
