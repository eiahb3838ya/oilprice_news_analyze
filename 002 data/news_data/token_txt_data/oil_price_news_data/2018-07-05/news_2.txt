aramco looks to launch new oil price benchmark
saudi
arabia
has
turned
its
oil
market
fortunes
around
over
the
past
years
from
facing
potential
financial
collapse
due
to
a
historic
supply
overhang
of
crude
on
the
back
of
shale
oil
production
and
riyadh
s
late
decision
to
turn
on
the
oil
production
spigot
to
flood
markets
retain
market
share
and
drive
prices
to
the
ground
to
force
mostly
producers
out
of
business
the
opec
de
facto
leader
cleverly
formed
a
new
partnership
with
russia
to
get
its
oil
market
swagger
essence
what
the
saudis
and
a
collective
opec
for
that
part
could
not
do
it
overwhelmingly
achieved
with
russian
and
help
oecd
oil
inventory
levels
dipped
to
five
year
averages
recently
oil
prices
have
reached
highs
and
the
saudis
are
back
where
they
are
most
comfortable
seemingly
in
the
business
of
calling
the
shots
in
global
oil
markets
even
promoting
president
trump
to
use
twitter
to
appeal
to
the
saudi
oil
production
apparatus
to
curb
rising
oil
prices
a
development
that
as
recently
as
a
year
ago
most
market
observers
thought
would
never
happen
again
given
the
surge
in
us
oil
of
this
posturing
and
hasn
t
been
lost
in
asia
particularly
in
china
the
world
s
largest
energy
consumer
and
largest
crude
oil
importer
there
have
been
stark
disagreements
recently
between
saudi
arabia
and
chinese

of

apparently
exasperated
at
saudi
price
increases
said
that
it
would
reduce
saudi
oil
import
loading
in

by
percent
due
to
saudi
aramco
increasing
the
price
of
its
flagship
arab
light
crude
sold
to

a

after

the

in
the

of
its

over
the

saudi
aramco
is
changing
the
formula
it
uses
to
price
its

to

in
a
move
that
analysts
say
is
aimed
at
improving
the
overall
reliability
of
its
saudi
oil
giant
said
on
wednesday
that
the
move
represents
the
first
change
to
benchmarks
for

the
inclusion

that
the
idea
behind
the

was
to

saudi
aramco
s
new

benchmark
could
also
not
only
signify
a
good
will
gesture
to
its
asian
oil
buyers
particularly
china
but
it
will
also

regain

will

that
