can north sea oil stay profitable?
the
uk
continental
shelf
in
the
north
sea
has
recently
drawn
attention
with
several
significant
asset
sale
deals
that
have
seen
chevron
reduce
its
exposure
to
the
legacy
production
area
and
small
independents
gain
more
ground
now
an
academic
study
has
estimated
there
may
be
between
and
billion
barrels
of
oil
equivalent
still
to
be
pumped
from
the
north
sea
over
the
next
three
decades
although
overall
production
is
set
for
a
steady
and
alexander
kemp
and
dr
linda
stephen
from
the
university
of
aberdeen
on
request
from
the
oil
and
gas
authority
recently
completed
a
study
involving
economic
modeling
based
on
two
scenarios
featuring
crude
oil
prices
at
us
and
us
a
barrel
the
favorable
effect
of
lower
production
costs
in
the
area
the
authors
of
the
study
report
the
development
of
these
resources
would
cost
a
few
hundred
billion
dollars
assuming
the
current
tax
regime
remains
in
place
incentivizing
producers
to
drill
for
more
oil
and
gas
and
also
assuming
platform
decommissioning
costs
of
over
us
billion
billion
pounds
in
the
period
to
resources
of
billion
barrels
of
oil
and
gas
sound
like
pretty
good
let
s
not
forget
the
price
and
tax
the
authors
also
report
production
will
decline
steadily
the
number
of
new
wells
drilled
annually
in
a
medium
effort
scenario
is
set
to
fall
from
in
to
in
and
in
in
a
low
effort
scenario
the
number
of
new
wells
drilled
would
decline
from
in
to
in
and
in
s
worth
noting
that
this
decline
will
occur
despite
improving
technological
capabilities
that
are
boosting
recovery
rates
while
lowering
costs
further
there
is
hardly
a
chance
for
anyone
exploring
the
north
sea
to
stumble
upon
an
elephant
now
indeed
the
authors
of
the
study
note
the
current
exploration
environment
is
dominated
by
small
undeveloped
discoveries
that
can
not
generate
substantial
net
present
value
whatever
the
investment
made
related
why
big
oil
loves

intelligenceeven
so
investment
in
the
north
sea
is
rising
the
financial
times
reported
earlier
this
week
investments
in
new
oil
and
gas
developments
the
area
had
reached
us
billion
billion
pounds
since
the
start
of
the

since
this
compares
with

challenges
remain
as
oilprice
reported
earlier
this
month
there
has
been
something
of
an
exodus
of
japanese
companies
from
the
uk
north
sea
while
these
companies
have
been
replaced
by
small
private
independent
energy
firms
it
remains
unclear
whether
this
replacement
could
ensure
sustainable
development
of
the
area
s
yet
untapped
resources
over
the
long
recent
approval
by
the
oil
and
gas
authority
of
a
joint
project
of
bp
and
shell
is
certainly
big
news
in
this
respect
after
most
supermajors
including
these
two
shrank
their
presence
in
the
north
sea
but
chances
are
such
announcements
would
be
few
and
far
between
in
the
long
run
after
all
there
is
only
so
much
lower
than
production
costs
could
fall
and
the
future
of
prices
is
highly
uncertain
