uncertainty rises on saudi oil minister's comment
global
crude
oil
supply
might
need
some
cuts
saudi
arabia
s
energy
minister
khalid
told
state
tv
channel
as
quoted
by
reuters
to
offset
recent
increases
we
have
entered
the
stage
of
worrying
about
this
increase
the
official
said
adding
any
reduction
in
supply
would
go
towards
ensuring
the
stability
accomplished
as
a
result
of
the
pact
sealed
at
the
end
of
minister
s
remarks
are
somewhat
surprising
as
they
come
amid
worry
about
loss
of
supply
from
iran
once
sanctions
enter
into
effect
next
month
however
there
has
also
been
new
concern
among
market
players
that
global
economic
growth
may
be
slowing
down
and
will
continue
to
slow
down
ultimately
hurting
oil
makes
the
comments
confusing
however
is
the
fact
they
come
on
the
heels
of
earlier
statements
by
falih
that
saudi
arabia
is
ready
to
increase
production
to
up
to
million
bpd
and
also
invest
in
boosting
its
spare
i
don
t
rule
out
that
the
kingdom
s
production
which
has
been
million
barrels
per
day
over
the
last
decade
or
so
will
be
a
million
to
two
millions
barrels
higher
the
energy
minister
told
the
saudi
gazette
just
this
the
same
report
falih
was
quoted
as
saying
global
oil
demand
would
grow
from
million
bpd
to
million
bpd
over
the
next
this
month
falih
had
said
saudi
arabia
will
continue
boosting
its
production
of
crude
oil
in
november
as
well
after
two
months
of
increases
with
the
october
daily
rate
estimated
at
million
bpd
he
also
made
sure
the
message
is
clear
given
the
disruptions
that
have
taken
place
oil
would
be
easily
in
the
range
had
it
not
been
for
the
extra
efforts
the
kingdom
had
done

said
