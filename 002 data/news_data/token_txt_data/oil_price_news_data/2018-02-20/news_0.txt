frac sand shortage threatens shale boom
higher
drilling
costs
could
threaten
the
recent
surge
in
united
states
shale
production
halliburton
said
last
week
that
its
earnings
could
be
negatively
impacted
because
of
bottlenecks
related
to
the
supply
of
frac
sand
used
in
shale
drilling
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
halliburton
s
shares
were
briefly
halted
on
february
after
halliburton
s
cfo
chris
weber
told
an
audience
at
the
credit
suisse
energy
summit
that
the
company
s
first
quarter
earnings
could
take
a
hit
by
a
whopping
cents
per
reason
he
said
was
because
of
delays
by
canadian
rail
companies
that
would
slow
the
delivery
of
frac
sand
halliburton
saw
its
shares
drop
by
more
than
percent
on
a
day
that
saw

p
sand
is
integral
to
growing
shale
production
increasingly
so
these
days
with
more
and
more
sand
pumped
down
into
a
well
shale
drillers
have
credited
the
heavy
doses
of
sand
with
squeezing
out
more
oil
and
gas
from
the
average
well
demand
for
frac
sand
surged
from
million
tons
in
to
million
tons
in
consumption
fell
in
the
ensuing
years
as
drilling
dried
up
when
oil
prices
collapsed
but
frac
sand
consumption
surpassed
previous
highs
in
as
drilling
resoundingly
came
back
related
oil
prices
diverge
on
mixed
datain
frac
sand
demand
is
expected
to
top
million
tons
according
to
rystad
energy
right
now
the
market
is
really
stretched
thin
says
thomas
jacob
a
senior
analyst
at
ihs
markit
told
the
ft
in
december
everyone
is
running
at
full
much
of
the
frac
sand
has
come
from
places
like
wisconsin
which
produces
northern
white
sand
that
is
hard
and
round
helping
to
create
porous
fractures
in
shale
wells
it
is
high
quality
but
expensive
particularly
because
it
has
to
be
shipped
by
rail
to
texas
shale
fields
the
ft
reported
that
frac
sand
could
cost
per
short
ton
on
at
the
texas

in
essentially
triple
what
it
costs
at
the

in
the
northern

to
new
investment
in
frac
sand
mining
in
texas
where
brown
sand
could
be
produced
the
quality
was
not
as
good
with
finer
grains
but
texas
brown
sand
could
cost
a
third
less
than
its
northern
cousin
and
it
is
located
much
closer
to
drilling
as
the
mines
in
texas
are
still
in
the
process
of
coming
online
the
shale
industry
s
dependence
on
far
away
suppliers
continues
and
because
drilling
is
ramping
up
and
the
average
shale
driller
is
using
more
proppant
than
ever
before
sand
supplies
are
feeling

during
the
fourth
quarter
we
also
saw
cost
inflation
in
sand
and

the
price
of
sand
escalated

few
months

president
and

told
investors
on
an
earnings
call
in
january
b
ut
i
believe
that
increasing
sand
capacity
particularly
from
localized
mines
combined
with
our
supply
chain
strategy
will
reduce
the
cost
throughout
he
went
on
to
try
to
reassure
investors
now
these
headwinds
were
anticipated
are
transitory
and
are
not
a
surprise
at
this
point
in
the

could

startup
close
to
the

in

we
using
local

with
a
few
customers
in
the
permian
and
i
believe
this
will
become
an
increasing
trend
as
additional
capacity
is
activated
therefore
sand
cost
should
go
down
in
as
regional
sand
mines
come
on
line
and
capacity
is
increased
halliburton
s
ceo
jeff
miller
said
last
month
this
will
not
happen
overnight
but
we
are
working
with
our
customers
and
suppliers
to
ensure
that
we
can
provide
desired
profit
at
a
reasonable
in
the
meantime
drilling
operations
could
face
some
obstacles
the

warned
in
a

that
customer
frustration
is
rampant
given
the

to
production

likely
see
similar

weatherit
will
be
a
while
before
the

on

if
any
becomes
clear
