just how low can iran’s oil exports go?
iran
s
oil
exports
started
to
fall
noticeably
in
august
as
key
customers
in
asia
began
to
curtail
oil
purchases
to
either
comply
with
the
efforts
to
bring
iranian
exports
to
zero
or
to
win
waivers
with
the
s
crude
oil
and
condensate
sales
fell
in
august
to
below
million
lowest
level
in
more
than
a
year
according
to
tanker
tracking
data
compiled
by
september
the
trend
of
reduced
iranian
oil
exports
has
continued
and
analysts
expect
further
cuts
from
some
of
iran
s
oil
forward
there
are
two
major
factors
for
estimating
how
low
iranian
oil
exports
could
sink
one
is
how
much
of
iran
s
oil
china
india
and
europe
will
buy
in
october
and
then
in
november
when
the
sanctions
kick
in
the
other
is
the
concern
that
tanker
tracking
data
may
become
less
reliable
as
iran
may
try
to
use
some
unconventional
methods
of
keeping
its
oil
sales
on
track
like
switching
off
tracking
devices
on
solution
that
tehran
is
said
to
have
used
in
the
previous
round
of
sanctions
in
september
and
however
iran
s
crude
oil
and
condensate
exports
surprisingly
increased
by
around
bpd
compared
to
the
august
period
preliminary
trade
flow
data
by
s
p
global
platts
showed
this
s
crude

condensate
exports
averaged
million
bpd
in
the
first
half
of
september
up
from
million
bpd
for
the
august
if
the
trend
this
month
continues
iran
s
oil
exports
would
still
be
around
bpd
lower
than
in
august
when
exports
had
averaged
million
bpd
down
from

in

according

first
two
weeks
of
