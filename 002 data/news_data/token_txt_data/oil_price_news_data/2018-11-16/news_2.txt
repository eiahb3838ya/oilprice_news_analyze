saudi
arabia
has
been
slashing
oil
exports
to
the
united
states
over
the
past
two
months
in
what
looks
like
a
move
to
force
a
reduction
in
the
world
s
most
transparently
reported
inventories
that
could
put
the
saudis
on
a
collision
course
with
president
donald
trump
who
has
repeatedly
said
that
oil
prices
should
be
much
saudis
started
to
reduce
shipments
to
the
united
states
in

en
route
to
the

down
from
more
than

saudi
tactic
to
send
reduced
volumes
to
the
regularly

week
crude
oil
last
year
reduced
saudi
oil
imports
tend
to
reflect
in
lower
weekly
inventories
while
in
the
past
weeks
crude
builds
have
been
weighing
on
oil
prices
together
with
fears
of
an
oversupplied
global
market
and
signs
of
slowing
economic
and
oil
demand
it
worked
so
well
in
for
the
saudis
to
cut
flows
to
the
because
people
could
see
the
inventories
dropping
because
data
is
so
timely
and
transparent
