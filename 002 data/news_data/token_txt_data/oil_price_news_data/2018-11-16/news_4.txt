will the ‘next permian’ ever be developed?
the
vaca
muerta
shale
basin
in
argentina
is
the
only
unconventional
play
outside
of
north
america
where
activity
has
already
made
the
transition
from
exploration
to
development
the
potential
prize
is
huge
geographically
the
vaca
muerta
shale
is
three
times
the
size
of
the
highly
prolific
permian
basin
in
the
us
and
it
could
turn
out
to
be
the
next
permian
if
the
right
conditions
are
established
but
much
remains
to
be
done
before
that
energy
s
shale
intel
group
in
collaboration
with
luxmath
consulting
has
released
a
comprehensive
new
report
covering
all
aspects
of
the
vaca
muerta
shale
including
development
status
production
forecasts
drilling
and
completion
projections
and
the
outlook
for
the
various
service
segments
in
the
industry

there
are
several
major
bottlenecks
that
are
currently
affecting
vaca
muerta
proppant
infrastructure
labor
pressure
pumping
and
the
macro
economic
situation
in
argentina
in
addition
investments
need
to
be
made
in
water
transportation
infrastructure
as
drilling
and
completions
increase
within
the
region
says
ryan

senior
vice
president
of

at
rystad
muerta
should
see
the
tally
of
fracked
wells
reach
between
and
this
year
only
three
of
those
wells
are
vertical
while
all
other
wells
are
horizontal
completions
it
is
expected
that
fracking
activity
will
grow
at
a
rate
of
per
year
from
through
reaching
about
wells
in
according
to
rystad
energy
research
this
heightened
activity
will
generate
a
significant
boost
in
vaca
muerta
oil
production
from
about
bpd
in
the
third
quarter
of
to
between
and
bpd
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
most
of
this
growth
will
come
from

we

further
optimization
of

will
surely
lead
to
additional

shale
basins
in

are
six
active
service
companies
currently
providing
pressure
pumping
services
in
vaca
muerta
collectively
supplying
about
horsepower
for
hydraulic

operations
thus
far
however
most
of
these
service
providers
have
struggled
to
achieve
acceptable
margins
in
argentina
improving
the
return
on
investment
for
key
service
providers
will
be
a
vital
issue
to
be
addressed
by
operators
in

to

their
goal

frac
sand
demand
will
increase
faster
than
the
well
count
as
operators
migrate
towards
longer
laterals
and
increased
proppant
intensity
on
the
supply
side
proppant
is
in
fact
the
biggest
immediate
bottleneck
in
vaca
muerta
as
trucking
distances
are
upwards
of
km
at
times
we
expect
some
brownfield
mine
expansions
along
with
investments
into

this
will
bring
total
sand
supply
from

to
million
