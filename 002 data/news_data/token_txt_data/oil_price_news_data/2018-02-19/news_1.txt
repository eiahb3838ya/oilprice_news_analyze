canadaâ€™s oil crisis continues to worsen
canadian
oil
producers
can
t
get
a
break
first
it
was
the
pipelines
there
are
not
enough
of
them
to
carry
the
crude
from
alberta
s
oil
sands
to
export
markets
this
pipeline
capacity
problem
has
been
forcing
producers
to
pay
higher
rates
for
railway
transportation
which
has
naturally
hurt
their
margins
in
no
small
way
now
there
is
a
shortage
of
rail
cars
as
situation
is
going
from
bad
to
worse
for
canadian
producers
who
can
t
seem
to
catch
a
break
canadian
railway
operators
are
fighting
harsh
winter
weather
and
finding
it
hard
to
supply
enough
cars
to
move
both
crude
oil
from
alberta
and
grain
from
the
harsh
weather
is
just
the
latest
factor
however
before
that
there
was
the
surge
in
demand
for
rail
cars
from
the
oil
industry
bloomberg
reports
citing
canadian
national
railway
the
surge
happened
in
the
third
quarter
of
last
year
and
canadian
national
s
chief
executive
ghislain
houle
says
that
it
took
the
company
a
little
bit
by
this
surprise
has
led
to
pinch
points
on
the
railway
operator
s
network
further
aggravating
an
already
bad
a
result
crude
oil
remains
in
alberta
and
prices
fall
further
because
alberta
is
where
the
local
crude
is
priced
bloomberg
s
jen
skerritt
and
robert
tuttle
note
in
fact
canadian
crude
is
currently
trading
at
the
biggest
discount
to
west
texas
intermediate
in
four
years
at
per
barrel
the
blow
is
particularly
severe
as
it
comes
amid
improving
oil
prices
elsewhere
driven
by
the
stock
market
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
is
barely
a
glimmer
despite
federal
government
support
for
the
trans
mountain
pipeline
expansion
project
it
is
still
facing
obstacles
that
may
result
in
it
never
seeing
the
light
of
day
the
project
that
would
boost
the
current
pipeline
s
capacity
from
bpd
to
bpd
accommodating
much
of
the
increased
alberta
bitumen
production
is
being
challenged
in
court
and
kinder
morgan
has
yet
to
collect
even
half
of
the
necessary
permits
to
proceed
with
it
there
are
no
other
major
pipeline
projects
in
canada
that
have
been
approved
related
the
world
s
most
gridlocked
citiesmeanwhile
the
news
from
the
research
front
is
not
good
either
back
in
september
media
outlets
reported
on
an
accidental
discovery
that
could
make
transporting
bitumen
by
rail
much
safer
by
turning
the
crude
into
pellets
this
would
minimize
the
danger
of
a
spill
but
some
said
at
the
time
would
increase
transportation
national
railway
is
also
working
on
its
own
bitumen
pellet
technology
it
calls
canapux
but
for
now
it
has
not
yet
been
commercialized
perhaps
for
the
same
reason
of
cost
yet
bitumen
pellets
some
observers
note
could
be
the
best
solution
to
the
current
conflict
between
alberta
and
british
columbia
the
latter
is
doing
everything
it
can
to
stall
trans
mountain
s
expansion
citing
environmental
concerns
alberta
stopped
importing
wines
in
bitumen
pellets
are
safe
their
creators
say
so
would
have
nothing
to
worry
about
and
yet
like
grain
these
pellets
would
need
rail
cars
to
transport
them
should
this
option
be
chosen
despite
cost
considerations
canadian
national
says
it
plans
to
hike
its
capex
to
billion
this
year
in
response
to
the
shortage
the
effect
of
the
surprise
jump
in
demand
for
railcar
capacity
from
the
oil
industry
should
also
subside
eventually
the
only
question
is
how
much
all
these
factors
would
hurt
canada
s
oil
production
