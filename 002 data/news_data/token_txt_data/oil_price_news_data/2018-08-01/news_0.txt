the next trade war escalation will hit u.s. oil
the
trump
administration
is
considering
another
ramp
up
of
the
trade
war
with
china
a
move
that
could
begin
to
rattle
the
global
wall
street
journal
reports
that
the
trump
administration
is
considering
ratcheting
up
the
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
from
the
proposed
percent
levy
to
as
much
as
percent
hiking
the
tariff
trump
s
advisers
seem
to
think
will
force
beijing
to
back
down
and
offer
major
concessions
whether
or
not
those
tariffs
move
forward
remains
to
be
seen
and
the
administration
reportedly
won
t
make
a
decision
until
later
this
tariffs
are
justified
the
trump
administration
says
because
the
chinese
yuan
continues
to
depreciate
undercutting
competitiveness
once
you
go
down
the
road
of
using
tariffs
to
disrupt
the
chinese
you
have
to
say

a
china
expert
at
the
american
enterprise
institute
and
adviser
to
the
administration
on
trade
told
the
problem
with
that
logic
is
that
the
tariffs
are
part
of
the
reason
why
china
s
currency
is
under
pressure
to
be
sure
china
s
economy
is
showing
other
signs
of
trouble
from
slowing
growth
to
a
rise
in
corporate
defaults
but
the
yuan
which
is
fixed
against
the
dollar
recently
ran
into
rocky
waters
at
least
in
part
driven
by
fears
of
the
trade
the
rate
tightening
by
the
federal
reserve
is
also
putting
pressure

stanley
estimates
gdp
would
lose
a
percentage
point
if
the
trump
administration
imposed
a
percent
tariff
on
all
imports
from
china
and
europe
while
china
would
lose
percentage
points
growth
overall
is
still
there
and
while
there
are
risks
it
s
holding
up
the
big
picture
of
a
trade
war
and
protectionism
is
that
it
is
a
slow
death
a
death
by
a
thousand
paper
cuts
instead
of
anything
sudden
and
shocking

said
on

that
it

if

the

war
escalates
there
is
a
good
chance
that
china
retaliates
by
slapping
a
tariff
on
crude
oil
imports
from
the
perspective
china
is
a
significant
market
but
shipments
are
just
of
chinese
imports

senior
manager
at

told
the
wsj
there
s
more
of
the
losing
out
here
than
china
has
emerged
as
the
largest
buyer
of
crude
but
that
would
quickly
change
with
a
doesn
t
mean
that
crude
exports
would
be
shut
in
far
from
it
some
analysts
argue
it
wouldn
t
even
make
much
of
a
difference
in
terms
of
total
demand
exporters
could
simply
reroute
shipments
elsewhere
and
because
china
would
have
to
make
up
for
lost
imports
it
would
be
buying
from
elsewhere
as
well
so
oil
flows
would
be
reshuffled
rather
than
significantly
interrupted
still
exporters
might
have
to
offer
discounts
to
other
buyers
if
they
lose
the
chinese
broadly
however
the
effect
of
tariffs
on
consumer
demand
could
be
significant
the
initial
billion
has
only
been
lightly
felt
in
the
but
moving
forward
with
tariffs
on
billion
of
chinese
imports
would
mean
higher
prices
for
a
long
list
of
consumer
goods
acting
as
a
drag
on
household
income
ultimately
that
could
begin
to
cut

gasoline
consumption
more
expensive
consumer
goods
comes
hot
on
the
heels
of
the
sharp
increase
in
retail
gasoline
prices
this
year
according
to
the
eia
gasoline
demand
dipped
by
bpd
in
may
industrial
activity
would
also
slow
down
further
cutting
into
demand

that
could
reverberate
around
the
world
china
s
economy
would
likely
slow
substantially
with
knock
on
effects
elsewhere
it
is
hard
to
put
solid
figures
on
the
downside
risk
especially
with
so
much
still
up
in
the
while
the
likelihood
that
creeping
us
protectionism
spins
out
into
a
broader
trade
war
has
unfortunately
moved
from
tail
risk
to
plausible
scenario
we
believe
that
cooler
heads
will
ultimately
prevail

unfortunately
whether
