venezuelaâ€™s oil meltdown defies belief
venezuela
might
have
to
declare
force
majeure
on
its
oil
exports
as
production
plunges
and
its
ports
are
unable
to
ship
enough
crude
the
ongoing
meltdown
in
venezuela
s
oil
sector
could
tighten
the
oil
market
more
than
reported
tuesday
that
venezuela
is
considering
declaring
force
majeure
a
legal
declaration
made
in
extraordinary
circumstances
to
basically
get
out
of
contractual
obligations
in
other
words
venezuela
s
pdvsa
is
essentially
prepared
to
say
that
it
can
t
supply
the
oil
that
it
utter
collapse
of
the
country
s
oil
production
is
obviously
a
big
factor
in
pdvsa
s
inability
to
ship
enough
oil
output
is
down
below
million
barrels
per
day
and
falling
the
tanker
traffic
at
a
handful
of
its
ports
has
created
unexpected
bottlenecks
which
have
slowed
loadings
clogged
ports
are
the
direct
result
of
the
seizure
of
operations
on
several
caribbean
islands
by
conocophillips
last
month
the
american
oil
major
sought
to
enforce
an
arbitration
award
laying
claim
to
a
series
of
storage
facilities
on
the
islands
of
bonaire
curacao
and
assets
were
crucial
to
pdvsa
s
operations
in
fact
they
had
become
even
more
important
as
pdvsa
s
facilities
in
venezuela
deteriorated
they
had
the
ability
to
service
very
large
crude
carriers
vlccs
and
were
important
for
storing
and
blending
pdvsa
s
oil
and
preparing
it
for
conocophillips
tried
to
take
over
those
facilities
pdvsa
has
tried
to
shift
operations
back
to
its
ports
in
venezuela
but
those
terminals
are
in
very
bad
shape
and
can
not
make
up
for
the
loss
of
the
caribbean
facilities
reuters
reported
that
there
are
more
than
tankers
sitting
off
the
venezuelan
coast
related
will
saudi
arabia
listen
to
demands
for
more
oil
reuters
also
says
that
pdvsa
told
customers
that
they
need
to
send
ships
that
are
able
to
handle
loadings
since
they
can
t
service
enough
ships
at
the
ports
if
customers
fail
to
do
that
or
fail
to
accept
those
terms
pdvsa
could
declare
force
majeure
reuters
says
most
customers
are
balking
at
the
demand
since
there
is
no
third
party
supervision
plus
the
added
cost
of
transfers
is
also
something
customers
are
not
willing
to
take
is
no
surprise
that
venezuela
has
fallen
short
on
the
shipments
it
has
promised
but
the
figures
are
staggering
in
april
venezuela
only
shipped
million
barrels
per
day
of
oil
and
fuels
or
bpd
below
what
it
had
contracted
according
to
reuters
that
means
that
some
customers
are
missing
out
on
cargo
for
instance
in
april
pdvsa
shorted
its
subsidiary
citgo
nearly
all
of
what
it
had
promised
problems
for
venezuela
continue
to
mount
and
the
news
that
it
is
considering
force
majeure
points
to
a
more
catastrophic
decline
in
production
and
exports
pdvsa
in
the
best
case
only
has
about
of
crude
supply
available
for
export
in
june
a
marketing
division
executive
within
the
company
told
argus
seems
unlikely
that
the
sudden
decline
in
exports
will
be
resolved
in
any
reasonable
timeframe
it
isn
t
just
a
matter
of
easing
bottlenecks
at
the
ports
for
one
it
isn
t
clear
that
pdvsa
can
handle
the
necessary
volumes
from
its
existing
export
importantly
upstream
oil
production
continues
to
plummet
and
refining
and
processing
are
also
in
freefall
venezuela
s
heavy
oil
needs
to
be
upgraded
before
it
can
be
exported
but
at
least
three
pdvsa
upgraders
are
in
terrible
shape
and
the
petropiar
upgrader
which
pdvsa
runs
jointly
with
chevron
is
offline
for
maintenance
that
is
also
the
site
overseen
by
chevron
employees
that
were
detained
by
venezuelan
security
services
a
few
months
ago
putting
a
chill
on
pdvsa
has
a
critical
structural
problem
that
can
not
be
fixed
in
a
few
weeks
or
even
a
few
months
because
the
core
problem
is
that
venezuela
crude
production
has
dropped
far
beneath
the
volumes
we
are
contracted
to
deliver
a
company
executive
told
argus
we
simply
are
producing
enough
crude
and
we
do
have
the
cash
flow
to
compensate
by
purchasing
crude
from
third
parties
to
meet
our
supply
commitments
our
greatest
operational
concern
right
now
is
that
production
continues
to
fall
and
our
export
supply
volumes
also
will
continue
to
decline
as
a
as
a
result
the
force
majeure
on
shipments
seems
unavoidable
unless
that
is
customers
simply
take
a
haircut
and
accept
lower
volumes
a
pdvsa
source
told
argus
media
that
companies
that
don
t
accept
lower
volumes
could
see
all
of
their
shipments
suspended
that
sounds
like
a
threat
but
it
is
pdvsa
that
is
in
the
state
of
crisis
not
buyers
from
china
india
or
the
related

kingdom

are

reporting
problems
with
shipments
a
japanese
trading
house
told
s
p
global
platts
this
week
that
it
has
been
unable
to
load
up
on
venezuelan
oil
under
a
deal
there
is
no
cargo
made
available
to
lift
said
the
diplomats
from
china
and
india
told
argus
that
refiners
from
their
countries
are
looking
elsewhere
for
oil
shipments
in
the
months
ahead
on
the
expectation
that
cargoes
from
venezuela
continue
to
decline
independent
refiners
from
china
are
looking
at
heavy
crude
sources
such
as
mexico
s
maya
colombia
s
castilla
and
canada
s
cold
lake
blend
according
to
s
p
global
could
cite
sanctions
as
a
justification
for
force
majeure
and
while
that
could
potentially
provide
some
legal
basis
for
nixing
shipments
from
the
oil
market
perspective
it
makes
no
difference
one
way
or
another
why
exports
are
declining
or
who
is
at
fault
all
that
matters
is
that
supply
is
falling
fast
and
to
the
extent
that
pdvsa
can
t
keep
up
with
its
obligations
it
is
a
worrying
sign
that
even
the
most
pessimistic
scenarios
for
venezuelan
output
could
turn
out
to
be
too
