a look inside the worldâ€™s hottest shale play
boomtownlast
week
my
day
job
took
me
to
the
permian
basin
a
colleague
and
i
arrived
late
at
night
at
our
hotel
in
fort
stockton
texas
the
hotel
parking
lot
was
full
the
vehicles
in
the
parking
lot
represented
every
type
of
business
the
front
desk
i
was
told
that
the
hotel
had
overbooked
us
so
we
had
to
search
for
new
accommodations
at
but
every
hotel
parking
lot
in
town
was
an
hour
of
searching
we
finally
located
a
pair
of
the
last
rooms
in
town
the
carpet
in
my
room
smelled
like
crude
oil
but
i
was
happy
to
have
a
bed
for
the
s
the
way
it
goes
in
the
permian
these
days
in
fact
i
heard
someone
say
that
if
you
can
t
make
money
in
the
permian
right
now
you
aren
t
century
of
productionafter
the
oil
price
crash
that
began
in
crude
oil
production
growth
in
the
stalled
in
annual
production
in
the
bakken
and
eagle
ford
formations
fell
by
percent
but
production
in
the
permian
basin
continued
to
the
permian
is
approaching
a
century
of
oil
production
at
present
production
has
reached
a
record
million
barrels
per
day

permian
basin
production
is
nearing
million
texas
side
of
the
permian
has
already
produced
billion
barrels
of
crude
and
trillion
cubic
feet
tcf
of
natural
gas
since
permian
basin
production
has
increased
by
nearly
million
bpd
which
is
a
larger
increase
than
any
other
oilfield
in
the
world
this
is
why
i
consider
the
permian
basin
to
be
the
world
s
hottest
oil
sand
menit
s
been
two
years
since
i
was
last
there
but
the
area
is
booming
as
never
before
in
addition
to
the
overbooked
hotels
the
restaurants
were
packed
and
the
highways
were
full
of
trucks
hauling
men
equipment
and
there
were
numerous
trucks
filled
with
sand
headed
to
hydraulic
fracturing
fracking
operations
here
is

snapped

a

a

primer
for
those
who
may
not
know
hydraulic
fracturing
fracking
involves
pumping
water
chemicals
and
a
proppant
down
an
oil
or
gas
well
under
high
pressure

oil
and
gas
do
not
travel
easily
through
some
formations
which
is
why
they
need
to
be
fractured
the
proppant
is
a
granular
material
designed
to
hold
those
channels
open
allowing
the
oil
or
natural
gas
to
flow
to
the
has
become
the
proppant
of
choice
for
most
frac
jobs
and
producers
have
figured
out
that
in
general
the
more
sand
they
use
the
more
oil

they
permian

a
cold

place

it
