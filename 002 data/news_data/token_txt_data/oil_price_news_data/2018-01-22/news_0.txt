will this cause an oil price reversal?
last
friday
oil
prices
surpassed
per
barrel
with
opec
s
decision
to
reduce
oil
production
oil
prices
continue
their
rise
while
iran
s
oil
minister
stated
in
early
january
that
opec
has
no
interest
in
prices
jumping
over
per
barrel
no
major
changes
have
yet
come
from
opec
and
market
players
continue
to
wonder
what
can
cause
the
price
rise
to
analysis
built
on
conventional
market
principles
sees
the
cause
of
this
tension
as
ongoing
conflict
in
the
middle
east
these
analysts
now
await
a
strong
reaction
from
russia
to
change
trends
however
as
the
international
energy
agency
iea
notes
the
explanation
may
be
more
oil
prices
surpassed
per
barrel
on
friday
much
international
analysis
narrows
the
cause
to
tensions
in
the
middle
east
or
more
precisely
iraq
s
decision
to
join
opec
s
agreement
to
rein
in
output
and
ongoing
conflict
jabbar
ali
hussein
iraq
s
oil
minister
announced
his
country
s
decision
to
join
opec
s
agreement
with
other
suppliers
to
rein
in
output
until
the
end
of
the
deal
should
continue
he
said
the
market
now
is
stabilizing
somehow
but
it
s
not
yet
despite
iranian
oil
minister
bijan
namdar
zanganeh
previously
stating
that
members
of
opec
are
not
keen
on
increased
brent
crude
prices
above
a
barrel
because
of
shale
oil
so
far
no
immediate
policy
shift
came
from
opec
on
friday
before
markets
closed
many
analysts
putting
the
middle
east
at
the
heart
of
the
cause
also
projected
that
tension
and
the
afrin
operation
might
push
prices
up
to
per
raising
questions
about
the
foundation
of
this
analysis
is
now
important
do
we
need
to
fear
if
so
who
or
what
can
stop
this
price
hike
answers
vary
upon
how
seriously
the
shale
revolution
is
taken
as
seen
in
two
expert
interviews
with
bloomberg
this
week
related
the
world
s
most
innovative
gas
fielded
morse
citigroup
s
global
head
of
commodities
research
told
bloomberg
he
doesn
t
know
how
opec
will
react
but
he
seemed
confident
regarding
russia
s
reaction
he
expects
russia
to
call
for
a
pause
in
the
agreement
during
opec
s
summer
meeting
as
rising
oil
prices
are
endangering
the
ruble
and
the
russian
central
bank
is
already
considering
an
the
iea
s
world
energy
outlook
projected
that
china
will
overtake
the
united
states
as
the
world
s
largest
oil
consumer
around
as
well
as
predicting
the
shale
revolution
will
turn
the
country
toward
export
making
the
a
net
oil
exporter
by
that
said
the
iea
estimates
prices
for
oil
will
remain
in
the
range
suggesting
that
even
if
the
does
become
an
energy
exporter
as
predicted
this
will
not
be
a
for
the
on
that
projection
in
his
bloomberg
interview
iea
executive
director
fatih
birol
drew
attention
to
the
fact
that
opec
s
decisions
today
have
a
different
nature
than
they
did
before
the
shale
revolution
this
is
the
new
game
in
town
he
birol
s
comment
is
clear
growing
shale
production
will
push
down
oil
prices
over
the
long
term
the
countries
who
did
not
see
this
happening
such
as
russia
now
face
severe
economic
challenges
the
time
of
blaming
middle
east
conflicts
for
oil
price
fluctuations
or
passively
expecting
a
russian
reaction
seems
to
be
ending
and
it
s
time
to
begin
replacing
traditional
energy
analyses
with
unconventional
looks
like
the
shale
revolution
not
russian
intervention
or
opec
strategy
will
be
what
ultimately
causes
prices
to
olgu
okumus
for
