the wildcard in opec's next deal
when
last
week
news
broke
that
libya
s
government
and
the
eastern
rival
government
might
just
be
willing
to
settle
their
differences
and
hold
elections
early
next
year
its
significance
for
oil
markets
passed
more
or
less
unnoticed
as
everyone
was
watching
opec
and
iran
now
the
head
of
libya
s
national
oil
corporation
has
suggested
that
this
significance
could
turn
out
to
be
pretty
this
week
mustafa
sanalla
told
bloomberg
that
the
noc
hoped
libya
would
be
exempted
from
any
new
production
cuts
that
are
under
discussion
by
some
opec
members
right
now
in
response
to
the
latest
oil
price
decline
the
opec
community
has
understood
the
difficulties
we
face
libya
has
withheld
more
than
any
other
country
from
the
global
market
sanalla
this
may
be
an
all
in
terms
of
production
withheld
libya
has
got
nothing
on
is
a
fact
that
libya
won
an
exemption
from
the
first
cuts
agreed
back
in
because
it
was
having
a
lot
of
trouble
keeping
its
production
steady
with
growth
not
even
a
top
priority
but
that
was
then
when
the
petroleum
facilities
guard
held
the
oil
terminals
and
used
this
to
blackmail
the
government
into
paying
for
using
the
terminals
then
came
the
libyan
national
army
led
by
general
khalifa
haftar
who
is
affiliated
with
the
rival
eastern
government
the
lna
took
over
the
terminals
and
passed
them
on
to
the
internationally
recognized
noc
to
operate
since
then
production
has
been
this
growth
has
been
uneven
as
militant
groups
continued
to
challenge
the
noc
s
control
of
libya
s
oil
industry
blockading
fields
and
pipelines
and
earlier
this
year
briefly
closing
down
two
of
the
four
export
terminals
all
this
has
had
the
expected
effect
on
oil
prices
strengthening
libya
s
reputation
as
a
wild
card
in
global
oil
yet
in
july
things
began
to
change
related
trump
thanks
saudis
for
lower
oil
prices
wants
even
cheaper
crudeat
the
time
libya
was
producing
bpd
of
crude
thanks
to
outages
and
clashes
between
lna
and
opposing
groups
at
the
oil
terminals
just
a
month
earlier
its
production
had
fallen
to
half
a
million
bpd
now
libya
is
producing
million
bpd
and
plans
are
to
boost
this
to
million
bpd
opec
s
intention
to
resume
cutting
comes
at
the
wrong
time
for
north
african
country
has
probably
the
largest
reserves
of
crude
oil
on
the
continent
and
revenues
from
selling
oil
represent
pretty
much
all
of
its
export
revenues
yet
because
of
the
chaos
that
followed
the
toppling
of
muammar
gadhafi
in
these
revenues
are
not
being
used
to
improve
the
situation
of
most
of
the
population
and
as
much
as
percent
of
libyans
live
below
the
poverty
line
now
that
there
is
a
chance
of
at
least
some
of
the
the
most
important
one
between
the
government
of
national
accord
and
the
house
of
be
on
the
road
to
resolution
things
could
and
this
is
a
big
if
this
happens
and
libya
manages
to
hold
elections
without
armed
clashes
it
would
be
stepping
on
the
road
to
recovery
and
recovery
means
higher
oil
production
the
country
simply
can
not
afford
to
cut
production
at
this
point
and
it
wouldn
t
be
able
to
afford
it
for
the
foreseeable
future
as
any
new
government
hopefully
prioritizes
putting
an
end
to
the
chaos
and
trying
to
bring
the
country
back
to
normality
if
the
elections
fail
more
oil
production
outages
are
a
certainty
and
libya
would
be
in
a
position
to
argue
for
an
exemption
from
the
same
place
it
was
two
years
ago
in
any
case
getting
it
to
agree
to
cuts
will
be
a
tough
