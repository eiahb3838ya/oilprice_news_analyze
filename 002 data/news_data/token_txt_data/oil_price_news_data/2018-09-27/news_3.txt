been
discussing
on

increase
in
their
combined
oil
production
to
keep
a
lid
on
oil
prices
unnamed
sources
told
reuters
amid
growing

the
official
saudi
stance
expressed
at
the
meeting
in
algiers
last
weekend
but
said
the
sources
riyadh
did
not
want
to
make
the
discussions
public
in
order
to
avoid
upsetting
those
opec
members
that
did
not
have
enough
spare
production
capacity
to
deploy
quickly
enough
to
weather
the
effects
of
the
iran
there
are
only
two
months
left
until
the
end
of
the
year
so
why
create
tensions
now
between
saudi
arabia
iran
and
russia
one

tensions
between
saudi
arabia
and
iran

the

the
cause
for

is
a
