the biggest wildcard in the iran sanctions saga
in
the
last
hours
there
have
been
two
fascinating
media
reports
about
the
iran
sanctions
one
is
a
bloomberg
story
saying
indian
refiners
will
not
buy
any
iranian
crude
in
november
the
other
is
a
reuters
story
quoting
a
government
official
as
saying
new
delhi
has
not
told
refiners
to
stop
buying
iranian
crude
these
two
stories
don
t
just
offer
two
different
perspectives
they
demonstrate
exactly
how
confusing
the
situation
is
and
how
much
more
confusing
it
could
become
and
meanwhile
the
truth
remains
out
s
sources
from
several
of
india
s
largest
biggest
iranian
crude
be
telling
the
truth
or
they
may
be
saying
something
that
the
united
states
wants
to
hear
if
they
are
telling
the
truth
shipping
data
would
support
this
soon
enough
if
they
stop
buying
iranian
crude
they
will
have
to
find
a
replacement
for
those
bpd
that
they
had
been
importing
from
iran
as
per
bloomberg
shipping
is
no
mention
of
alternative
supplies
in
the
story
what
there
is
however
is
the
caveat
that
it
is
basically
too
early
to
say
if
these
refiners
will
import
iranian
crude
final
decisions
are
only
due
early
next
month
put
simply
these
statements
from
refinery
officials
could
be
nothing
more
than
much
ado
about
nothing
shipping
data
will
story
comes
from
a
government
official
who
has
remained
unnamed
but
who
has
made
a
point
of
telling
the
agency
there
has
been
no
decision
by
new
delhi
to
halt
imports
that
shouldn
t
be
a
surprise
an
earlier
statement
from
another
government
official
had
this
to
say
we
want
to
make
the
point
that
india
is
heavily
reliant
on
oil
imports
for
its
consumption
needs
and
percent
of
its
oil
comes
from
external
sources
and
here
s
another
statement
from
last
week
indian
refiners
may
start
paying
for
iranian
crude
in
rupees
from
november
on
as
the
sanctions
kick
in

booston
the
one
hand
we
have
some
wary
refinery
officials
and
on
the
other
we
have
several
more
optimistic
government
officials
meanwhile
the
washington
times
reported
monday
that
iranian
tankers
have
started
turning
off
their
trackers
as
they
leave
the
strait
of
hormuz

this
information
even

explaining

that

of
very

from
the
institute
of

finance
revealed
this
week
reuters
cited
the
institution
as
saying
this
was
down
from
million
bpd
in
april
as
importers
took
the
cautious
path
south
korea
stopped
buying
iranian
crude
in
july
and
japan
earlier
this
month
india
too
reduced
its
intake
of
iranian
oil
as
it
seeks
to
balance
its
ties
with
tehran
and
its
ties
with
washington
both
probably
equally
important
for
the
the
big
we
see
indian
imports
of
iranian
crude
fall
to
likely
to
have
an
answer
in
the
negative
it
would
be
difficult
for
india
to
afford
to
alienate
iran
as
its
oil
consumption
grows
alienating
washington
on
the
other
hand
is
less
likely

china
