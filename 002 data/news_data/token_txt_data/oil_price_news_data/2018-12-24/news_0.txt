why the oil price bear market persists
in
i
began
warning
about
the
risk
to
oil
prices
due
to
the
ongoing
imbalances
between
global
supply
and
demand
those
warnings
fell
on
deaf
ears
as
it
was
believed
that
oil
prices
could
only
go
higher
from
it
didn
t
take
long
for
those
predictions
to
play
out
in
may
of
i
wrote
while
it
is
likely
oil
prices
could
get
a
bit
of
a
bump
from
a
decline
in
the
dollar
ultimately
it
will
come
down
to
the
fundamentals
longer
term
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
speculative
rise
in
oil
prices
due
to
the
fracking
miracle
has
come
to
its
inglorious
but
expected
is
quite
apparent
that
some
lessons
are
simply
never
learned
of
course
as
with
all
things
particularly
when
it
comes
to
commodities
it
doesn
t
take
long
for
speculation
to
once
again
grab
hold
and
drive
prices
higher
in
the
despite
the
fundamental
problems
which
still
september
of
i
wrote
a
piece
reviewing
those
i
have
been
getting
a
tremendous
number
of
emails
as
of
late
asking
if
the
latest
rally
in
oil
prices
and
related
energy
stocks
is
sustainable
or
is
it
another
trap
as
has
been
witnessed
regular
readers
know
we
exited
oil
and
gas
stocks
back
in
and
have
remained
out
of
the
sector
for
technical
and
fundamental
reasons
for
the
duration
while
there
have
been
some
opportunistic
trading
setups
the
technical
backdrop
has
remained
decidedly
the
conclusion
was
not
what
most
were
hoping
while
there
is
hope
the
production
cuts
will
continue
into
a
bulk
of
the
current
price
gain
has
likely
already
been
priced
in
with
oil
prices
once
again
overbought
on
a
monthly
basis
the
risk
of
disappointment
is
well
here
we
are
wrapping
up
and
the
prices
of
both
shares
and
oil
have
been
expected
decline
in
oil
prices
is
more
important
than
just
the
relative
decline
in
share
prices
of
stocks
as
i
wrote
previously
energy
prices
are
highly
correlated
to
economic
activity
to
wit
oil
is
a
highly
sensitive
indicator
relative
to
the
expansion
or
contraction
of
the
economy
given
that
oil
is
consumed
in
virtually
every
aspect
of
our
lives
from
the
food
we
eat
to
the
products
and
services
we

one
important
note
is
that

tends
to

that

as
such
it
is
not
surprising
that
sharp
declines
in
oil
prices
have
been
coincident
with
downturns
in
economic
activity
a
drop
in
inflation
and
a
subsequent
decline
in
interest
since
then
the
price
of
oil
has
declined
further
as
economic
weakness
continues
to
gain
traction
globally
despite
the
occasional

it

hard

the
outlook
for
oil
is
encouraging
on
both
fundamental
and
technical
levels
the

while
the

the

create
a
issue
for
prices

particularly
in
the
face
of
weaker

due
to
demographics
energy

and
point
to
the
commodity
crash
as
the
example
as
to
why
oil
prices
are
destined
to
rise

the
clear
issue
remains

it
relates
to
the
price

any
commodity

basin
expanding
currently
any
cuts
by
opec
have
already
been
offset
by
increased
domestic
production
as
i
stated
previously
any
rise
in
oil
prices
beyond
would
likely
make
the
opec
cuts
very
which
indeed
turned
out
to
be
the
case
as
noted
in
the
chart
above
the
difference
between
and
today
is
that
previously
the
world
was
fearful
of
running
out
of
oil
versus
worries
about
an
oil
glut
today
the
issues
of
supply

price
become
clearer
if
we
look
further
back
in
history
to
the
last
crash
in
commodity
prices
which
marked
an
extremely
long
period
of

price
suppression

click

the
problem
with
the
recent
surge

the

cocktail
for

as

the

the

either
