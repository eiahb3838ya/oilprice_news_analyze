production growth in the permian to hit new record
the
current
pipeline
constraints
in
the
permian
have
been
caused
by
the
booming
production
recorded
since
the
crude
oil
price
recovered
in
while
production
has
burgeoned
the
necessary
pipeline
infrastructure
has
been
slow
to
midland
to
cushing
wti
spreads
widened
and
us
crude
output
remained
flat
in
production
slowdown
was
thought
to
be
an
indication
that
pipeline
constraints
were
limiting
growth
in
the
permian
the
entire
lower
states
grew
only
in
may
after
seeing
an
average
monthly
growth
of
in
the
previous
three
the
tightening
pipeline
capacity
the
latest
kayrros
data
show
that
the
production
growth
in
june
is
actually
hitting
record
highs
there
was
an
overall
increase
of
about

texas
and
new
mexico
according
to
kayrros
data
in
contrast
the
eia
predictions
estimated
a
growth
rate
of
for
the
entire
lower
states
the
official
eia
monthly
figures
for
june
are
expected
on
current
midland
to
cushing
wti
spread
stands
around
according
to
cme
historically
high
number
the
future
projections
show
the
spread
narrowing
slowly
in
accordance
with
the
planned
pipeline
extensions
the
heavy
midland
discount
is
an
indicator
that
producers
are
using
costlier
transportation
methods
like
trains
and
trucks
to
get
the
oil
from
where
it
is
produced
to
where
it
is
stored
