would the u.s. sanction china for buying iranian oil?
a
state
department
official
has
suggested
that
washington
could
impose
sanctions
on
china
if
it
continues
to
buy
iranian
oil
after
november
when
sanctions
specifically
targeting
iranian
oil
sales
abroad
will

newly
appointed
special
representative
and
head
of
an
iran
action
group
at
the
state
department
as
saying
that
the
united
states
certainly
hopes
for
full
compliance
by
all
nations
in
terms
of
not
risking
the
threat
of
secondary
sanctions
if
they
continue
with
those
in
addition
brian
hook
declined
to
rule
out
the
possibility
that
the
united
states
could
count
china
among
those
targeted
by
secondary
sanctions
for
its
repeatedly
stated
intention
to
continue
buying
iranian
crude
despite
this
month
the
united
states
managed
to
secure
a
promise
from
china
that
it
will
not
expand
its
iranian
oil
imports
but
given
the
tariff
escalation
between
the
two
it
s
possible
that
china
could
revoke
this
promise
this
is
more
than
likely
unless
of
course
the
next
talks
which
are
planned
for
later
this
month
put
an
end
to
what
everybody
is
already
calling
a
trade
war

was
set
up
this
week
to
direct
and
coordinate
all
activity
relating
to
iran
as
per
wsj
s
report
the
purpose
of
the
administration
is
to
apply
maximum
pressure
on
tehran
in

of
spurring
a

that

not
work
out
as
well
this
time
as
it
did
in
oil
is
the
target
of
the
sanctions
and
washington
officials
have
been
very
busy
in
the
last
few
months
trying
to
secure
commitments
from
its
allies
that
they
will
stop
importing
iranian
oil
the
task
has
proved
challenging
however
because
of
china
other
asian
importers
of
iranian
oil
are
hoping
to
secure
waivers
from
the
sanctions
because
they
would
be
hard
put
to
quickly
find
an
alternative
to
the
attractively
priced
