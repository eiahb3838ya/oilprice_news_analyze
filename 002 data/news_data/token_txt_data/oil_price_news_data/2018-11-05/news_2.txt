after

announced
its
withdrawal
from

on

conference
secretary

secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
has
also
implicitly
warned
india
and
china
that
there
would
be
consequences
if
the
two
countries
continue
to
buy
iranian
oil
after
the
sanctions
against
tehran
went
into
effect
watch
the
iranians
that
is
who
really
understands
the
actions
we
are
taking
pompeo
told
fox
news
in
an
interview
on
sunday
in
response
to
a
question
about
whether
washington
can
make
sure
china
and
india
will
eventually
stop
importing
iranian
oil
pompeo
said
chris
wallace
watch
what
we
do
watch
as
we
already
taken
more
crude
oil
off
the
market
than
any
time
in
previous
history
watch
the
efforts
that
president
trump
policies
have
achieved
we
done
all
of
this
too
chris
while
making
sure
that
american
consumers
do
although
this
is
far
from
anything
specific
the
comments
come
a
couple
of
days
after
russia
s
energy
minister
alexander
novak
told
the
financial
times
that
russia
will
continue
to
buy
iranian
crude
and
help
tehran
sell
it
abroad
because
of
this
timing
some
saw
in
pompeo
s
words
a
thinly
veiled
warning
to
russia
as
well
related
why
trump
decided
to
back
down
on
iran
we
believe
we
should
look
for
mechanisms
that
would
allow
us
to
continue
developing
with
our
partners
with
iran
novak
told
the
russia
buys
iranian
crude
under
an
swap
deal
inked
in
and
then
resells
it
to
other
countries
when
asked
by
the
ft
if
there
were
plans
to
expand
the
volume
of
oil
traded
novak
said
moscow
will
first
assess
the
effects
of
the
sanctions
before
making
a
decision
on
s
comments
are
certainly
in
tune
with
the
general
sentiment
in
washington
but
they
might
not
reflect
the
reality
of
the
decline
in
iranian
exports
the
latest
data
suggests
the
drop
in
exports
between
may
and
september
has
not
been
that
great
of
course
since
september
things
might
have
thing
has
changed
for
certain
in
late
october
all
iranian
tankers
turned
off
their
geolocation
devices
the
afp
reported
citing
meaning
a
lot
of
oil
could
be
headed
abroad
but
this
won
t
become
immediately
evident
if
this
becomes
evident
it
would
certainly
undermine
the
upbeat
mood
and
probably
lead
to
an
even
more
hawkish
stance
