the rapid acceleration towards peak oil demand
the
drumbeat
towards
peak
oil
demand
is
accelerating
but
since
much
of
the
acceleration
is
happening
outside
of
the
united
states
its
cadence
is
be
clear
the
developed
world
passed
peak
oil
demand
a
decade
ago
and
has
for
years
been
forecast
to
continue
reducing
its
demand
increasing
demand
in
industrializing
countries
particularly
china
and
india
each
with
a
population
tantamount
to
that
of
the
oecd
slightly
overpowers
declines
in
the
developed
world
and
as
a
result
global
demand
continues
to
increase
in
its
world
energy
outlook
the
iea
forecast
increase
outside
the
oecd
in
the
oecd
and
an
overall
growth
of
global
peak
demand
will
likely
occur
while
developing
world
demand
is
still
growing
increased
decline
in
the
first
world
could
crest
demand
but
merely
slowing
the
growth
in
the
rest
of
the
world
is
the
more
likely
to
tip
the
global
balance
to
plateau
then
for
oil
is
dominated
by
transportation
cars
planes
and
boats
and
industry
plastics
fertilizers
passenger
vehicles
comprise
about
of
global
oil
demand
and
thus
are
the
number
one
target
for
major
emissions
reductions
when
the
iea
released
its
world
energy
outlook
mentioned
above
not
a
country
on
the
planet
had
stated
plans
to
ban
new
sales
of
cars
only
japan
and
portugal
had
even
created
incentives
for
electric
vehicles
in
three
european
countries
outlined
plans
to
end
sales
of
new
gasoline
and
diesel
engines
before
the
year
was
over
iea
revised
its
oecd
forecast
downward
to
per
a
rash
of
targets
to
constrain
fossil
fuels
for
cars
led
forbes
to
declare
it
to
be
the
year
europe
got
serious
about
killing
the
internal
combustion
in
even
more
european
countries
have
joined
the
list
stating
their
intent
to
end
the
sale
of
new
petroleum
vehicles
at
some
point
between
to
also
this
year
the
trend
has
expanded
out
of
europe
to
israel
costa
rica
and
taiwan
with
targets
as
early
as
over
the
same
three
years
to
present
metropolitan
areas
from
these
and
other
countries
announced
their
own
plans
to
end
the
use
not
just
sale
of
gasoline
diesel
vehicles
and
mostly
before
or
by
related
why
are
middle
eastern
lng
imports
soaring
what
is
more
remarkable
china
and
india
the
titans
of
demand
growth
both
declared
similar
intentions
in
china
announced
its
study
of
a
plan
to
end
sales
and
production
of
cars
by
and
india
asserted
it
wants
to
end
new
sales
by
the
plans
are
not
enforceable
as
law
yet
either
in
asia
or
in
europe
and
electric
vehicles
currently
constitute
only
a
trivial
portion
to
of
vehicles
in
china
and
india
the
discrepancy
between
target
and
current
reality
though
points
less
to
the
improbability
of
perfection
as
it
does
to
the
political
will
for
progress
and
progress
alone
not
perfection
is
sufficient
to
trigger
peak
demand
and
the
tectonic
shifts
that
go
with
who
wonder
if
these
forecasts
are
accurate
can
look
to
the
history
of
the
greening
of
electricity
generation
in
europe
and
china
and
particularly
in
india
where
targets
for
are
being
raised
as
momentum
gathers
based
on
technological
progress
similarly
the
rash
of
new
entrants
and
accelerated
development
of
electric
cars
demonstrates
the
depth
of
changes
now
expected
in
passenger
a
year
after
china
declared
its
intentions
to
reduce
research
arm
of
china
national
petroleum
corp
issued
its
own
research
report
on
use
it
concluded
that
china
s
demand
for
diesel
fuel
has
already
peaked
that
its
gasoline
demand
will
peak
in
and
that
the
country
s
oil
demand
will
peak
in
far
sooner
than
forecast
from
a
distance
by
american
and
european
these
trends
though
only
implicitly
the
iea
recently
released
a
major
report
describing
how
demand
growth
to
and
would
be
driven
primarily
by
demand
for
petrochemicals
especially
plastics
instead
of
transportation
petrochemicals
make
up
only
of
use
today
but
account
for
of
projected
demand
growth
rising
nearly
two
and
half
times
as
fast
as
transportation
which
makes
up
of
current
demand
the
familiar
argument
by
iea
asserts
that
china
india
and
others
will
approach
the
same
levels
of
plastic
use
as
western
countries
which
they
note
use
up
to
times
as
much
per
capita
they
expect
that
packaging
will
account
for
over
a
third
of
plastics
dynamics
of
demand
for
plastics
too
though
seem
to
be
changing
rapidly
especially
for
single
use
plastics
such
as
packaging
data
in
the
same
iea
report
shows
that
western
countries
have
already
begun
to
curtail
their
per
capita
use
of
plastics
and
one
could
expect
that
the
developing
world
will
pursue
the
same
kinds
of
policies
in
the
same
way
as
they
have
with
transportation
fuels
in
fact
the
developing
world
is
leading
the
charge
related
there
s
no
strong
fundamental
reason
for
oil
s
declinewhile
the
us
has
sometimes
targeted
plastic
bags
and
recently
fiddled
with
banning
straws
the
eu
has
proposed
not
passed
a
ban
on
a
spectrum
of
plastics
on
the
other
hand
rwanda
was
a
pioneer
in
banning
plastic
bags
and
china
has
now
begun
enforcing
a
similar
ban
when
europe
began
talking
about
a
ban
of
the
states
of
india
had
already
passed
some
kind
of
restriction
on
plastics
then
last
summer
india
s
national
government
announced
its
intent
to
ban
all
plastics
by
china
and
india
don
t
want
plastic
pollution
in
the
water
any
more
than
they
do
combustion
pollution
in
the
air
and
for
those
countries
reforms
are
a
matter
of
public
health
while
the
us
has
historically
collected
and
interred
or
exported
to
china
much
of
its
plastic
trash
littered
plastics
in
developing
countries
often
breed
disease
and
affect

month
two
independent
studies
predicted
peak
oil
demand
in
the
early
as
in
the
base
case
the
rapid
evolution
and
adoption
these
analysts
see
as
obvious
has
gotten
hardly
a
nod
in
the
mainstream
last
spring
bp
s
statistical
review
of
world
energy
became
the
first
major
forecaster
to
acknowledge
explicitly
that
the
increased
cadence
of
evolution
in
the
demand
for
oil
makes
predictions
difficult
since
the
iea
completely
missed
the
timing
of
peak
oil
demand
in
the
developed
world
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
whether
its
annual
outlook
to
be
released
next
month
reflects
recent
developments
it
will
be
even
more
interesting
to
see
whether
anyone
takes
notice
if
it
does
meanwhile
news
like
last
month
s
un
climate
change
report
continues
to
build
the
sense
of
urgency
to
protect
mankind
