venezuelaâ€™s oil exports are falling even faster than expected
a
delay
in
port
repairs
following
a
tanker
collision
is
putting
additional
pressure
on
already
pressured
venezuelan
crude
oil
exports
reuters
quoted
anonymous
sources
close
to
pdvsa
as
saying
this
week
it
seems
that
venezuela
s
woes
are
only
multiplying
as
time
goes
by
although
news
from
official
caracas
sources
seems
more
upbeat
oil
however
appears
at
the
forefront
of
venezuela
s
dock
at
venezuela
s
biggest
oil
port
jose
was
closed
in
late
august
after
a
tanker
collided
with
it
at
the
time
reuters
reported
that
the
repairs
would
delay
the
delivery
of
million
barrels
of
crude
destined
for
rosneft
which
according
to
the
news
outlet
could
put
a
strain
on
relations
between
the
russian
company
and
pdvsa
which
have
a
agreement
this
is
only
the
latest
in
pdvsa
s
troubles
with
its
oil
a
steady
decline
in
production
venezuela
s
oil
company
earlier
this
year
ran
into
problems
with
its
storage
capacity
and
export
terminals
in
the
caribbean
as
conocophillips
took
an
aggressive
approach
to
enforcing
a
court
ruling
that
awarded
it
us
billion
in
compensation
for
the
forced
nationalization
of
two
projects
in
venezuela
the
company
this
summer
seized
several
of
pdvsa
s
assets
on
caribbean
islands
which
made
it
difficult
for
the
venezuelan
state
company
to
meet
its
export
obligations
having
few
options
pdvsa
eventually
caved
settling
with
repairs
are
further
complicating
matters
pdvsa
is
supposed
to
deliver
to
rosneft
some
million
bpd
of
crude
under
the
latest
bilateral
agreement
signed
this
april
on
top
of
that
it
normally
exports
crude
for
valero
energy
and
chevron
from
the
same
dock
the
south
dock
of
the
jose
port
which
is
responsible
for
processing
processes
as
much
as
percent
of
the
country
s
crude
oil
to
anyone
s
surprise
the
delay
in
resuming
shipments
is
largely
a
result
of
insufficient
funds
partially
thanks
to
sanctions
which
have
essentially
closed
nearly
completely
the
door
to
foreign
funding
china
not
bound
by
these
restrictions
recently
agreed
to
a
us
lifeline
for
the
venezuelan
government
and
its
oil
industry
but
these
billions
will
take
time
to
become
available
given
the
multitude
of
problems
that
pdvsa
is
having
it
would
be
a
tough
job
to
allocate
these
funds
so
that
there
is
enough
for
everything
related
the
billion
deal
that
could
revive
the
aramco
ipocaracas
is
still
not
giving
up
just
this
week
the
government
announced
the
official
launch
of
the
petro
on
international
markets
in
hopes
of
offsetting
the
effects
of
sanctions
by
using
this
cryptocurrency
president
nicolas
maduro
said
at
the
launch
that
the
petro
would
be
legal
tender
for
everything
in
venezuela
including
as
a
substitute
for
the
dollar
all
venezuelans
will
have
access
to
the
petro
and
through
it
to
make
international
purchases
maduro
also
plans
to
boost
its
oil
exports
to
china
as
part
of
plans
to
transform
its
economy
and
get
back
on
its
feet
to
this
end
it
will
work
with
chinese
oil
companies
to
improve
production
maduro
said
in
july
that
pdvsa
would
boost
oil
production
by
million
bpd
from
june
levels
by
the
end
of
the
year
although
he
admitted
that
this
goal
would
be
difficult
to
achieve
venezuela
pumped
million
bpd
in
august
and
the
average
stands
at
million
bpd
this
is
a
far
cry
from
the
figure
from
five
years
ago
when
its
daily
average
was
million
bpd
it
s
a
matter
of
a
short
time
to
see
if
the
petro
and
chinese
money
will
be
enough
to
reverse
the
decline
in
production
