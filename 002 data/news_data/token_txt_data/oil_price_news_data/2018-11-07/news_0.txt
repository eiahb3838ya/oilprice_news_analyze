crude

reached
a
new

record
of

in

exceeding
million

for
the
first
time
production
in
august
was
bpd
higher
than

in

steo
and
it
was
this
higher

that
raised

in

the

now
sees
crude

hitting

the

forecasts
are
partly
the
result
of
higher
expected
crude
oil
production
in
the
united

in
the
second
half
of

in
which
is
expected
to
contribute
to
growth
in

oil
inventory
and
put
downward
pressure
on
crude

prices
the
eia
production
will
be
growing
despite
the
current
capacity
constraints
in

have

yet
the

of

see
those

as
temporary
and
likely
starting
to
ease
