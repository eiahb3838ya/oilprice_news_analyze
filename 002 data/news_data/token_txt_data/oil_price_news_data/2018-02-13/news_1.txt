oil price correction unlikely to harm european majors
europe
s
oil
supermajors
have
largely
adapted
to
lower
oil
prices
thanks
to
strict
financial
discipline
and
efforts
to
bring
down
their
breakeven
levels
a
new
report
from
fitch
says
adding
to
a
growing
body
of
evidence
that
the
oil
industry
has
managed
to
weather
the
effects
of
the
latest
price
fact
these
companies
have
managed
that
so
well
that
now
they
are
canceling
their
scrip
dividend
policies
and
raising
dividends
following
the
confidence
boost
from
last
year
when
improving
prices
and
continuing
cost
discipline
led
to
financial
results
beating
analyst
total
for
instance
reported
a
increase
in
net
profits
for
and
announced
it
will
start
buying
back
shares
issued
to
shareholders
instead
of
dividends
the
french
company
also
said
it
will
hike
dividends
by
a
tenth
over
the
next
three
years
in
further
demonstration
that
the
worst
is
over
and
the
horizon
is
also
reported
strong
results
with
operational
cash
flow
rising
to
billion
from
billion
a
year
earlier
and
like
total
pledged
to
start
paying
cash
dividends
the
company
also
has
plans
to
reduce
its
organic
breakeven
point
to
a
barrel
this
year
and
further
to
in
eventually
bp
sees
its
breakeven
level
at
a
third
european
supermajor
shell
which
recently
made
clear
it
plans
to
take
on
exxon
as
the
world
s
largest
oil
company
is
basking
in
the
light
of
a
fatter
bottom
line
though
the
reported
lower
cash
flow
for
than
for
despite
this
profits
from
oil
at
a
barrel
are
on
par
with
the
profits
the
company
generated
when
brent
traded
at
a
barrel
related
is
this
the
beginning
of
a
downturn
in
oil
all
three
have
declared
their
intentions
to
return
more
cash
to
shareholders
but
this
could
cost
them
a
downward
revision
of
their
credit
ratings
according
to
fitch
the
supermajors
need
to
treat
debt
reduction
as
a
top
priority
the
ratings
agency
said
rather
than
shareholder
returns
if
they
reprioritize
in
favor
of
returns
some
of
their
ratings
might
have
to
be
reason
for
this
cautious
attitude
seems
to
be
that
fitch
is
quite
a
bit
more
skeptical
about
oil
prices
potential
to
rise
further
unlike
most
leading
investment
banks
fitch
expects
brent
crude
to
fall
to
around
and
stay
within
that
range
this
could
do
big
oil
good
though
at
least
according
to
fitch
whenever
oil
prices
rise
oil
companies
tend
to
give
away
their
cost
savings
in
the
form
of
improved
shareholder
returns
in
a
still
volatile
environment
and
with
pretty
hefty
debt
piles
this
would
not
be
the
best
idea
at
the
moment
the
ratings
agency
is
not
how
big
oil
sees
things
however
a
recent
story
by
reuters
ron
bousso
noted
how
now
that
the
worst
is
over
the
supermajors
will
be
fighting
for
investors
favors
with
promises
of
stable
strong
growth
and
higher
dividends
bousso
called
this
a
beauty
contest
noting
shell
s
and
total
s
program
aimed
at
making
the
companies
more
attractive
to
shareholders
by
ensuring
that
growth
they
are
now
making
a
top
priority
along
with
shareholder
it
seems
that
though
most
of
the
clouds
have
cleared
and
supermajors
have
money
to
pay
cash
dividends
and
buy
smaller
rivals
and
alternative
