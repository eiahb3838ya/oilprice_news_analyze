is history repeating itself in oil markets?
back
in
shale
production
was
growing
so
fast
that
it
ended
up
crashing
the
market
now
history
could
be
repeating
was
the
warning
from
the
international
energy
agency
which
said
in
its
latest
oil
market
report
that
a
second
wave
of
shale
supply
threatens
another
global
oil
supply
is
expected
to
grow
faster
than
demand
this
year
which
could
lead
to
another
downturn
it
s
a
conclusion
that
the
iea
tried
to
emphasize
in
previous
reports
but
the
message
finally
seems
to
be
sinking
extraordinary
run
up
in
benchmark
prices
in
december
and
january
came
to
a
startling
end
two
weeks
ago
part
of
the
reason
was
because
of
the
broader
market
turmoil
in
equities
and
part
of
it
was
because
hedge
funds
and
other
money
managers
had
overbought
oil
futures
exposing
the
market
to
a
price
as
the
iea
notes
the
real
worry
is
rising
oil
supply
which
means
that
the
underlying
oil
market
fundamentals
in
the
early
part
of
look
less
supportive
for
it
isn
t
all
bad
news
for
benchmark
prices
the
iea
noted
that
due
to
the
opec
production
cuts
and
strong
demand
inventories
fell
at
a
remarkable
rate
last
year
the
oil
inventory
surplus
currently
stands
at
about
million
barrels
above
the
average
down
sharply
from
million
barrels
a
year
ago
importantly
while
crude
oil
inventories
are
closing
in
on
the
average
total
stocks
of
gasoline
and
other
refined
products
have
already
fallen
well
below
that
threshold
with
the
surplus
having
shrunk
so
dramatically
the
success
of
the
output
agreement
might
be
close
to
hand

but
even
as
the
elusive
balance
in
the
oil
market
is
within
reach
the
iea
says
things
might
quickly
reason
why
the
oil
market
might
suffer
from
a
renewed
glut
largely
comes
down
to
soaring
shale
production
in
the
period
ending
in
november
the
added
a
colossal
the
iea
noted
with
even
steeper
gains
expected
this
year
the
bearish
forecast
comes
a
week
after
the
eia
said
much
of
the
same
thing
shale
output
is
rising
so
quickly
that
the
could
reach
million
barrels
per
day
this
year
instead
of
next
year
by
the
end
of
the
could
surpass
russia
and
saudi
arabia
in
terms
of
total
iea
says
that
the
stars
are
aligning
for
shale
with
rising
prices
leading
after
a
few
months
to
more
drilling
more
completions
more
production
and
more
some
of
these
figures
and
forecasts
have
been
floating
around
for
a
little
while
now
but
the
iea
put
the
situation
in
stark
terms
the
agency
says
that
the
current
growth
trajectory
in
shale
production
is
reminiscent
of
the
first
wave
of
us
shale
growth
that
riding
the
tide
of
high
oil
prices
in
the
early
years
of
this
decade
made
big
gains
in
terms
of
market
share
and
eventually
in
forced
a
historic
change
of
policy
by
leading
supply
growth
from
the
alone
could
equal
total
global
demand
other
words
shale
growth
could
crash
oil
prices
again
and
the
only
thing
preventing
a
collapse
is
opec
sticking
with
its
production
limits
back
in
the
cartel
decided
to
abandon
market
management
which
precipitated
the
meltdown
this
is
a
sobering
thought
for
otherproducers
currently
sitting
on
production
capacity
and
facing
a
renewed
challenge
to
their
market
share
the
iea
price
meltdown
isn
t
an
inevitability
demand
looks
strong
and
could
expand
by
more
than
everyone
assumes
meanwhile
venezuela
s
rapid
deterioration
could
also
take
more
oil
supply
off
of
the
market
if
opec
maintains
high
levels
of
compliance
the
oil
market
could
weather
the
new
wave
of
shale
supply
and
return
to
a
more
bullish
footing
later
this
year
as
demand
soaks
up
the
if
demand
disappoints
or
if
more
supply
comes
from
unexpected
places
libya

hit

then
things
look
pretty
pessimistic
at

supply
could
bring
a

of
