gom
has
been
a
tremendous
resource
that
has
largely
been
developed
over
the
last
thirty
years
or
so
one
by

companies
ventured
into
deep
waters
using
their
wits
and
brawn
to
bring
these
deeply
buried
resources
to
market
wits
and
brawn
and
a
lot
of
money
many
companies
learned
the
hard
way
that
deep
water
was
not
a
fun
place
to
play
if
your
checking
account
was
low
the
companies
who
were
adequately
capitalized
did
well
rebounding
from
the
initial
steepness
of
the
learning
curve

add
huge

production

to

those
of
us
who
drive
and
use
gas
to
heat
our
homes
can
be
glad
they
were
successful
as
now
much
of
the
daily
offshore
production
comes
from

the
oil
industry
s
advance
into
deeper
waters
has
been
a
fairly
gradual
one
led
primarily
by
the
marine
engineering
developments
that
occurred
as
fields
farther

farther
offshore
were
explored

made

a
tremendous
initial
burst
in

activity
geologists
began

run
out

prospects
and
the
pace
of
new
discoveries
slowed
only
the
fairly
recent
ability
to
see

activity

led

continued
with
