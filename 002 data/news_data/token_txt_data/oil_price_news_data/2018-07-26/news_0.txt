tight oil markets are ignoring supply risk
the
global
oil
market
is
once
again
in
flux
as
geopolitics
and
regional
conflicts
take
an
increasingly
heavy
toll
on
oil
supplies
since
the
opec
meeting
in
vienna
warning
signs
that
oil
markets
are
heading
for
a
shortage
in
supply
due
to
low
spare
production
capacity
and
growing
security
threats
in
and
around
the
persian
gulf
have
not
been
taken
into
perceived
oil
production
increase
from
the
opec
and
russia
agreement
has
not
materialized
in
full
analysts
are
even
reporting
that
the
spare
production
capacity
of
saudi
arabia
is
less
than
lack
of
production
capacity
must
now
become
a
major
point
of
focus
as
in
addition
to
the
ongoing
confrontation
in
the
strait
of
hormuz
iranian
backed
yemeni
houthi
rebels
have
once
again
attacked
saudi
oil
tankers
in
the
red
sea
in
response
saudi
arabia
has
suspended
oil
shipments
through
the
bab
strait
for
an
undisclosed
period
of
stated
that
in
the
interest
of
the
safety
of
ships
and
their
crews
and
to
avoid
the
risk
of
oil
spill
saudi
aramco
has
temporarily
halted
all
oil
shipments
through
bab
with
immediate
effect
the
company
is
carefully
assessing
the
situation
and
will
take
further
action
as
prudence
demands
though
no
casualties
have
been
reported
the
current
situation
is
undeniably
dangerous
and
has
been
escalating
this
far
in
the
houthis
have
threatened
to
increase
their
attacks
on
saudi
or
arab
alliance
owned
vessels
on
april
a
saudi
tanker
was
shot
at
with
a
projectile
from
houthi
fighters
several
other
houthi
attacks
have
been
reported
against
commercial
vessels
in
the
red

the
saudi
reaction
to
these
attacks
is
likely
to
lead
to
an
upward

as
it
has
emphasized
the
level
of
risk
in
the
area
around
million
bpd
of
saudi
oil
and
petroleum
products
pass
through
the
saudi
arabia

customers
this
development
in
undoubtedly
going
to
cause
problems
a
slowdown
of
saudi
products
to
key
markets
in
the

eu
will
have
an
impact
on
prices
the
market
may
soon
realize
that
the
time
of
secure
oil
supplies
is
now
behind
supplies
and
geopolitical
risks
need
to
be
reassessed
and
revalued

have
been

about

stir
some
fear

it
