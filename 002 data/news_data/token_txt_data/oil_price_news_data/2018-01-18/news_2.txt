oil prices rebound after eia reports another large crude draw
amid
emerging
doubts
that
opec
and
russia
have
outdone
themselves
with
the
oil
production
cuts
and
are
starting
to
suffer
the
consequences
the
energy
information
administration
reported
another
large
draw
in
oil
inventories
this
week
at
million
barrels
the
draw
is
significant
enough
to
support
a
further
price
rise
for
wti
yesterday
the
american
petroleum
institute
reported
yet
another
draw
of
million
barrels
keeping
spirits
high
analysts
expected
the
eia
to
report
its
ninth
straight
weekly
inventory
draw
with
a
reuters
poll
setting
the
size
of
the
draw
at
million
barrels
the
same
as
last
week
s
analyst
poll
by
platts
showed
in
gasoline
the
eia
reported
another
build
of
million
barrels
for
the
week
to
january
that
s
compared
to
a
build
in
the
prior
week
production
of
the
fuel
averaged
million
bpd
last
week
up
from
million
bpd
in
the
week
to
january
last
week
the
eia
shook
markets
with
the
latest
edition
of
its
energy
outlook
in
which
the
authority
forecast
oil
production
would
reach
million
barrels
daily
this
year
and
rise
further
to
million
bpd
in
late
this
has
not
affected
prices
negatively
however
as
supply
continues
to
tighten
according
to
observers
related
are
hedge
funds
pushing
oil
prices
too
high
as
a
result
two
banks
have
already
raised
their
price
targets
for
oil
for
this
year
bofa
said
it
had
revised
its
supply
and
demand
forecast
for
the
year
and
now
expected
a
deficit
of
bpd
versus
an
earlier
one
of
bpd
as
a
result
bofa
now
expects
brent
crude
to
average
us
a
barrel
and
wti
to
hover
around
us
a
barrel
that
s
up
from
us
and
us
a
barrel
respectively
some
analysts
are
warning
that
in
this
environment
opec
and
russia
may
reconsider
their
cut
strategy
for
this
year
and
agree
to
phase
the
deal
out
earlier
than
the
december
expiry
date
that
s
because
higher
oil
prices
are
making
their
oil
less
competitive
especially
with
the
nice
discount
wti
traditionally
enjoys
to
brent
and
crude
blends
tied
to
it
at
the
time
of
writing
wti
was
trading
at
us
a
barrel
and
brent
was
changing
hands
at
us
a
barrel
