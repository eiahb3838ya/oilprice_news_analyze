how the eu is helping iran skirt sanctions
at
the
un
general
assembly
on
tuesday
president
donald
trump
was
laughed
at
by
global
leaders
when
he
boasted
about
his
accomplishments
he
may
feel
insulted
by
the
reception
he
got
in
new
york
but
a
day
earlier
his
administration
saw
a
more
tangible
display
of
how
much
the
international
community
opposes
some
of
his
monday
the
european
union
announced
a
decision
to
launch
a
special
purpose
vehicle
with
the
mission
of
helping
iran
blunt
the
impact
of
sanctions
iran
is
still
in
compliance
with
its
obligations
under
the
nuclear
deal
according
to
the
international
atomic
energy
agency
and
the
signatories
aside
from
the
remain
firmly
in
the
deal
we
are
not
backing
down
on
the
iran
nuclear
agreement
said
a
european
diplomat
according
to
the
wall
street
is
nearly
friendless
in
its
quest
to
tear
up
the
iran
nuclear
deal
save
for
saudi
arabia
and
israel
and
the
eu
s
initiative
is
intended
to
keep
the
accord
alive
china
and
russia
offered
their
support
for
the
new
financing
despite
their
support
iran
has
been
hit
hard
by
sanctions
as
the
world
dials
back
on
its
purchases
from
iran
the
iranian
rial
has
plunged
in
value
this
year
and
oil
exports
are
expected
to
continue
to
decline
without
the
benefits
of
the
nuclear
deal
iran
has
little
incentive
to
remain
in
the
accord
and
may
eventually
bow
mindful
of
the
urgency
and
the
need
for
tangible
results
the
participants
welcomed
practical
proposals
to
maintain
and
develop
payment
channels
notably
the
initiative
to
establish
a
special
purpose
vehicle
spv
to
facilitate
payments
related
to
iran
exports
including
oil
britain
china
france
germany
russia
and
the
eu
announced
in
a
joint
statement
the
goal
is
to
protect
the
freedom
of
their
economic
operators
to
pursue
legitimate
business
with
the
eu
s
plan
consists
of
an
entity
setup
for
the
sole
purpose
of
processing
payments
for
companies
doing
business
with
iran
this
would
allow
european
companies
to
buy
oil
from
iran
without
fear
of
getting
hit
by
sanctions
the
trade
would
presumably
take
place
in
a
currency
other
than
the
greenback
because
of
sanctions
on
dollar
transactions
related
opec
imo
rules
will
boost
oil
demand
by
bpdto
be
sure
the
still
wields
unparalleled
power
over
the
fate
of
iran
s
oil
exports
and
has
already
succeeded
in
disrupting
a
larger
share
of
iranian
supply
than
most
analysts
had
predicted
estimates
from
earlier
this
year
pegged
iran
s
losses
at
around
bpd
but
more
recent
estimates
put
the
losses
at
million
barrels
per
day
or
perhaps
even
more
by
the
end
of
the
year
iran
s
oil
exports
fell
to
in
august
down
bpd
from
a
month
ability
of
the
to
demand
compliance
from
so
many
countries
is
a
testament
to
the
power
of
the
international
financial
system
and
the
strength
of
the
dollar
as
the
world
s
reserve
currency
still
there
are
those
that
believe
the
aggressive
use
of
sanctions
will
backfire
on
the
dollar
in
the
long
run
in
the
future
the
effort
by
the
nations
to
setup
an
alternative
payments
system
may
be
viewed
as
a
turning
point
a
small
but
highly
symbolic
attempt
at
undermining
dollar
the
short
run
it
is
unclear
if
the
effort
will
have
an
impact
the
question
is
whether
this
will
work
because
of
course
the
us
will
continue
to
exert
colossal
pressure
on
the
european
union
and
with
a
strong
desire
can
easily
trample
down
any
mechanism
vladimir
yermakov
director
of
the
department
for
and
arms
control
at
the
russian
foreign
ministry
told
reporters
according
to
the
everything
depends
on
how
far
the
americans
want
to
go
and
how
far
our
european
colleagues
will
allow
them

is
not
clear
that
european
companies
will
be
convinced
to
trust
the
special
purpose
vehicle
setup
by
the
eu
or
that
buying
iranian
oil
will
go
unpunished

total

withdrawn

project
in
iran
and
other
major
european
companies
such
as
peugeot
renault
and
siemens
have
also
suspended
their
iranian
operations
there
is
little
prospect
of
their

europe
have
dramatically
cut
their
imports
of
iranian
oil
which
has
been
an
important
factor
in
the
decline
of
iran
s
oil
exports
that
also
seems
unlikely
to
the
decisions
by
individual
private
companies

continue
to
do
business
with

could
be
