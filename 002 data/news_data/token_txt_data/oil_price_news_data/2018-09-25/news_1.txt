opec's no.4 vows to boost spare oil capacity
opec
and
allies
snubbed
calls
from
president
donald
trump
to
lower
oil
prices
saying
on
sunday
that
they
are
satisfied
with
the
overall
healthy
balance
between
supply
and
the
key
ministers
of
the
deal
participants
however
assured
reporters
and
the
market
that
their
respective
countries
have
spare
oil
production
capacity
to
meet
demand
by
customers
if
need
key
message
from
the
energy
ministers
of
saudi
arabia
russia
and
the
united
arab
emirates
uae
was
that
if
demand
calls
for
higher
production
they
would
be
ready
to
respond
but
right
now
the
oil
market
is
fairly
balanced
and
opec
and
friends
won
t
rush
to
supply
more
oil
than
its
customers
want
and
need
as
they
are
careful
not
to
tip
the
market
into
oversupply
that
would
chip
away
at
their
oil
revenues
once
didn
t
decide
to
immediately
boost
oil
production
in
this
balanced
market
as
they
view
it
questions
remain
as
to
how
much
spare
capacity
that
saudi
arabia
the
uae
and
russia
can
bring
online
in
case
the
market
significantly
tightens
in
november
when
sanctions
on
iran
snap
back
and
venezuela
s
production
drops
to
new
uae
is
planning
to
boost
its
total
oil
production
capacity
to
million
bpd
by
the
end
of
this
year
the
emirates
energy
minister
suhail
told
s
p
global
platts
in
an
interview
after
the
panel
met
on
sunday
to
discuss
the
state
of
the
s
producer
after
saudi
arabia
iraq
and
produces
just
below
million
bpd
at
million

in
august
its
oil
production
increased
by
bpd
from
july
according
to
opec
s
secondary
uae
is
also
investing
in
additional
crude
oil
storage
told
platts
but
noted
that
the
country
would
not
overproduce
instead
it
would
lift
its
production
only
if
there
is
demand
for
such
uae
and
other
countries
are
not
worried
about
market
instability
if
they
have
spare
capacity
the
minister
said
adding
that
his
country
would
invest
some
us
billion
in
upstream
projects
over
the
next
four
to
five
the
spare
capacity
of
some
opec
members
we
are
not
going
to
come
back
and
significantly
oversupply
the
market
and
create
that
imbalance
again
told
cnbc
on
the
sidelines
of
the
panel
meeting
on
sunday
according
to
the
plans
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
uae
will
have
a
spare
production
capacity
of
bpd
which
estimates
by
platts
show
would
be
the
after

the

bring
a
couple
of

thousand

in
the

term
by
december
this
year
russian
energy
minister
alexander

told
bloomberg
in
an
interview
this
the
participants
in
the
deal
will
look
first
into
demand
before
making
any
additional
decisions
on
supply
said
novak
who
also
noted
that
the
market
may
be
in
a
small
deficit
but
overall
saudi
holds
the
world
s
largest
spare
oil
production
that
it
would
boost
oil
production
over
the
next
three
months
because
it
expects
demand
to
be
saudis
claim
that
their
spare
production
capacity
is
between
million
bpd
and
million
bpd
the
problem
with
this
estimate
is
that
it
has
never
been
arabia
s
high
oil
production
is
million
bpd
achieved
in
november
just
before
the
deal
entered
into
force
in
august
the
saudis
pumped
million
bpd
as
per
opec
secondary
sources
eia
defines
spare
capacity
as
the
volume
of
oil
production
that
can
be
brought
online
within
days
and
sustained
for
at
least
days
related
what
will
trigger
the
next
oil
price
crash
according
to
the
international
energy
agency
iea
estimates
opec
countries
have
a
combined
million
bpd
of
spare
production
capacity
of
which
percent
is
in
saudi
but
the
point
about
spare
capacity
is
that
having
been
idle
it
is
not
clear
exactly
how
much
beyond
what
is
widely
thought
to
be
easy
to
bring
online
will
be
available
to
coincide
with
further
falls
in
venezuelan
exports
and
a
maximisation
of
iranian
sanctions
the
iea
said
in
its
latest
monthly
oil
market
market
is
tightening
and
it
s
expected
to
further
tighten
by
the
end
of
the
year
thanks
to
iran
and
venezuela
but
opec
and
russia
are
not
rushing
to
tap
into
spare
capacity
because
leaving
it
tight
could
raise
the
risk
of
a
spike
in
oil
prices
in
case
of
another
