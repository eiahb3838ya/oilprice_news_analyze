has iran started to switch off oil tanker tracking systems?
with
sanctions
on
iran
s
oil
exports
just
six
weeks
away
at
least
ten
iranian
oil
supertankers
have
gone
dark
not
having
broadcast
any
signal
for
at
least
a
week
tanker
tracking
data
compiled
by
bloomberg
shows
suggesting
that
tehran
may
have
resurrected
the
old
unconventional
tactic
to
conceal
its
crude
oil
shipments
by
switching
off
transponders
on
iran
is
deploying
this
tactic
tanker
tracking
data
of
iranian
oil
exports
may
become
less
and
less
reliable
as
the
starting
date
for
the
sanctions
on
tehran
s
oil
approaches
satellites
and
shore
stations
haven
t
received
any
signals
from
the
ten
very
large
crude
carriers
vlcc
each
capable
of
transporting
up
to
million
barrels
of
oil
for
at
least
seven
days
according
to
bloomberg
data
according
to
the
data
seven
of
those
vessels
when
last
seen
were
carrying
a
total
of
million
barrels
of
crude
oil
and
condensate
the
oil
that
iran
pumps
from
its
natural
gas
fields
the
last
known
location
of
most
of
the
tankers
is
in
the
persian
to
bloomberg
while
the
loss
of
signals
from
tankers
can
be
attributed
to
seasonal
weather
conditions
disruptions
from
atmospheric
conditions
are
typically
much
shorter
once
the
tankers
leave
the
persian
gulf
they
should
have
shown

satellite
tracking
systems
if
they
have
their
tracking
systems

s
crucial

chokepointanalysts
are
facing
two
major
headwinds
in
their
estimation
of
how
low
iranian
oil
exports
could
sink
one
is
how

china

when
the

is
the
concern
that
tanker
tracking
data
may
become
increasingly
unreliable
as
iran
could
use
unconventional
methods
of
keeping
its
oil
sales
on
track
