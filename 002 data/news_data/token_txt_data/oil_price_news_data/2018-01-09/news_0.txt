soaring indian oil demand grabs opecâ€™s attention
last
week
we
discussed
changing
trends
in
iraqi
crude
flows
into
asia
total
deliveries
of
opec
crude
to
china
rose
last
year
by
bpd
as
cartel
members
looked
to
keep
one
of
its
key
growth
markets
well
though
iraqi
deliveries
into
china
reached
the
highest
on
our
records
in
november
at
a
million
barrels
per
day
arrivals
in
were
actually
down
versus
the
prior
year
as
iraq
shifted
its
focus
towards
india
and
the
instead
while
iraqi
deliveries
to
china
edged
lower
versus
volumes
other
cartel
members
such
as
angola
venezuela
kuwait
and
libya
all
saw
flows
increase
angola
and
venezuela
led
the
charge
in
terms
of
higher
deliveries
as
both
nations
continue
to
service
their
debts
with
china
via
oil
as
opposed
to
cash
a
rebound
in
libyan
production
meant
more

its
way

chinese
shores

saudi
arabia
sent
just

it

it
has
been
well
documented
that
saudi
arabia
focused
its
export
cuts
in
the
second
half
of
last
year
on
the
largest
and
most
transparent
global
market
the
where
it
felt
it
would
get
the
most
bang
for
its
buck
the
drop
in
saudi
flows
in
combination
with
lower
venezuelan
deliveries
due
to
both
lower
production
from
the
latin
american
nation
as
well
as
quality
issues
with
its
crude
has
meant
that
opec
deliveries
to
the
were
bpd
lower
last
year
than
in
that
equates
to
a
drop
of
million
barrels
countering
the
drop
in
flows
from
saudi
venezuela
and
also
kuwait
we
have
seen
stronger
arrivals
from
nigeria
and
libya
as
both
boosted
production
last
year
while
deliveries
from
iraq
rose
the
most
they
were
up
over
bpd
on
