expect a new wave of oilfield service ipos in 2018
this
time
last
year
the
oilfield
service
sector
started
showing
the
first
signs
of
hope
and
optimism
after
the
deal
to
cut
crude
oil
production
by
million
bpd
lifted
prices
to
levels
last
seen
years
the
first
five
months
of
five
oilfield
services
providers
filed
for
an
initial
public
offering
overtaking
exploration
and
production
listings
by
a
wide
margin
signaling
returning
optimism
in
the
sector
thanks
to
improved
oil
prices
the
value
of
the
five
listings
was
also
impressive
at
billion
it
surpassed
the
total
raised
through
listings
in
when
oil
was
trading
at
almost
a
barrel
and
yet
some
of
the
listings
flopped
with
the
companies
trading
much
lower
than
their
issue
prices
are
even
higher
than
they
were
at
the
beginning
of
there
is
much
stronger
demand
for
fracking
and
maintenance
services
and
two
companies
that
last
year
postponed
plans
for
an
ipo
are
now
preparing
to
try
again
one
other
fracking
services
provider
liberty
oilfield
services
took
the
plunge
and
early
this
month
announced
the
terms
of
its
ipo
planning
to
offer
million
shares
and
eyeing
proceeds
of
up
to
other
two
still
standing
on
the
springboard
are
fts
international
and
nine
energy
service
reuters
notes
in
a
recent
story
that
late
last
year
both
fts
and
nine
energy
amended
the
terms
of
their
initial
filings
leading
analysts
to
suggest
that
they
may
be
preparing
to
give
listing
another
try
despite
last
year
s
lukewarm
interest
from
investors
that
led
nine
energy
and
another
ipo
hopeful
bj

to
shelve
their
listing
plans
at
the
time
last

eyed
proceeds
of

planned
to
pocket

will
talk

prices
down
if
brent
tops
the
time
the
problem
seemed
to
be
that
that
investors
were
uncertain
about
returns
as
one
oil
analyst
told
bloomberg
s
alex
barinka
in
may
oilfield
services
is
a
very
general
term
that
includes
a
wide
variety
of
different
things
from
fracking
to
sand
and
water
supply
it
s
difficult
to
navigate
the
complex
landscape
so
investors
are
staying
with
the
big
names
which
just
became
bigger
after
ge
s
takeover
of
baker
hughes
according
to
rob
thummel
the
newcomers
on
the
capital
market
would
need
to
convince
potential
investors
that
there
is
something
that
distinguishes
them
from
the
s
latest
energy
outlook
could
help
with
investor
sentiment
the
authority
has
forecast
that
crude
oil
production
will
hit
its
highest
average
daily
in
history
this
year
at
million
barrels
and
it
only
continue
to
grow
from
there
eventually
reaching
million
bpd
in
late
this
will
need
a
lot
of
wells
drilled
and
fracked
and
that
s
where
the
independents
could
come
only
risk
is
of
course
the
oil
price
for
now
the
going
is
good
with
brent
almost
touching
a
barrel
and
wti
firmly
climbing
towards
a
barrel
so
drillers
can
afford
the
now
much
more
expensive
services
of
nine
energy
bj
services
and
their
likes
but
how
long
will
the
good
going
keep
saudi
arabia
and
russia
are
no
doubt
watching
shale
developments
like
hawks
biding
their
time
to
pick
the
best
moment
to
exit
the
production
cut
deal
certainly
neither
of
them
would
be
particularly
happy
when
prices
they
they
might
decide
to
risk
this
instead
of
having
the
produce
million
barrels
daily
without
doing
something
about
it
