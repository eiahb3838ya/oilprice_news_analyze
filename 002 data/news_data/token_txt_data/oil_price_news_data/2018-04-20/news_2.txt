renewables are booming in oil country
the
rapid
growth
of
the
renewable
energy
sector
has
been
have
been
the
sources
of
energy
worldwide
and
we
re
seeing
solar
power
coming
in
first
as
the
source
companies
in
particular
have
been
embracing
this
renewable
revolution
but
it
s
not
just
silicon
valley
that
s
heading
into
this
businesses
like
starbucks
and
target
have
been
getting
in
on
it
as
well
who
have
each
announced
aggressive
targets
to
run
percent
of
its
global
operations
with
renewable
the
midst
of
an
energy
revolution
like
this
one
it
s
easy
to
miss
the
subtleties
involved
in
making
it
there
is
one
simple
reason
as
to
why
renewables
are
in
oil
territory
renewables
are
boomingboth
solar
and
wind
continue
to
decline
in
operating
costs
while
increasing
in
energy
efficiency
the
combination
is
making
it
difficult
for
coal
to
recover
and
poses
a
challenge
in
what
had
been
west
texas
for
permian
basin
which
straddles
texas
and
new
mexico
continues
to
be
one
of
the
most
prolific
drilling
locations
in
the
operating
costs
as
compared
to
wellhead
prices
the
price
producers
actually
receive
for
the
volume
coming
out
of
the
ground
make
for
some
profitable
fields
even
at
low
oil
the
same
location
has
also
become
the
largest
in
the
country
for
wind
is
even
this
deep
in
oil
country
texas
produces
more
wind
energy
than
the
next
three
states
is
saudi
arabia
losing
its
asian
oil
market
share
currently
the
lone
star
state
accounts
for
nearly
a
fourth
of
the
nation
s
wind
power
capacity
and
current
wind
projects
have
the
capacity
to
generate
over
megawatts
mw
of
s
enough
to
power
more
than
million
both
solar
and
wind
the
assumption
not
long
ago
was
that
once
government
subsidies
had
been
phased
out
a
ceiling
would
form
on
additional
renewable
power
this
argument
in
favor
of
a
return
to
dominance
for
traditional
energy
sources
failed
to
consider
one
salient
cheaper
energy
sourcesolar
and
wind
have
become
far
cheaper
to
produce
than
even
their
strongest
adherents
had
expected
that
means
they
have
both
reached
and
exceeded
grid
parity
their
generating
costs
being
equal
or
lower
than
those
of
natural
gas
and
even
nuclear
remains
the
cheapest
way
to
produce
the
high
costs
of
constructing
nuclear
power
plants
and
the
still
long
delays
in
approval
and
finishing
the
plants
have
propelled
renewables
into
an
ascendancy
in
the
fuel
oil
hardly
figures
into
the
equation
in
the
until
the
next
massive
wave
switch
in
vehicle
engines
electric
hybrid
cng
compressed
natural
gas
and
lng
liquefied
natural
gas
distillates
gasoline
and
diesel
will
have
the
lion
share
of
the
transport
fuel
means
that
on
the
electricity
production
front
this
has
become
a
competition
between
coal
and
natural
gas
on
the
one
hand
and
renewables
solar
and
wind
with
a
marginal
presence
of
biofuel
and
geothermal
on
the
natural
gas
production
in
the
would
seem
to
have
been
given
a
boost
by
the
trump
administration
s
support
for
hydrocarbons
the
problem
has
been
a
persistent
surplus
of
production
combined
with
a
penchant
by
mother
nature
to
produce
mellower
than
expected
temperatures
which
drives
down
air
conditioning
use
and
thus
power
can
saudi
arabia
afford
its
megaprojects
the
latter
is
likely
to
change
as
we
move
into
summer
and
hotter
the
bottom
line
remains
the
new
energy
powerhouse
is
heresolar
and
wind
have
become
far
more
competitive
and
have
in
some
cases
west
texas
wind
and
the
southwest
solar
for
example
emerged
as
the
preferable
of
which
has
set
the
stage
for
a
very
different
scenario
following
the
decision
to
make
the
one
of
only
three
nations
opposed
to
the
paris
climate
then
that
number
is
misleading
since
nicaragua
largely
opposes
the
agreement
because
it
did
not
go
far
enough
in
combatting
climate
leaves
just
the
and
syria
of
all
here
is
the
interesting
the
elimination
of
government
support
and
new
management
at
the
environmental
protection
agency
epa
bent
on
resurrecting
coal
solar
and
wind
continue
to
undercut
the
cost
of
increasing
reliance
on
simply
renewables
are
progressively
becoming
the
energy
currency
of
choice
regardless
of
what
exercise
in
political
dominoes
the
administration
had
in
consider
and
wind
employees
total
nearly
in
the
domestic
workforce
a
figure
likely
to
be
doubled
by
coal
jobs
have
dwindled
to
less
than
a
quarter
as
the
renewable
energy
sector
and
will
decline
even
further
by
the
end
of
the
of
the
electoral
machinations
practiced
in
the
white
house
the
market
itself
is
making
its
own
there
will
remain
a
position
for
coal
in
the
developing
energy
balance
