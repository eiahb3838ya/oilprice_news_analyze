the $50 billion deal that could revive the aramco ipo
the
aramco
ipo
saga
continues
with
the
saudi
oil
giant
soon
to
enter
the
international
financial
markets
for
a
billion
sources
are
reporting
that
the
world
s
largest
oil
company
will
look
for
around
billion
from
international
banks
largely
to
be
used
to
finance
a
majority
stake
in
saudi
basic
industries
corporation
sabic
banks
have
been
approached
by
aramco
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
as
the
oil
giant
is
looking
to
acquire
a
majority
stake
currently
held
by
the
saudi
sovereign
wealth
fund
public
investment
fund
pif
holds
a
market
value
of
around
billion
at
present
the
saudi
pif
holds
a
percent
stake
in
sabic
which
would
mean
that
aramco
would
need
to
finance
the
rest
from
its
own
reserves
which
are
an
estimated
billion
the
statements
come
just
shortly
after
aramco
s
ceo
amin
nasser
reiterated
that
his
company
is
still
committed
to
the
is
still
not
clear
when
the
financing
is
going
to
take
place
but
financial
sources
expect
that
it
will
be
end
of
or
beginning
of
saudi
sources
have
stated
that
no
banks
have
been
mandated
for
the
financial
package
deal
even
though
banks
jp
morgan
and
morgan
stanley
have
been
asked
to
advise
on
the
acquisition
in
addition
to
its
cash
holdings
which
have
increased
substantially
in
the
last
couple
of
months
aramco
is
slated
to
be
looking
at
a
combination
of
a
large
syndicated
loan
and
bridge
loans
that
would
be
replaced
after
about
to
months
with
bond
issues
for
the
the
media
has
already
reported
saudi
arabia
is
sure
to
try
and
set
up
the
deal
via
bonds
as
it
is
looking
to
expand
its
bond
market
international
interest
is
already
growing
but
could
be
given
a
boost
by
the
new
deal
it
remains
unclear
how
far
aramco
will
be
able
to
put
an
international
bond
sale
in
place
as
such
a
deal
would
require
a
credit
rating
and
necessitate
the
disclosure
of
financial
information
in
a
prospectus
these
details
have
until
now
been
very
hard
to
obtain
as
the
company
and
the
kingdom
are
very
wary
of
divulging
it
to
the
press
or
international
investors

billion

might
never
happenat
the
same
time
as
we
all
know
the
aramco
ipo
proposal
has
been
put
on
hold
due
to
transparency
and
data
information
issues
hence
the
eagerness
by
aramco
and
its
stakeholders
aka
the
royal
family
to
approach
the
deal
as
a
normal
bank
loan
for
international
banks
the
billion
loan
might
not
be
very
tempting
as
aramco
could
be
pricing
its
debt
on
a
par
with
the
government
demanding
reality
however
is
sure
to
be
different
when
asked
by
aramco
the
majority
of
international
banks
will
be
more
than
willing
to
issue
the
loan
the
opportunity
to
have
the
world
s
largest
oil
company
on
your
list
of
clients
is
tempting
banks
know
that
taking
part
in
this
may
be
a
commercially
less
interesting
loan
but
future
mandates
for
capital
market
transactions
will
be
up
for
grabs

the

not

it

is
a
