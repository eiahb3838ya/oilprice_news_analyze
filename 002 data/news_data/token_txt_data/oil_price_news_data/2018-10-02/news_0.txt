wti discount to brent could explode
the
world
s
two
most
important
oil
benchmarks
are
on
two
different
tracks
and
may
see
a
larger
divergence
in
the
months
has
typically
traded
at
a
discount
to
brent
although
the
differential
widens
and
narrows
depending
on
specific
dynamics
affecting
the
two
benchmarks
back
in
when
the
shale
bonanza
really
began
to
explode
the
midstream
sector
was
for
such
a
dramatic
ramp
up
the
result
was
a
bottleneck
that
forced
wti
to
trade
at
a
discount
in
excess
of
per
barrel
for
a
short
period
of
time
new
pipelines
resolved
the
backlog
and
the
discount
narrowed
in
the
ensuing
however
surging
production
in
the
permian
has
resulted
in
yet
another
midstream
bottleneck
as
a
result
the
wti
discount
has
bounced
around
between
and
per
barrel
relative
to
brent
in
september
the
differential
jumped
to
click
to
enlarge
in
fact
the
two
benchmarks
may
very
well
continue
to
diverge
in
the
months
ahead
as
they
experience
different
market
shale
output
continues
to
grow
albeit
at
a
slower
pace
than
in
months
past
permian
takeaway
capacity
is
all
but
tapped
out
which
could
result
in
localized
glut
of
supply
oil
located
in
midland
texas
in
the
heart
of
the
permian
has
already
been
trading
at
a
discount
to
wti
in
houston
and
that
dynamic
will
only
magnify
as
we
head
into
brent
which
more
closely
reflects
the
international
market
is
suffering
from
the
opposite
problem
as
iranian
supply
continues
to
plunge
iranian
oil
exports
are
down
some
million
barrels
per
day
from
the
april
peak
the
global
oil
market
has
tightened
to
its
greatest
extent
since
now
there
are
questions
about
saudi
arabia
s
spare
capacity
and
its
ability
to
offset
the
outages
in
result
is
that
wti
and
brent
are
on
diverging
paths
which
could
widen
the
differential
to
as
much
as
per
barrel
according
to
citigroup
roughly
twice
as
high
as
today
as
permian
production
continues
to
grind
higher
more
oil
could
end
up
in
storage
in
cushing
as
inventories
climb
wti
will
suffer
downward
pressure

underwhelming

price
rally
as
production
grows
the
likelihood
is
overwhelming
that
a
lot
of
the
valves
to
get
into
the
gulf
coast
are
going
to
close
morse
said
in
a
bloomberg
interview
during
the
asia
pacific
petroleum
conference
appec
in
singapore
last
week
it
s
bottlenecked
getting
to
the
gulf
coast
but
it
s
not
as
bottlenecked
getting
into
that
could
result
in
the
widest
discount
in
about
five
years
we
expect
that
permian
production
is
going
to
continue
to
grow
morse
said
we
have
production
from
colorado
to
oklahoma
even
from
north
dakota
and
canada
that
has
to
go
to
cushing
before
getting
to
the
gulf
a
differential
as
large
as
per
barrel
would
have
knock
on
effects
it
would
supercharge
the
business
case
for
new
pipelines
coming
out
of
the
permian
although
some
analysts
think
that
the
midstream
market
in
texas
is
getting
pretty
crowded
with
several
pipelines
under
construction
such
a
heavy
discount
could
also
incrementally
slow
drilling
in
the
shale
patch
at
the
same
time
new
modes
of
transit
could
open
up
with
an
expansion
of
trucks
and
rail
moving
oil
from
west
texas
to
the
gulf
coast
although
trucks
and
rail
are
also
facing
their
own
constraints
more
obvious
effect
of
a
discount
for
wti
would
be
an
acceleration
of
crude
oil
exports
crude
discounted
by
that
much
would
be
very
attractive
to
buyers
around
the
world
so
exports
would
likely
rise
even
higher
than
today
s
levels
if
wti
were
discounted
by
per
barrel
relative
to
brent
the
limiting
factor
for
exports
would
be
inadequate
export
infrastructure
not
willing
buyers
related
how
much
spare
capacity
does
saudi
arabia
really
have
gulf
coast
refiners
would
also
enjoy
buying
up
crude
and
churning
out
gasoline
and
diesel
which
they
could
export
at
much
higher
prices
that
are
more
closely
linked
with
brent
even
better
refiners
inland
would
have
a
better
chance
of
buying
the
heavily
discounted
oil
trapped
behind
the
pipeline
wti
may
be
discounted
to
brent
by
per
barrel
but
midland
crude
would
be
discounted
by
at
least
as
much
relative
to
wti
in
houston
the
result
would
be
a
windfall
for
this
is
a
temporary
story
there
are
several
reasons
why
the
discount
would
not
last
long
the
biggest
and
most
obvious
reason
is
that
the
permian
pipeline
bottleneck
is
expected
to
be
fleeting
by
late
next
year
new
capacity
will
start
coming
online
to
ease
the
backlog
that
will
allow
more
oil
to
reach
the
gulf
coast
either
for
refining
or
for
export
narrowing
the
price
second
reason
would
be
that
a
surge
in
exports
would
help
force
wti
and
brent
back
together
although
the
degree
to
which
this
matters
is
up
for
debate
more
crude
oil
exports
will
help
even
out
the
imbalances
in
what
are
essentially
different
markets
for
crude
oil
just
as
any
arbitrage
