who gets hold of russiaâ€™s key oil hub?
one
of
russia
s
most
important
oil
ports
the
sunlit
novorossiysk
has
become
a
battleground
for
the
country
companies
located
in
the
tsemesskaya
bay
novorossiysk
is
used
to
stormy
springs
because
of
the
northeasterm
wind
blowing
powerfully
sometimes
to
the
point
that
port
operations
have
to
stop
for
a
few
days
yet
this
spring
turned
out
to
be
stormier
than
usual
one
of
novorossiysk
s
main
owners
the
privately
owned
summa
group
of
brothers
ziyavudin
and
magomed
magomedov
will
be
forced
to
sell
their
stake
in
the
company
in
light
of
their
arrest
and
impending
ascent
of
the
summa
group
was
as
swift
as
will
be
judging
by
the
ongoing
process
its
downfall
the
company
jointly
bought
percent
of
the
novorossiysk
port
with
the
transneft
for
billion
roughly
percent
higher
than
its
market
price
at
that
time
palpably
backed
by
medvedev
whose
government
chief
of
staff
at
that
time
was
arkadiy
dvorkovich
former
university
classmate
and
close
friend
of
ziyavudin
magomedov
the
connection
does
not
end
there
dvorkovich
s
wife
is
of
dagestani
descent
just
as
the
magomedovs
all
in
all
such
a
beneficial
state
of
affairs
allowed
summa
group
to
build
up
a
sprawling
portfolio
and
become
a
leading
voice
on
the
russian
port
infrastructure
the
march
arrest
of
the
magomedovs
ziyavudin
was
arrested
for
having
set
up
a
crime
network
as
well
as
on
embezzlement
and
fraud
charges
his
brother
was
allegedly
responsible
for
the
coercive
of
their
dealings
it
is
very
unlikely
that
magomedov
on
the
russian
forbes
list
will
be
freed
from
charges
arrests
in
russia
are
chaotic
yet
the
authorities
would
not
risk
fabricating
charges
given
the
already
difficult
situation
business
works
in
russia
moreover
one
of
the
main
charges
consists
in
the
illegal
appropriation
of
money
allocated
for
the
construction
of
the
kaliningrad
football
arena
where
several
world
cup
matches
will
be
held
the
public
at
large
will
rather
side
by
the
federal
authorities
than
the
the
oil
giant
that
saw
its
cash
reserves
plunge
thus
percent
of
the
novorossiysk
commercial
sea
port
ncsp
is
up
for
grabs
summa
s
partner
in
the
percent
majority
owner
novoport
holding
is
the
pipeline
transportation
monopoly
transneft
which
owns
another
percent
of
the
asset
via
its
transneft
service
subsidiary
the
remaining
shares
belong
to
the
federal
property
management
agency
percent
russian
railways
percent
and
are
on
the
moscow
and
london
stock
exchanges
percent
if
transneft
were
to
scoop
up
this
stake
it
would
establish
itself
as
a
dominant
player
in
the
black
sea
infrastructure
controlling
percent
of
the
dominant
port
in
the
region
most
observers
thought
this
was
inevitable
transneft
has
declared
interest
in
the
asset
moreover
it
has
consolidated
its
footing
in
the
ncsp
after
summa
representatives
were
ousted
from
the
executive
board
and
were
replaced
by
transneft
s
takeover
of
novorossiysk
would
make
sense
from
the
point
of
view
of
russian
authorities
for
them
a
oil
transportation
giant
is
easier
to
control
than
a
private
entity
yet
as
has
become
sadly
traditional
in
russia
a
sudden
twist
has
complicated
matters
for
all
rumours
have
started
circulating
that
rosneft
is
willing
to
buy
summa
s
shares
although
the
company
itself
has
warned
against
any
provocations
and
disinformation
in
regard
to
rosneft
and
partly
denied
having
interest
in
the
port
the
phrasing
was
peculiar
as
the
press
statement
said
rosneft
is
not
interested
from
buying
an
asset
from
someone
under
investigation
if
the
state
nationalized
the
percent
would
it
become
interested
oddly
enough
federal
public
servants
have
been
keeping
the
rosneft
claim
head
of
the
federal
office
igor
artemiev
claimed
rosneft
might
move
to
get
its
share
of
the
port
because
it
needs
its
infrastructure
to
avoid
being
plundered
perhaps
it
is
just
a
way
to
play
it
safe
after
rosneft
swallowed
up
bashneft
in
late
and
carried
out
a
rather
quaint
partial
privatization
involving
cefc
the
chinese
conglomerate
that
is
now
on
the
brink
of
going
bust
it
became
an
omnipresent
actor
on
the
russian
oil
market
yet
a
potential
coexistence
of
rosneft
and
transneft
within
one
holding
company
is
ripe
with
controversies
just
in
the
past
few
years
there
were
several
judicial
proceedings
between
the
two
most
notably
in
late
rosneft
refused
to
sign
up
to
transneft
s
annual
transportation
contract
accusing
it
of
excessive
pipeline
transportation
process
losses
allegedly
up
to
mtpa
the
conflict
was
solved
only
after
minister
of
energy
novak
intervened

biggest

instabilityeven
though
this
year
brought
no
scandals
it
has
still
been
replete
with
rows
late
february
transneft
accused
the
novorossiysk
port
master
of
prioritizing
rosneft
s
shipping
interests
because
of
which
several
vessels
with
fixtures
before
that
of
rosneft
were
forced
to
stand
idle
for
days
outside
of
novorossiysk
if
the
ncsp
s
ownership
structure
were
to
become
another
battlefield
between
the
two
things
would
most
certainly
get
nastier
than
this
the
vector
of
russian
political
power
has
largely
boiled
down
to
keeping
close
confidants
equidistant
and
satisfied
with
their
status
all
the
while
avoiding
nasty
infighting
yet
if
one
is
to
look
at
the
interests
of
novorossiysk
itself
it
is
very
likely
that
its
consolidation
under
a
transneft
umbrella
might
do
a
lot
of
good
to

black

novorossiysk
is
no
longer
the
leading
crude
export
outlet
in
the
black
sea
having
been
overtaken
by
the
caspian
pipeline
consortium
whose
throughput
will
skyrocket
to
mtpa
this
year
in
the
last
years
novorossiysk
crude
exports
have
fallen
by
percent
even
though
other
commodities
such
as
grain
have
demonstrated
robust
growth
therefore
although
it
seems
counterintuitive
for
a
private
company
to
be
bought
up
by
a
federal
one
in
today
s
russia
it
might
help
by
easing
financial
constraints
on
the
development
of
the
port
due
to
a
steady
influx
of
money
from
the
mother
company
s
pipeline
transportation
business
and
bringing
sudden
direction
switches
to
a
minimum
it
seems
certainly
better
