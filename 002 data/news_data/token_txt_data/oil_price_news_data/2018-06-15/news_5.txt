u.s. shale, opec to discuss market balance in vienna
as
everyone
watches
opec
and
russia
ahead
of
their
meeting
in
vienna
next
week
it
s
easy
to
miss
the
fact
that
this
is
not
the
only
meeting
that
will
set
the
course
of
the
global
oil
market
in
the
coming
months
opec
officials
will
also
meet
with
chief
executives
from
the
shale
industry
in
vienna
with
continental

harold
hamm
hess
corp
s
john
hess
and
pioneer
s
scott
sheffield
among
those
to
address
opec
reuters
none
of
the
executives
were
willing
to
comment
on
the
meeting
ahead
of
it
the
topic
of
discussion
will
be
cooperation
after
the
last
price
crisis
revealed
that
the
only
way
to
achieve
a
balance
between
crude
oil
demand
and
supply
is
to
work
together
rather
than
against
each
fact
that
has
brought
shale
producers
and
opec
closer
together
is
that
production
is
no
longer
priority
we
re
getting
to
a
point
where
a
continued
rise
in
the
oil
price
is
going
to
cause
major
problems
for
the
global
economy
reuters
quoted
the
council
on
foreign
relations
energy
security
and
climate
change
program
director
amy
meyers
jaffe
as
saying
there
are
bigger
issues
at
hand
besides
output
that
opec
and
shale
producers
care
related
saudi
arabia
deal
to
gradually
ease
cuts
is
inevitable
one
of
these
bigger
issues
is
the
increase
price
elasticity
of
oil
a
couple
of
decades
ago
fossil
fuels
had
no
real
alternatives
now
there
are
solar
power
plants
and
electric
cars
as
we
saw
from
the
last
oil
price
rally
consumers
are
no
longer
willing
to
pay
more
to
get
increasing
amounts
of
oil
they
often
seek
alternatives
and
can
find
them
relatively
to
analysts
the
top
priority
for
shale
producers
now
is
not
oil
s
stable
prices
although
they
can
not
legally
coordinate
production
to
achieve
these
stable
prices
the
can
discuss
the
situation
and
the
future
prospects
of
the
global
industry
with
opec
what
will
come
out
of
these
discussions
remains
to
