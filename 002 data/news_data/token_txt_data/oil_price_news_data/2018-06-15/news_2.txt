venezuela forced to shut down production as operations fall apart
every
week
the
crisis
in
venezuela
takes
a
turn
for
the
are
now
signs
that
its
oil
industry
is
entering
a
dangerous
new
phase
argus
media
reports
that
venezuela
has
begun
to
proactively
shut
in
oil
production
to
cope
with
nearly
replete
terminal
storage
further
accelerating
an
output
decline
and
bringing
the
opec
country
closer
to
the
psychological
barrier
of
venezuela
s
oil
production
fell
to
an
average
of
million
barrels
per
day
in
may
down
another
bpd
from
a
month
earlier
according
to
opec
s
secondary
sources
however
with
the
crisis
in
venezuela
spiraling
out
of
control
at
a
horrific
pace
the
numbers
from
may
might
as
well
be
a
year
may
numbers
don
t
reflect
the
full
ramifications
of
having
to
deal
with
inadequate
port
capacity
after
pdvsa
diverted
operations
to
venezuela
from
its
caribbean
island
refineries
and
storage
facilities
following
the
attempt
by
conocophillips
to
take
control
of
problem
of
export
capacity
has
become
so
acute
that
pdvsa
is
demanding
customers
send
ships
that
can
handle
loadings
since
there
is
a
backlog
of
ships
trying
to
load
up
at
the
country
s
decrepit
ports
pdvsa
is
even
considering
declaring
force
majeure
on
contracts
that
it
will
be
unable
to
fulfill
the
upshot
is
that
pdvsa
might
have
only
bpd
available
for
export
in
june
which
is
less
than
half
of
the
that
it
is
contractually
obligated
to
deliver
this
month
related
venezuela
won
t
have
enough
oil
to
export
by
such
the
figure
for
may
bad
as
it
is
is
woefully
out
of
date
sources
told
argus
media
that
production
plunged
to
just
in
early
june
heading
down
towards
be
sure
upstream
operations
are
in
crisis
mode
but
the
bottlenecks
at
storage
facilities
and
the
ports
have
opened
up
a
whole
new
eastern
division
storage
of
bl
is
at
full
capacity
and
western
division
storage
capacity
of
almost
bl
will
be
filled
to
its
operational
capacity
in
a
question
of
days
the
western
division
executive
told
argus
pdvsa
s
terminals
and
facilities
equipped
to
handle
million
barrels
are
filled
nearly
to
capacity
an
oil
ministry
official
storage
and
exporting
problem
is
having
a
ripple
effect
upstream
pdvsa
and
its
partners
have
halted
operations
at
two
upgraders
that
process
heavy
oil
and
two
more
facilities
could
be
shutdown
according
to
reuters
moves
intended
to
ease
the
pressure
on
the
storage
facilities
but
if
upgraders
are
shut
down
pdvsa
won
t
be
able
to
process
heavy
oil
which
means
it
will
have
to
curtail
or
shut
down
operations
at
its
oil
have
predicted
that
venezuela
s
oil
situation
would
deteriorate
over
the
course
of
but
the
descent
is
happening
much
faster
than
most
people
predicted
if
opec
said
venezuela
produced
in
may
and
sources
from
within
the
venezuelan
oil
ministry
are
now
saying
the
country
is
producing
between
and
that
could
potentially
mean
output
falls
by
a
few
hundred
thousand
barrels
per
day
in
june
compared
to
a
month
earlier
venezuela
had
been
losing
roughly
bpd
each
month
this
year
so
the
unraveling
underway
right
now
is
a
sign
that
production
losses
are
spiraling
out
of
control
related
the
bullish
and
bearish
case
for
oilin
another
sign
of
trouble
pdvsa
announced
that
it
will
suspend
oil
shipments
to
about
half
of
the
caribbean
nations
in
the
petrocaribe
program
according
to
the
antigua
observer
the
program
inaugurated
under
the
late
hugo
chavez
offered
caribbean
nations
oil
and
refined
products
on
favorable
terms
often
including
extended
payback
periods
at
extremely
low
interest
said
it
would
cut
shipments
of
refined
products
by
about
bpd
to
eight
of
the
countries
in
the
program
amazingly
pdvsa
has
vowed
to
keep
up
some
bpd
of
shipments
to
the
other
nations
meanwhile
pdvsa
apparently
does
not
have
enough
of
the
type
of
oil
that
it
typically
sends
to
cuba
so
despite
being
essentially
broke
it
is
reportedly
trying
to
purchase
light
crude
from
third
parties
to
send
to
cuba
in
order
not
to
disrupt
shipments
to
its
is
hard
to
see
things
turning
around
anytime
soon
for
venezuela
we
assume
no
respite
in
the
production
collapse
that
has
taken
off
the
market
in
the
past
two
years
