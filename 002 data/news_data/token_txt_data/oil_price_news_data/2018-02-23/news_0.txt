should energy investors fear mexico’s 2018 elections?
within
a
few
months
mexico
will
have
a
new
president
with
the
incumbent
enrique
peña
nieto
barred
from
running
the
most
likely
winner
is
andrés
manuel
lópez
obrador
leading
his
newly
created
national
regeneration
movement
morena
to
a
victory
obrador
or
amlo
as
he
is
most
often
abbreviated
started
his
career
in
the
institutional
revolutionary
party
pri
which
dominated
mexico
s
century
politics
and
continues
to
be
a
leading
force
in
the
became
the
leading
voice
against
the
pri
and
after
two
unsuccessful
attempts
he
is
on
the
brink
of
a
breakthrough
this
is
especially
pertinent
in
view
of
mexico
s
opening
up
of
its
upstream
sector
to
foreign
investment
which
amlo
has
promised
to
wind
back
but
just
how
far
can
he
go
to
put
the
stakes
in
perspective
one
has
to
look
at
the
history
of
mexico
s
oil
industry
following
a
nationalization
of
the
entire
industry
for
years
only
the
mexican
national
oil
company
pemex
had
rights
to
develop
fields
both
onshore
and
offshore
ironically
the
same
party
pri
which
initiated
the
nationalization
in
the
past
has
pulled
the
plug
on
it
in
cognizant
that
mexico
had
significant
reserves
which
were
not
utilized
due
to
pemex
s
inability
to
cover
all
projects
duly
at
the
same
time
the
peña
nieto
administration
has
also
made
pemex
more
autonomous
in
that
it
has
done
away
with
the
burdensome
government
approval
mechanisms
notwithstanding
the
success
of
the
oil
reform
the
pri
stands
to
reasons
for
a
potential
failure
of
peña
nieto
s
successor
josé
antonio
meade
kuribreña
former
secretary
of
finance
and
public
credit
are
manifold
although
the
economy
grew
by
an
annual
percent
throughout
peña
nieto
s
tenure
its
gdp
fell
by
percent
corruption
remains
rampant
in
mexico
in
fact
it
had
permeated
the
political
classes
to
such
an
extent
that
former
pri
governors
have
been
arrested
or
investigated
on
charges
of
corruption
under
the
incumbent
president
s
watch
the
taint
reached
the
president
too
having
had
to
apologize
for
his
wife
buying
a
house
from
a
government
contractor
grupo
higa
moreover
a
plethora
of
smear
campaigns
have
backfired
for
the
ruling
pri
warnings
that
amlo
might
turn
mexico
into
another
venezuela
fell
flat
against
the
background
of
spiraling
crime
rates
more
than
murders
in
why
is
the
spread
shrinking
obrador
has
worked
hard
to
make
sure
his
bid
is
successful
the
third
time
he
toured
every
single
municipality
of
mexico
ahead
of
the
ballot
amlo
has
been
a
vocal
opponent
of
the
state
of
things
in
mexico
s
oil
sector
he
rose
to
national
prominence
as
the
defender
of
mexico
s
indigenous
people
pollution
upon
the
peña
nieto
administration
announcing
the
opening
up
of
mexico
s
upstream
amlo
promised
widespread
protests
but
a
sudden
heart
attack
prevented
him
from
staging
anything
yet
he
never
renounced
the
idea
pledging
to
roll
back
the
energy
reform
however
with
time
his
stance
became
more
subdued
he
ruled
out
authoritarian
action
on
the
issue
and
promised
to
hold
a
referendum
to
see
the
vox
should
it
matter
anyway
one
might
ask
well
because
mexico
s
shelf
remains
one
of
the
few
remaining
provinces
still
capable
of
unearthing
massive
discoveries
the
mexican
and
us
gulf
deepwater
has
been
one
of
the
rare
solid
performers
in
terms
of
new
finds
albeit
with
different
quality
parameters
the
likes
of
the
deepwater
light

maximino
recoverable
reserves
of
million
barrels
and
bcf
of
natural
gas
and
nobilis

or
the
shallower

and

or
the

utsil
field
million
barrels
and
bcf
of

all
make
part
of
the
last
years
discovery
list
in
order
to
succeed
in
developing
these
fields
in
a
timely
manner
pemex
has
expressed
its
willingness
to
farm
out
these
mexican
authorities
try
to
push
the
energy
reforms
through
before
the
new
presumed
administration
of
amlo
takes
over
after
mexico
organized
for
pemex
round
zero
whereby
the
national
company
could
bid
for
most
of
the
nation
s
proven
reserves
it
held
round
then
round
shallow
water
acreages
as
well
as
and
onshore
blocks
in
the
auctioning
did
not
end
there
this
year
mexico
already
held
its
first
deepwater
acreage
auction
round
but
also
intends
to
hold
rounds
and
in
march
and
july
distributing
remaining
shallow
water
and
onshore
blocks
correspondingly
apart
from
maximizing
the
effects
of
crude
oil
auctions
and
streamlining
procedures
the
peña
nieto
government
also
wants
to
liberalize
the
domestic
jet
market
and
have
power
supply
auctions
too
before
it
is
forced
to
leave
office
related
what
s
really
happening
with
venezuela
s
el
petro
the
latest
auction
round
exceeded
the
expectations
of
oil
market
observers
in
that
out
of
the
deepwater
blocks
offered
were
awarded
amongst
high
competition
the
government
expected
that
only
seven
will
be
distributed
this
would
translate
into
roughly
billion
in
investments
over
the
lifetime
of
the
contracts
no
wonder
this
auction
was
deemed
the
most
important
incorporating
acreages
from
the
deepwater
perdido
basin
the
mexican
ridges
as
well
as
from
royal
dutch
shell
was
particularly
aggressive
in
its
bidding
taking
up
out
of
the
blocks
followed
by
petronas
blocks
and
qatar
petroleum
to
further
emphasize
the
bids
importance
it
should
be
noted
that
the
total
production
capacity
of
the
blocks
auctioned
in
round
is
almost
equivalent
to
the
amount
of
oil
mexico
produces
currently
million
barrels
per
peña
nieto
administration
will
push
ahead
with
the
two
remaining
auctions
this
year
which
will
most
likely
result
in
similarly
high
interest
from
international
majors
the
reason
is
simple
apart
from
genuine
reserves
in
place
mexico
is
offering
competitive
e
p
terms
which
are
bound
to
worsen
as
a
more
statist
leader
is
expected
to
take
the
helm
it
is
unlikely
that
lópez
obrador
will
continue
with
acreage
auctions
therefore
it
would
be
politic
to
invest
now
for
those
who
are
interested
disentangling
the
changes
would
become
a
slow
and
increasingly
painful
process
for
amlo
for
he
needs
to
amend
the
constitution
to
reverse
the
changes
a
sisyphean
task
deepwater
despite
higher
complexity
and
bigger
costs
is
a
more
sensible
investment
target
as
the
development
of
onshore
fields
would
be
fraught
with
many
unnecessary
roadblocks
siphoning
blackmail
and
murder
are
just
a
few
of
the
regular
phenomena
