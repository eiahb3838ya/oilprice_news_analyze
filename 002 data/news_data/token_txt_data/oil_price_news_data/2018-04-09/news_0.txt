will shale become the next victim of the china-us trade war?
one
can
hardly
call
it
a
trade
war
just
for
a
trade
war
may
be
a
more
apt
the
shale
industry
which
has
enjoyed
a
mighty
good
run
in
the
last
year
may
soon
find
itself
the
next
target
as
china
and
the
united
states
face
off
in
the
fight
to
flesh
out
new
trade
a
day
has
gone
by
in
the
last
couple
of
weeks
without
hearing
the
latest
round
of
threats
analysis
of
said
threats
and
the
trump
administration
clamors
for
better
trading
terms
between
the
two
nations
it
s
a
trade
war
it
s
not
a
trade
war
china
has
too
much
to
lose
the
united
states
has
more
to
lose
than
it
thinks
it
s
merely
the
start
of
negotiations
it
s
the
end
of
negotiations
the
stock
market
plummets
it
rallies
it
plummets
again
but
in
this
continued
tit
for
tat
the
potential
effects
on
the
us
shale
industry
should
not
be
oil
exports
are
at
an
high
and
with
this
prestige
comes
a
unique
vulnerability
that
was
nonexistent
in
the
days
of
only
back
in
the
united
states
was
exporting
between
and
barrels
per
canada
being
the
only
recipient
thanks
to
an
export
ban
implemented
by
the
united
states
in
in
late
however
the
united
states
removed
the
ban
opening
up
its
oil
exports
to
other
nations
for

ending

us
crude
oil
exports
reached
an
average
of
million
meteoric
rise
for
a
nation
that
for
years
kept
its
oil
close
to
home
related
an
oil
price
rally
is
likelythis
rise
in
oil
exports
has
shifted
the
global
oil
industry
where
the
united
states
was
once
for
the
most
part
a
in
global
price
setting
in
the
industry
now
it
has
achieved
major
prowess
in
fact
us
crude
oil
production
and
its
subsequent
exports
is
giving
opec
and
russia
et
al
a
run
for
their
money
as
the
production
cut
pact
tries
desperately
to
rebalance
the
market
overhang
but
this
newfound
power
is
also
fraught
with
challenges
as
the
united
states
finds
itself
susceptible
to
geopolitical
risks
as
it

large
importer
of

is
none
other
than
third
largest
importer
of

behind
canada
and
mexico
at

in
latest
data
available
from
the
china
may
be
the
third
largest
importer
of
crude

the
volumes
exported
to
china
still
represent
less

of
the
total

exported
still
that
volume
represents
a
value
of

and
that
doesn

even

for

the
impact
of
tariffs
which
president
donald
trump
has
threatened
to
levy
on

would
be
felt
by
the
united
after
it
had
regained
some
ground

just

confounded

when
almost
everyone
expected
the

according

the
