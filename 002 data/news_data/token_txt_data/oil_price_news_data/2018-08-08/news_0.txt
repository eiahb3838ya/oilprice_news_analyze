eia: u.s. oil production growth is slowing
the

down
its

an

estimate
it
also
revised
down
its
forecast
for
next
year
s
average
output
to
down
from
downward
revision
comes
after
recently
released
data
from
the
agency
suggested
that
output
growth
during
this
past
spring
was
not
as
robust
as
previously
thought
the
eia
at
the
time
thought
shale
production
continued
to
grow
at
a
blistering
rate
with
production
rising
by
over
bpd
between
the
beginning
of
april
and
the
end
of
may
but
more
recent
data
suggests
that
production
actually
dipped
a
bit
over
that
may
seem
like
an
insignificant
revision
but
it
points
to
broader
problems
particularly
in
the
permian
basin
which
could
cause
the
to
undershoot
expectations
going
movements
in
the
rig
count
lend
a
little
more
weight
to
this
notion
while
the
number
of
rigs
bounces
around
from
week
to
week
the
overall
number
is
essentially
unchanged
since
may
and
in
the
permian
where
all
the
drilling
action
has
been
concentrated
the
rig
count
stood
at
at
the
start
of
august
no
higher
than
it
was
in
early
the
lower
forecast
for
output
this
year
reflects
slightly
slower
than
expected
growth
in
middle
quarters
of
this
year
possibly
related
to
pipeline
constraints
out
of
the
permian

drawthe
tone
is
not
one
of
alarm
to
be
sure
in
the
short
run
the
eia
is
much
more
sanguine
about
global

other
analysts

that
the

the

that

keep
the

supplied

the
revisions
to
data
from
months
ago
raise
questions
about
the
production
figures
coming
out
on
a
weekly
basis
right
now
that
weekly
data
says
that
the
is
producing
a
little
less
than
but
because
those
weekly
figures
are
repeatedly
revised
down
as
time
passes
there
is
a
good
chance
that
production
is
not
actually
that
high
right
now
other
analysts
say
the
challenges
facing
permian
drillers
are
larger
than
just
an
overestimation
of
output
in
addition
to
pipeline
constraints
drillers
face
other
operational
problems
escalating
costs
logistical
constraints
decreasing
cash
flows
and
the
intensity
of
operations
forcing
a
downwards
move
in
geological
quality
from
tier
to
tier
locations
may
be
just
a
few
of
the
reasons
for
initial
well
productivity
in
the
