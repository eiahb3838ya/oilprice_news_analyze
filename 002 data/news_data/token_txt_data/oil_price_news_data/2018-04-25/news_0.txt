yesterday
the

reinforced
the
mood
by
reporting
a
build
for

modest
build
of

in
the
authority
also
said
gasoline

had
gone
up
by
barrels
in
the

period
compared
with

s
latest
inventory
report
on
oil
prices
would
be
interesting
to
watch
api
s
figures
seemed
to
remind
market
players
that
not
all
fundamentals
are
bullish
for
oil
with
oil
production
continuing
to
be
the
main
headwind
for
opec
s
plans
to
push
up

higher
this

out
later
today
are
bound
to
reinforce
this

been
growing
steadily
since
late
related
what
is
a
fair
price
for
oil
in
addition
to
fundamentals
there
has
been
a
shift
in
geopolitical
sentiment
after
france
s
president
emmanuel
macron
yesterday
called
for
a
new
iran
deal
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
sanctions
against
tehran
that
the
latter
warned
will
lead
to
serious
consequences
without
going
into
the
threat
of
new
iran
sanctions
has
been
one
of
the
drivers
behind
the
latest
rally
the
possibility
that
this
threat
could
be
neutralized
is
bound
to
reverse
the
mood
on
the
market
even
so
as
bloomberg
reports
wti
has
gained

since
the
start
of
april
on
the
back
of
these
geopolitical
concerns
and

latest
round
of

the
opec
camp
these
were
supported
by
a
further
