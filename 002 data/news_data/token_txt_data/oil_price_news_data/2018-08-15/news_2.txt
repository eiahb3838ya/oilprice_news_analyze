crude-by-rail could save the permian boom
cbr
has
been
a
savior
for
north
american
producers
seeking
higher
returns
for
heavily
discounted
crudes
caused
by
a
lack
of
pipeline
capacity
and
cbr
once
again
is
on
the
rise
north
american
shipments
of
petroleum
and
petroleum
products
are
up
over
compared
to
in
may
nearly
barrels
per
day
were
shipped
by
rail
from
canada
to
the
nearly
five
times
that
of
june
but
the
story
of
cbr
is
really
about
how
price
differentials
became
so
large
in
certain
western
canadian
producers
intense
opposition
regulatory
changes
legal
limbo
political
tensions
and
foreign
interference
from
well
funded
environmental
lobbies
have
muddled
new
projects
in
western
canada
new
export
capacity
has
been
politically
denied

producers
the
story
is
quite
a
bit
different
while
opposition
has
been
present
at
standing
rock
for
example
midstreamers
largely
could
not
keep
up
with
blistering
pace
of
production
set
off
by
the
shale
the
us
energy
information
administration
eia
estimates
that
us
crude
production
will
more
than
double
that
of
and
sit
around
million
barrels
per
day
often
pipelines
were
needed
where
there
was
no
previous
or
oil
or
natural
gas
infrastructure
in
addition
pipelines
can
t
be
built
overnight
years
of
planning
permitting
and
construction
are
global
crude
prices
now
stabilized
from
the
price
crash
in
all
is
not
well
in
western
canada
and
west
mexico
massive
price
differentials
are
preventing
some
producers
from
enjoying
the
current
price
recovery
a
large
western
canadian
texas
intermediate
differential
is
back
sitting
at
a
painful
us

august

morgan
stanley
suggests
that
with
increasing
permian
production
and
lack
of
take
away
capacity
the
differential
of
per

july
could
blowout
to
per
barrel
in
related
saudi
crackdown
on
canada
could
backfirehowever
there
are
some
signs
that
cbr
may
not
be
the
savior
it
is
hoped
to
be
to
start
lease
rates
for
dot
cars
have
jumped
from
to
per
month
the
size
of
the
crude
oil
fleet
sits
at
about
cars
compared
to
nearly
in
and
tariffs
affecting
new
pipeline
construction
could
also
impact
the
rail
companies
that
do
not
make
the
trump
administration
s
steel
tariff
waiver
list
one
can
expect
additional
costs
for
tanker
car
construction
to
be
passed
onto
customers
producers
hit
by
large
price
differentials
may
have
to
pay
even
more
for
each
new
or
tanker
car
they
buy
or
make
matters
worse
bnsf
is
now
refusing
to
haul
tanker
cars
the
majority
of
which
are
legacy
cars
retrofitted
with
additional
safety
features
this
would
complicate
things
for
the
owners
of
roughly
tanker
cars
because
bnsf
moves
a
lot
of
crude
in
the
last
quarter
of
nearly
half
of
all
cbr
was
shipped
by
bnsf
if
other
rail
operators
do
the
same
those
could
quickly
be
sent
to
america
s
empty
places
to
collect
graffiti
and
birds
nests
just
like
thousands
of
although
tanker
car
manufacturers
have
been
building
at
a
steady
clip
about
since
the
impact
of
removing
over
from
service
will
be
more
than
noticeable
not
every
owner
may
be
in
a
position
to
fork
over
additional
dollars
to
buy
especially
after
retrofitting
their
old
or
it
to
say
american
fuel
and
petrochemical
manufacturers
are
concerned
with
bnsf
s
decision
to
refuse
certain
tank
cars
and
are
currently
considering
options
to
address
these
concerns
with
the
however
bnsf
may
very
well
indeed
have
the
right
to
exclude
use
of
equipment
that
it
feels
is
unsafe
or
too
risky
to
haul
we
shall
see
how
this
pans
factors
can
also
impact
cbr
major
logistical
issues
arise
during
extended
periods
of
extreme
cold
weather
in
canada
and
the
northern
for
example
rail
operators
deal
with
icy
tracks
and
can
t
haul
as
many
tanker
cars
likewise
trains
must
run
at
lower
speeds
and
more
locomotives
are
needed
to
move
the
same
volume
of
product
this
can
lead
to
rail
terminal
congestion
cbr
shippers
also
have
to
contend
with
grain
shippers
after
fall
harvest
during
the
winter
months
related
who
profits
from
iran
s
oil
major
exodus
and
then
there
are
unique
factors
that
arise
based
on
the
region
for
example
the
permian
is
sucking
up
of
all
frac
sand
and
ironically
enough
is
impacting
cbr
capacity
in
the
in
western
canada
and
the
permian
will
be
paying
close
attention
to
the
outcome
of
trump
s
steel
tariff
waiver
list
both
tanker
car
manufacturers
and
midstreamers
bnsf
s
decision
to
ban
tankers
and
other
regional
factors
that
can
impede
take
away
capacity
the
eia
estimates
production
soaring
to
million
barrels
per
day
in
canadian
heavy
crude
could
rise
by
half
a
million
barrels
per
day
in
the
same
period
but
even
without
pressure
on
the
market
for
tanker
cars
suggesting
cbr
is
a

new
north
american
pipelines

be
quite
