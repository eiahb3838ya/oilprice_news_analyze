the productivity problem in the permian
the
campaign
to
boost
efficiency
and
productivity
in
the
shale
patch
could
be
nearing
its
in
the
permian
basin
is
already
starting
to
slowdown
largely
due
to
pipeline
constraints
however
there
is
also
a
series
of
other
data
points
that
suggests
that
shale
drillers
are
bumping
up
against
a
ceiling
in
terms
of
productivity
and
data
from
the
eia
shows
a
rather
startling
slowdown
in
the
amount
of
oil
that
the
average
rig
can
produce
from
a
new
well
in
the
permian
in
september
the
eia
expects
production
per
rig
to
fall
by
barrels
per
day
bpd
in
the
permian
compared
to
august
levels
that
means
that
when
a
company
deploys
a
rig
to
drill
a
new
well
that
rig
will
produce
a
little
less
oil
than
it
did
compared
to
the
average
rig
did
a
month
earlier
click

productivity
has
seesawed
a
bit
over
the
years
spiking
in
when
the
industry
scrapped
inefficient
rigs
during
the
market
downturn
indeed
some
of
the
recent
decline
in
productivity
can
be
chalked
up
to
the
industry
rushing
to
drill
more
in
this
sense
it
isn
t
that
the
rigs
are
necessarily
less
productive
just
that
there
are
so
many
of
them
out
there
in
the
permian
that
the
productivity
figures
fall
because
the
denominator
is
it
s
also
a
reflection
of
the
fact
that
drillers
are
being
forced
into
less
desirable
locations
with
the
field
so
crowded
related
oil
prices
jump
as
saudis
cap
oil
supply
we
believe
that
the
nature
of
shale
exploitation
and
the
intensity
of
activity
in
the
permian
means
that
production
from
tier
geological
locations
those
with
the
best
pay
the
optimum
pressure
is
starting
to
move
to
tier
which
is
unable
to
achieve
the
same
rates
of

standard

bottlenecks

rising

to
note
is
the

backlog
of

uncompleted
wells

which
could
also
help
explain
the

in

the

to
have

rising
to
a
total

is
little
to
no

left
on

s
pipelines
plus
a
growing
number
of
bottlenecks
are
cropping
up
for
other
services
like
completion
services
rigs
labor
sand
water
etc
that
means
that
companies
may
drill
a
well
but
leave
it
uncompleted
for
the
time
being
as
a
result
the
rig
count
reflects
the
drilling
but
there
is
no
actual
oil
production
that
shows
up
in
the
data
which
may
give
off
the
appearance
of
low
absolute
numbers
production
is
also
growing
but
growing
much
more
slowly
the
eia
expects
output
in
the
permian
to
rise
by
bpd
from
august
to
september
an
increase
that
is
half
as
large
as
the
monthly
increases
that
the
basin
routinely
posted
earlier
this
drag
on
the
basin
is
the
fact
that
the
legacy
decline
rate
deepens
with
each
passing
month
shale
wells
suffer
from
precipitous
decline
rates
around
percent
of
a
well
s
lifetime
production
occurs
in
the
first
two
years
as
a
result
every
month
thousands
of
existing
wells
in
the
basin
lose
output
which
is
collectively
described
as
legacy
decline
the
number
is
larger
in
the
permian
than
in
other
places
only
because
overall
production
is
so
much
there
is
a
bit
of
treadmill
aspect
to
drilling
you
have
to
drill
more
to
keep
output
flat
the
sheer
size
of
the
permian
means
that
the
drilling
needs
to
continue
at
a
high
rate
to
maintain
overall
output
so
the
unfolding
slowdown
in
drilling
largely
because
of
pipeline
constraints
could
threaten
