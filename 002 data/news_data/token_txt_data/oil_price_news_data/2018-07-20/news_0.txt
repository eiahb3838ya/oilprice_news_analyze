uk natural gas production falls as usage climbs
uk
c
cit
was
expected
by
many
me
included
but
more
importantly
ukoga
and
a
couple
of
the
bigger
oil
and
gas
consultancies
that
uk
offshore
oil
production
would
increase
significantly
from
to
exceed
kbpd
for
the
yearly
average
in
so
far
this
is
proving
a
bit
of
a
challenge
march
production
was
kbpd
down
percent
and
percent
but
up
percent
for
the
first
quarter
compared
with
it
s
possible
that
some
fields
have
not
reported
but
those
showing
zero
for
the
month
are
not
big
producers
the
biggest
single
field
drop
came
from
clair
but
most
field
saw
declines
even
the
newer
ones
jodi
data
indicates
there
will
be
a
rise
in
may
but
not
above
kbpd
and
after
that
there
is
usually
a
summer
dip
because
of
maintenance
shutdowns
plus
this

some

two
of
the
largest
oil
producers
buzzard
and
the
golden
eagle
area
development
both
operated
by
nexen
have
started
accelerated
decline
following
increasing
water
breakthrough
especially
noticeable
in
gead
over
the
past
year
the
newest
large
field
is
scheihallion
this
is
a
redevelopment
with
its
neighbouring
field
loyal
through
the
glen
lyon
fpso
also
called
the
quad
project
which
was
started
last
year
so
far
the
combined
decline
in
buzzard
and
gead
has
exceeded
growth
in
clair
ridge
platforms
which
also
exploit
the
heavy
oil
in
the
clair
field
were
installed
last
year
but
there
have
been
multiple
delays
and
production
is
not
now
expected
until
later
this
year
once
it
is
ramped
up
which
could
take
three
or
four
years
despite
it
having
some
predrilled
wells
it
will
be
the
largest
producer
at
to
mmbpd
and
has
an
plateau
while
will
plateau

pierce
and
captain
are
heavy
oil
developments
pierce
was
redeveloped
in
and
captain
has
recently
switched
to
using
polymer
injection
to
improve
the
water
flood
performance
heavy
oil
projects
require
many
wells
tend
to
produce
high
water
cuts
from
the
outset
and
have
low
recovery
factors
clair
and
clair
ridge
are
mentioned
above
kraken
was
a
heavy
oil
in
june
last
year
it
has
the
largest
water
processing
capacity
in
the
uk
north
sea
and
has
already
seen
water
at
to
percent
mariner
is
another
due
to
start
later
this
year
for
statoil
it
uses
condensate
for
eor
and
there
are
other
heavy
oil
prospects
like
bressay
cancelled
by
statoil
when
the
oil
price
collapsed

another
reason
for
the
possibly
lower
than
expected
total
production
is
early
decline
in
many
of
the
smaller
producers
started
up
from
late
through
for
example
the
production
plan
for
scolty
crathes
had
over
bpd
average
in
and
a
decline
out
to
but
the
current
production
is
around
bpd
and
declining
all
from
crathes
as
the
scolty
field
expired
after
about
four
months
similarly
solan
was
predicted
to
average
around
bpd
in
but
achieved
bpd
only
briefly
and
is
now
