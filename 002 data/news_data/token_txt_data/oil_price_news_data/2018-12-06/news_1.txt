oil prices tank despite large crude draw
as
oil
markets
hold
their
breath
for
s
announcement
of
the
final
production
cuts
to
take
place
starting
next
year
the
energy
information
administration
served
a
nice
surprise
to
oil
bulls
by
reporting
an
inventory
draw
in
crude
oil
of
million
barrels
for
the
week
to
november
report
came
two
days
after
the
american
petroleum
institute
disappointed
bulls
with
an
estimated
inventory
build
of
million
barrels
for
the
same
week
pushing
wti
prices
down
closer
to
us
a
eia
said
refineries
processed
million
barrels
of
crude
daily
last
week
producing
million
bpd
of
gasoline
and
million
bpd
of
distillate
fuel
a
week
earlier
refineries
processed
million
bpd
with
gasoline
production
at
million
bpd
and
distillate
fuel
production
at
million
inventories
last
week
added
million
barrels
with
distillate
inventories
rising
by
million
barrels
this
compared
with
an
decline
in
gasoline
inventories
and
a
rise
in
distillate
fuel
inventories
a
week
has
been
on
the
slide
this
week
pressured
by
uncertainties
surrounding
this
round
of
production
cuts
and
the
surprise
announcement
by
qatar
that
it
was
leaving
the
cartel
starting
in
january
there
has
been
speculation
that
iraq
opec
s
producer
may
follow
as
it
can
not
really
afford
to
reduce
its
stock
market
dip
accelerated
the
oil
price
drop
but
trading
was
not
particularly
dynamic
ahead
of
the
oepc
meeting
in
vienna
the
cartel
will
release
a
statement
later
in
the
day
but
russia
has
yet
to
have
its
say
which
will
take
place
tomorrow
its
position
is
considered
once
again
the
maker
or
breaker
of
the
cut
deal
although
the
prevailing
mood
is
positive
with
a
high
degree
of
certainty
that
an
agreement
to
reduce
crude
oil
supply
will
be
the
time
