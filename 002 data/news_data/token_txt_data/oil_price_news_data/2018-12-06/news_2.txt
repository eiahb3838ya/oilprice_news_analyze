and
ministers
that
oversaw
the

cuts
from

of
this
year
has
once
again
recommended
that
the
cartel
and
its
partners
reduce
crude
oil
production
tass
reports
citing
the
energy
minister
of
oman
mohammed
bin
hamad
al
rumhy
we
just
agreed
on
the
reduction
actually
the
level
of
reduction
will
be
discussed
in
the
next
two
days
al
rumhy
told
media
in
vienna
later
today
however
opec
will
come
out
with
a
statement
on
the
topic
that
will
reveal
its
final
position
on
the
cuts
amid
a
lot
of
internal
russia
and
several
other
producers
will
join
the
talks
and
the
amount
of
the
be
specified
al
rumhy
said
he
believed
could
reduce
its
combined
output
by
million
bpd
the
agreement
will
be
in
force
for
six
months
the
minister
also
about
cuts
began
last
month
initiated
by
saudi
arabia
amid
slumping
oil
prices
analysts
projected
cuts
in
the
range
of
to
million
bpd
but
most
acknowledged
this
time
it
might
be
harder
for
the
kingdom
to
get
everyone
on
board
iraq
is
not
the
only
one
that
can
t
really
afford
the
cuts
iran
has
stated
it
will
not
discuss
its
production
quota
while
under
sanctions
and
russia
has
made
it
clear
it
was
fine
with
prices
where
they
are
yet
president
putin
said
at
the
meeting
cooperation
between
russia
and
saudi
arabia
would
continue
which
suggested
russian
oil
companies
will
join
the
saudi
arabia
and
russia
prevail
in
the
discussions
the
only
issue
would
be
the
size
of
the
cut
unless
iraq
decides
to
quit
the
cartel
altogether
as
barclays
david
cohen
suggested
in
a
chat
with
cnbc
if
that
happens
whatever
cuts
are
agreed
would
have
about
the
same
effect
on
prices
as
the
entry
into
effect
of
sanctions
against
iran
after
market
players
had
months
to
prepare
for
opec
failed
to
reveal
a
solid
agreement
in
vienna
after
hours
of
meetings
the
cartel
cancelled
its
news
conference
awaiting
the
russian
delegation
set
to
arrive
on
friday
