it

sneaking

before

to
mark
a
record
month
of

despite
this
milestone
china
continues
to
hold
the
mantle
as
the
leading
asian
destination
for

crude
but
that
could
change
going

with
the
growing
likelihood
of
impending
on
our
projections
india
is
going
to
import
nearly
as
much
us
crude
as
china
in
august
as
its
appetite
for
light
sweet
us
crude
increases
just
as
china
loses
look
set
to
kick
in
as
soon
as
september
meaning
that
any
barrels
arriving
on
chinese
shores
will
be
hit
with
a
percent
tariff
taking
us
crude
from
a
discount
versus
global
benchmarks
to
a
premium
of
unfavorable

will
slam
the

current
