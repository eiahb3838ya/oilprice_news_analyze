china
national
petroleum
corporation

will
invest

equivalent
of
more
than
us
billion
by
on
boosting
its
oil
and
gas
production
in
the
western
region
of
xinjiang
to
mitigate
the
impact
of
declining
production
from
oil
and
gas
fields
in
china
s
said
on
wednesday
that
it
would
invest
more
than
us
billion
billion
yuan
in
the
xinjiang
autonomous
region
in
the
west
to
boost
production
in
the
region
to
more
than
million
tons
of
oil
equivalent
between
and
to
reuters
calculations
the
investment
that
cnpc

today
would
be
equivalent
to
the
total
upstream
investment
made
by
cnpc
s
listed
unit
and
china
s
largest
oil
and
gas
producer
petrochina
in
investment
in
the
xinjiang
autonomous
region
would
serve
several
purposes
according
to
analysts
first
boosting
production
in
the
region
would
help
offset
declining
production
from
the
ageing
fields
in
the
daqing
oil
province
in
the
northeast
the
investment
would
also
serve
to
increase
china
s
domestic
natural
gas
production
as
beijing
looks
to
switch
from
coal
to
the
more
environmentally
friendly
fuel
in
addition
china
would
be
looking
to
boost
the
economy
infrastructure
and
natural
gas
access
in
the
unruly
autonomous
region
in
its
far
west
bordering
central
asia
that
has
seen
ethnic
unrest
in
recent
years
related
is
this
the
next
coal
megaproject
i
think
that
the
primary
factor
is
to
support
the
central
government
policy
to
invest
more
and
support
economic
development
in
the
west
liutong
zhang
director
at
hong
waterrock

economics
told
oil
production
in
the
western
part
of
the
country
is
not
expected
to
affect
china
s
crude
oil
imports
because
the
higher
production
would
offset
declining
output
at
mature
fields
elsewhere
in
the
s
crude
oil
production
dropped
by
percent
on
the
year
in
june
and
was
also
down
compared
to
the

in
may
between
