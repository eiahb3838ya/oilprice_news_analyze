petrochemicals: the future for big oil
plastics
and
petrochemicals
are
the
future
of
big
oil
there
is
hardly
any
question
about
that
if
by
future
we
mean
the
distant
future
there
is
still
no
consensus
and
there
won
t
be
any
time
soon
about
when
exactly
peak
oil
demand
will
descend
upon
the
oil
industry
but
most
forecasters
seem
to
give
the
industry
another
few
decades
of
drawing
the
bulk
of
their
income
from
selling
fuels
after
that
it
will
be
plastics
and
oil
is
already
preparing
and
it
s
not
alone
the
world
s
biggest
oil
company
in
terms
of
reserves
saudi
aramco
has
been
very
active
in
seeking
refining
and
petrochemicals
projects
to
invest
in
as
part
of
its
efforts
to
secure
demand
for
its
crude
and
maximize
its
value
as
latest
news
is
a
deal
between
aramco
and
a
california
startup
that
will
allow
the
saudi
company
to
use
the
startup
s
oxidative
coupling
of
methane
technology
in
its
petrochemicals
operations
this
technology
may
sound
impressive
but
it
is
in
fact
an
alternative
to
the
traditional
way
of
converting
gas
into
ethylene
the
main
raw
material
for
plastics
this
alternative
according
to
the
california
company
siluria
can
increase
the
portion
of
crude
oil
converted
into
chemical
feedstocks
to
percent
per
barrel
from
the
current
percent
while
the
rest
is
made
into
and
siluria
announced
their
deal
in
a
joint
statement
without
going
into
financial
details
however
the
signal
is
loud
and
clear
aramco
is
doubling
down
on
its
refining
and
plastics
bet
made
amid
the
latest

provided
some
figures
in
a
recent
interview
with
reuters
aramco
which
produces
around
million
bpd
of
crude
oil
aims
to
increase
its
refining
capacity
from
million
bpd
now
to
million
million
bpd
and
to
double
its
petrochemicals
production
by
our
strategy
is
very
simple
we
want
to
be
at
to
million
barrels
per
day
of
participated
refining
capacity
and
we
are
going
forward
by
trying
to
be
a
top
leader
in
chemicals
by
he
saudi
company
is
committing
billions
of
dollars
to
new
petrochemical
projects
including
a
us
refinery
and
petrochemical
complex
in
india
and
a
us
investment
in
another
complex
in
malaysia
and
is
in
negotiations
with
companies
for
more
partnerships
in
this
focusing
on
plastics
and
petrochemicals
is
the
only
way
forward
for
oil
companies
if
we
re
talking
about
their
core
business
excluding
a
shift
to
renewable
energy
it
s
the
only
way
but
a
threat
awaits
oil
companies
who
take
that
path
the
fight
against
plastics
related
is
this
the
most
contentious
opec
meeting
yet
the
world
s
plastics
problem
is
so
grave
that
it
has
spurred
a
renewed
push
against
plastic
products
in
europe
that
resulted
in
a
ban
of
cutlery

and

and
europe
is
not
alone
in
this
push
earlier
this

announced
its

the

for

even
if

the

of

will
be
