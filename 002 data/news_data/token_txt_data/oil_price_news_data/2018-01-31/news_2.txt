oil prices fall after strong crude inventory build
as
investment
banks
become
increasingly
bullish
on
crude
oil
the
energy
information
administration
reported
a
build
in
crude
oil
inventories
for
the
week
ending
january
the
report
comes
a
day
after
the
american
petroleum
institute
surprised
markets
once
again
with
an
estimated
build
of
million
had
expected
the
eia
to
report
a
draw
of
million
barrels
in
keeping
with
a
string
of
tenth
consecutive
weekly
stockpiles
according
to
the
eia
fell
by
million
barrels
from
a
build
of
million
barrels
for
the
previous
week
gasoline
production
last
week
averaged
million
barrels
versus
million
bpd
in
the
week
before
refineries
processed
an
average
million
bpd
of
crude
last
week
compared
with
million
bpd
a

approaching
some
analysts
are
starting
to
warn
we
will
begin
to
see
inventory
builds
and
this
could
hurt
prices
for
a
earlier
this
week
the
eia
took
the
trouble
to
defend
its
weekly
numbers
which
some
industry
watchers
have
shunned
as
lacking
credibility
the
weekly
inventory
and
more
importantly
production
have
strong
taken
by
extrapolation
from
the
eia
s
energy
outlook

a
buy
this
is
necessitated
by
the
fact
that
although
oil
producers
report
weekly
data
it
is
impossible
to
gather
enough
of
this
data
to
make
a
calculation
based
purely
on
it
within
the
very
short
reporting
window
producers
report
on
monday
and
the
weekly
petroleum
status
report
is
published
the
eia
uses
its
steo
figures
which
are
again
forecast
and
not
actual
while
it
would
seem
that
estimating
production
numbers
based
on
forecast
data
wouldn
t
be
too
accurate
the
eia
said
that
in
hindsight
the
accuracy
is
very
high
with
the
average
difference
between
estimated
and
actual
figures
standing
at
percent
in
absolute
other
words
all
those
doubting
how
accurate
the
numbers
that
the
eia
releases
every
wednesday
can
rest
assured
that
they
are
in
fact
