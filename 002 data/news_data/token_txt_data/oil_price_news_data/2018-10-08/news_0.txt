north sea oil renaissance could flop
last
year
when
oilprice
wrote
about
a
rush
of
investments
into
north
sea
oil
and
gas
it
looked
like
that
part
of
the
oil
world
was
undergoing
a
seismic
shift
with
big
oil
being
replaced
by
leaner
private
field
operators
that
wood
mackenzie
said
could
turn
things
around
technology
helped
too
things
were
looking
up
for
one
of
the
oldest
regions
in
the
world
now
the
big
oil
exodus
continues
and
some
analysts
and
industry
insiders
worry
that
the
recovery
of
the
north
sea
may
falter
in
the
not
too
distant
there
s
been
a
string
of
deals
in
the
north
sea
equinor
earlier
this
month
said
it
had
agreed
to
buy
chevron
s
stake
in
rosebank
one
of
the
largest
undeveloped
oil
and
gas
finds
in
the
british
section
of
the
north
sea
for
chevron
the
deal
is
part
of
a
larger
plan
to
exit
the
north
sea
in
full
marathon
oil
announced
it
would
leave
the
north
sea
too
and
would
instead
focus
on
its
domestic
recently
an
independent
company
enquest
bought
the
remainder
of
bp
s
stake
in
the
magnus
field
bp
went
on
a
selling
spree
in
the
north
sea
last
year
and
even
offloaded
its
forties
pipeline
another

secrets

s
most
successful

the
japanese
deal
is
worth
noting
s
p
global
platts
recently
reported
some
in
the
industry
were
worried
about
the
exit
of
japanese
companies
from
the
north
sea
it
quoted
an
unnamed
source
as
saying
japanese
investors
in
the
north
sea
were
fed
up
with
project
delays
and
cost
overruns
so
they
were
leaving
for
good
japan
effectively
made
its
decision
about
the
north
sea
about
three
years
ago
they
would
say
the
operations
in
the
north
sea
are
at
all
efficient
largely
those
criticisms
were
right
in
many
ways
they
still
even
right
now
the
source
told
s
p
global
the
same
time
there
are
all
these
private
companies
flocking
to
the
north
sea
so
all
should
be
good
right
only
it
s
not
exactly
all
good
a
september
report
from
industry
body
oil
and
gas
uk
warned
drilling
in
the
north
sea
is
at
the
lowest
since
and
in
the
near
future
capacity
constraint
might
emerge
across
the
supply
said
the
body
also
noted
that
operating
costs
have
fallen
by
as
much
as
percent
and
average
us
a
barrel
and
that
production
this
year
will
likely
be
percent
higher
than
four
years
ago
before
the
price
collapse
really
hit
the
oil
and
gas
authority
adds
in
its
latest
industry
overview
that
breakeven
level
in
the
north
sea
is
now
below
us
per
barrel
of
falling
operating
costs
and
breakeven
prices
and
with
all
this
private
equity
money
flowing
into
mature
fields
and
new
discoveries
the
picture
emerges
as
overall
positive
for
the
north
sea
yet
it
could
be
even
better
were
the
government
willing
to
lend
a
helping
would
say
it
already
did
when
it
slashed
taxes
for
the
oil
and
gas
industry
a
couple
of
years
ago
but
this
slashing
came
too
soon
after
a
tax
rise
in
creating
a
feeling
of
uncertainty
among
delicate
investor
souls
this
according
to
analysts
and
industry
insiders
s
p
global
platts
spoke
to
means
investors
are
not
all
that
willing
to
enter
the
north
sea
at
least
not
the
british
north
sea
we
chosen
to
invest
heavily
in
norway
because
of
many
things
but
its
fiscal
stability
is
one
of
those
things
the
uk
and
its
instability
from
a
fiscal
perspective
is
a
massive
detractor
and
will
be
for
others

the

of
faroe

the
picture
for
this
part
of
the
oil
world
