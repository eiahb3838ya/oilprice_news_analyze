opec could “relax” production cuts
it
was
only
a
few
weeks
ago
that
top
officials
from
opec
nations
were
issuing
statements
assuring
the
market
that
the
group
s
production
cuts
would
remain
in
effect
through
the
end
of
with
the
possibility
of
even
extending
them
into
next
year
but
now
with
the
vienna
meeting
just
a
few
weeks
away
opec
is
suddenly
warming
up
to
the
idea
of
lifting
the
production
oil
market
is
tighter
than
it
has
been
in
years
oecd
oil
inventories
fell
back
to
the
average
in
march
and
because
that
is
the
latest
month
for
which
data
is
available
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
inventories
are
already
below
that
average
level
brent
prices
have
topped
per
barrel
for
the
first
time
since
and
the
outages
in
venezuela
angola
nigeria
and
potentially
iran
are
sending
jitters
throughout
the
oil
oil
minister
khalid
had
insisted
that
the
higher
prices
were
which
is
to
say
an
exaggerated
run
up
relative
to
the
underlying
fundamentals
of
supply
and
demand
on
multiple
occasions
he
has
repeated
opec
s
determination
to
keep
the
cuts
in
place
and
sent
signals
that
opec
and
russia
would
solidify
a
arrangement
to
presumably
manage
the
doubt
the
motivation
to
continue
to
tighten
the
market
is
in
large
part
stemming
from
the
ipo
of
saudi
aramco
a
very
bullish
driver
for
the
oil
market
because
saudi
arabia
has
seemed
impervious
to
market
concerns
about
since
they
are
aiming
for
higher
prices
for
the
public
offering
related
is
the
ethanol
industry
under
siege
suddenly
however
the
cracks
in
the
group
s
resolve
are
widening
saudi
arabia
russia
and
the
rest
of
opec
are
likely
this
week
to
discuss
a
controlled
relaxation
of
with
the
opec
and
target
according
to
argus
media
a
gulf
source
familiar
with
saudi
thinking
told
argus
that
a
relaxation
is
a
big
possibility
at
the
upcoming
meeting
in
vienna
on
june
be
clear
it
would
not
amount
to
an
unwinding
or
a
removal
or
a
phase
out
of
the
production
limits
such
a
proposal
is
reportedly
not
under
consideration
instead
opec
has
a
more
modest
proposal
in
mind
simply
bringing
production
levels
back
up
to
the
stated
discrepancy
largely
comes
down
to
the
catastrophic
production
losses
in
venezuela
output
in
the
south
american
nation
fell
to
just
million
barrels
per
day
in
april
down
nearly
bpd
from
levels
crucially
venezuela
s
april
production
is
bpd
below
the
level
that
it
is
allowed
to
produce
as
part
of
the
opec
agreement
and
falling
on
an
ongoing
of
those
declines
the
compliance
rate
for
opec
on
the
whole
shot
up
to
percent
in
april
according
to
argus
a
while
venezuela
s
deterioration
was
a
boon
to
the
rest
of
opec
which
allowed
members
to
earn
higher
revenues
than
expected
because
of
the
oil
price
rally
but
at
this
point
the
oil
market
is
on
the
verge
of
tightening
a
little
too
much
the
prospect
of
outages
in
iran
has
changed
the
equation
because
the
losses
while
not
inevitable
would
be
decisive
to
an
oil
market
that
now
has
little
margin
for
nobody
knows
exactly
what
will
happen
to
iranian
exports
how
much
they
will
be
how
much
we
are
going
to
miss
a
gulf
source
told
argus
so
opec
and
want
to
judge
the
situation
to
get
a
better
picture
of
what
is
really
going
on
but
if
there
is
a
need
to
relax
compliance
they
related
is
oil
enough
for
shale
drillers
the
proposal
under
consideration
for
the
vienna
meeting
would
be
to
allow
slightly
higher
levels
of
production
because
most
of
the
participating
nations
are
already
producing
close
to
their
maximum
additional
supply
would
have
to
come
from
a
relatively
short
list
of
nations
namely
saudi
arabia
russia
the
uae
and
could
still
keep
its
production
limits
in
place
but
allow
spare
capacity
nations
to
add
supply
back
to
the
market
but
only
a
little
bit
so
the
collective
ceiling
is
not
argus
points
out
allowing
for
higher
levels
of
production
from
gulf
countries
at
the
expense
of
iran
and
venezuela
could
potentially
undercut
cohesion
among
the
group
already
fierce
regional
rivals
iran
might
perceive
the
relaxing
of
production
limits
as
a
way
for
gulf
nations
to
take
its
market
share
opec
s
influence
is
only
as
powerful
as
the
group
s
willingness
to
work
together
so
future
coordination
could
be
undermined
if
a
decision
in
vienna
stokes
animosity
between
some
of
the
cartel
s
top
with
oil
passing
per
barrel
and
pricing
risk
skewed
to
the
upside
opec
might

compelled
