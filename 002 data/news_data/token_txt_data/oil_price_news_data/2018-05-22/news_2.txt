could venezuela prompt opec to pump more?
venezuela
s
oil
industry
is
collapsing
fast
no
wonder
then
that
opec
is
finally
talking
about
perhaps
raising
production
to
make
up
for
venezuela
s
overdelivering
on
production
cuts
as
reuters
reported
yesterday
the
cartel
is
looking
closely
at
the
country
s
oil
production
to
make
sure
it
is
low
enough
for
other
members
to
step
in
and
start
pumping
opec
is
talking
about
taking
action
this
means
it
is
not
too
happy
with
oil
prices
at
the
current
level
which
at
the
time
of
writing
was
us
a
barrel
for
brent
and
us
a
barrel
for
energy
ministers
of
saudi
arabia
and
the
uae
already
said
as
much
they
last
week
said
there
was
no
fundamental
reason
for
brent
to
trade
at
over
us
a
was
enough
supply
to
compensate
for
any
losses
when
sanctions
against
iran
kick
in
later
this
year
now
other
opec
officials
are
practically
admitting
that
brent
at
us
or
more
may
not
be
the
best
price
level
for
is
an
interesting
development
venezuela
s
oil
production
is
now
at
the
lowest
in
about
seven
decades
at
just
million
bpd
and
all
signs
point
towards
a
further
decline
after
the
of
nicolas
maduro
and
the
very
good
chance
for
more
punitive
action
from
washington
which
will
no
doubt
target
the
country
s
battered
oil
industry
even
without
any
further
sanctions
from
the
venezuela
has
no
money
to
maintain
its
oil
production
let
alone
increase
should
be
grateful
to
venezuela
thanks
to
this
inexorable
slide
in
venezuelan
oil
production
the
cartel
exceeded
its
overall
production
quota
under
the
cuts
deal
in
some
months
by
a
wide
margin
pushing
prices
to
highs
venezuela
s
oil
industry
collapse
also
compensated
for
higher
than
agreed
production
in
some
opec
members
such
as
iraq
as
a
result
of
all
this
we
got
brent
at
us
which
is
what
some
opec
members
wanted
related
oil
majors
double
down
on
refiningnow
opec
is
considering
taking
action
and
this
is
telling
despite
the
upbeat
rhetoric
from
khalid
and
a
number
of
investment
bank
commodity
analysts
who
have
argued
in
recent
weeks
that
before
oil
prices
start
hurting
demand
brent
could
climb
above
us
opec
is
already
considering
action
with
brent
at
us
could
it
be
that
these
upbeat
predictions
were
a
little
bit
off
the
mark
if
we
leave
geopolitical
risk
aside
the
fundamental
factors
driving
prices
higher
in
the
last
couple
months
were
tightening
supply
from
opec
thanks
to
the
cuts
and
venezuela
and
stronger
demand
especially
in
asia
also
analyst
wildly
lost
iranian
supply
following
the
reintroduction
of
sanctions
helped
this
stronger
demand
by
the
way
has
been
one
of
the
top
arguments
of
oil
bulls
in
support
of
their
expectations
that
even
brent
at
us
won
t
hurt
china
has
made
it
clear
it
will
continue
buying
crude
for
iran
with
or
without
sanctions
so
the
effect
of
these
sanctions
on
supply
is
likely
to
be
a
lot
milder
than
the
last
time
when
the
west
imposed
sanctions
on
iran
china
in
other
words
has
secured
the
supply
to
match
its
demand
even
with
opec
production
at
current
levels
and
it
will
likely
prefer
iranian
crude
to
other
opec
crude
because
it
can
pay
for
it
in
yuan
related
india
to
saudi
arabia
we
need
stable
and
moderate
oil
pricesindia
has
asked
saudi
arabia
for
assurances
that
oil
prices
will
remain
stable
and
moderate
noting
that
us
is
way
above
reasonable
the
message
could
not
be
clearer
brent
at
us
is
already
a
problem
for
the
world
s
consumer
therefore
assured
his
indian
counterpart
dharmendra
pradhan
that
opec
will
make
an
effort
to
ensure
availability
of
adequate
supplies
to
offset
any
potential
shortfalls
so
opec
is
right
to
look
closely
at
oil
industry
developments
in
venezuela
although
there
will
hardly
be
any
surprises
coming
from
there
the
time
may
have
come
to
start
easing
the
production
quotas
as
russia
s
alexander
novak
suggested
at
an
earlier
meeting
with
opec
