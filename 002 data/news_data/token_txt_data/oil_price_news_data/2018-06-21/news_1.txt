discussed
on
cnbc
asia
last
night
core
opec
has
been
ramping
up
exports
this
month
ahead
of
tomorrow
opec
meeting
in
vienna
historically
production
typically
rises
ahead
of
an
opec
quota
hike
and
this
time
looks
no
arabia
kuwait
and
uae
the
key
proponents
of
the
opec
production
cut
deal
are
all
showing
significantly
higher
crude
exports
so
far
this
month
as

are
opened
once
again
our

this

saudi
exports
versus

they
have
been
below
it
for
every

in

and
a

except
for

now
june
exports
have
ramped
up
over
bpd
higher
than
last
terms
of
the

it
shows
flows
bound
for
asia
versus
the
october
level
flows
have
been
higher
in
every
month
except
april
and
may
as
saudi
has
favored
sending
its
crude
to
asia
at
the
expense
of
the
united
states
flows
bound
for
asia
so
far
this

are
the
highest

we
mentioned
previously
how
saudi
had
an
epiphany
in
late
may
of
last
year
realizing
that
by
substantially
cutting
flows
to
the
they
would
aid
inventory
draws
in
the
largest
most
timely
and
most
transparent
market
in
the
world
and
boost
bullish
sentiment

while
saudi
is
the
leading
crude
exporter
in
the
middle
east
by
a
long

it
is
also
the
leading
exporter
of
middle
distillates
particularly
gasoil
and
jet
lower
crude
exports
from
the
likes
of
saudi
and
kuwait
uae
sit
down
have
crimped
revenues
amid
the
opec
production
cut
deal
exports
of
middle
distillates
have
ramped
suggest
this
is
less
to
do
with
the
production
cut
deal
and
more
to
do
with
refining
capacity
expansion
in
the
region
either
way
materially
higher
middle
distillate
exports
are
helping
to
offset

exports
from

so
far
this

are
outpacing
