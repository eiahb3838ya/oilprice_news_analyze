china looks to capitalize on cheap iranian oil
it
s
been
a
week
since
president
donald
trump
announced
that
he
would
withdraw
from
the
iranian
nuclear
deal
reached
in
and
impose
powerful
economic
sanctions
against
the
islamic
republic
over
its
nuclear
this
was
a
horrible
deal
that
should
have
never
ever
been
made

stated
that
it

sanctions

block
american
firms
from
doing

even
more
controversial
it
also
prohibits

that
do

there
from
accessing
the

in
its
heelsiran
for
its
part
has
stated
that
it
will
remain
in
the
deal
as
have
eu
members
that
were
part
of
the
original
deal
hammered
out
by
barack
obama
shortly
after
the
sanctions
announcement
last
week
obama
said
that
trump
s
withdrawal
would
leave
the
world
less
safe
confronting
it
with
a
losing
choice
between
a
iran
or
another
war
in
the
middle
a
few
days
later
the
french
government
which
had
lobbied
with
trump
to
not
pull
out
of
the
accord
said
that
europe
was
prepared
to
introduce
measures
to
nullify
the
effect
of
trump
imposing
sanctions
on
any
firm
that
continues
to
do
business
with

is
adamant
over
the

john

trump
s
newly
installed
national
security
advisor
said
that
the
europeans
will
see
that
it
s
in
their
interests
to
come
along
with
us
rather
than
continue
with
the
deal
under
which
major
european
corporations
have
signed
billions
of
dollars
of
contracts
in
much
impact
while
the
politics
of
trump
s
sanctions
decision
plays
out
not
only
across
the
atlantic
with
traditional
allies
but
in
the
middle
east
other
ramifications
have
to
be
examined
including
just
how
much
sanctions
would
curb
iranian
oil
exports
and
that
answer
depends
on
who
you
analysts
have
predicted
that
sanctions
on
iran
would
remove
around
barrels
of
oil
per
day
which
would
of
course
tighten
global
oil
supplies
which
are
already
being
stretched
thin
among
the
production
cut
put
in
place
at
the
start
of
last
analysts
see
that
figure
a
bit
lower
initially
removing
around
barrels
per
day
bpd
and
within
six
months
increasing
to
in
a
scenario
for
tightening
oil
markets

a
boon

she

since

allies
they
would
be
