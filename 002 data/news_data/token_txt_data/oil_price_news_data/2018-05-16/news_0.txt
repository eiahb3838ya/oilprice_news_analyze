iea: high oil prices “taking a toll” on demand
geopolitics
has
taken
over
the
oil
market
driving
oil
prices
up
to
highs
the
inventory
surplus
has
vanished
and
more
outages
could
push
oil
prices
up
even
higher
yet
there
are
some
signs
that
demand
is
starting
to
take
a
hit
as
oil
closes
in
on
per
the
iea
s
may
oil
market
report
the
agency
said
that
opec
might
be
needed
to
step
in
and
fill
the
supply
gap
if
a
significant
portion
of
iran
oil
goes
offline
saudi
arabia
suggested
shortly
after
the
announced
its
withdrawal
from
the
iran
nuclear
deal
that
opec
would
act
to
mitigate
any
supply
shortfall
should
it
while
geopolitical
fears
helped
push
brent
up
to
per
barrel
in
recent
days
the
underlying
fundamentals
are
also
mostly
s
production
is
plummeting
and
output
is
bpd
below
it
agreed
upon
target
as
part
of
the
opec
deal
conservative
estimates
suggest
that
the
country
could
lose
several
hundred
thousand
barrels
per
day
over
the
course
of
but
there
are
several
massive
threats
to
pdvsa
s
operations
that
could
make
that
forecast
look
continues
aggressive
action
to
obtain
control
of
pdvsa
s
assets
after
an
international
arbitration
court
awarded
it
billion
in
awards
related
the
most
underappreciated
story
in
the
oil
marketthere
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion
about
what
conoco
s
actions
mean
for
venezuela
s
oil
production
but
the
asset
seizures
could
be
pivotal
reuters
reports
that
the
american
oil
major
is
now
trying
to
seize
two
cargoes
of
crude
and
fuel
near
a
terminal
in
aruba
run
by
citgo
a
subsidiary
of
pdvsa
the
cargoes
are
holding
barrels
of
oil
and
bpd
of
jet
fuel
gasoline
and
top
of
that
venezuela
is
set
to
hold
a
presidential
election
on
may
an
event
that
could
be
met
with
more
painful
sanctions
conoco
s
actions
combined
with
a
crackdown
by
the
treasury
could
send
venezuela
s
oil
production
deeper
into
a
death
big
question
is
if
supply
will
be
lost
in
iran
which
coupled
with
the
supply
losses
in
venezuela
could
severely
tighten
the
oil
market
the
potential
double
supply
shortfall
represented
by
iran
and
venezuela
could
present
a
major
challenge
for
producers
to
fend
off
sharp
price
rises
and
fill
the
gap
not
just
in
terms
of
the
number
of
barrels
but
also
in
terms
of
oil
quality
the
iea
wrote
in
its
crude
inventories
fell
in
march
by
million
barrels
putting
total
stocks
at
a
low
and
crucially
million
barrels
below
the
average
that
data
point
is
worth
emphasizing
opec
has
claimed
for
more
than
a
year
that
it
was
trying
to
erase
the
inventory
surplus
and
at
least
according
to
iea
data
that
mission
has
now
been
the
group
may
not
be
ready
to
take
their
foot
off
of
the
accelerator
they
meet
in
a
few
weeks
in
vienna
to
figure
out
their
next
steps
but
with
inventories
now
back
at
average
levels
there
is
some
upward
pressure
on
oil
prices
particularly
with
more
outages
looming
in
the
cure
for
higher
oil
prices
tends
to
be
higher
oil
prices
the
iea
lowered
its
demand
forecast
for
by
bpd
not
a
massive
revision
but
notable
because
it
offers
some
signs
that
demand
will
slow
as
prices
rise
some
other
reports
back
up
this
notion
there
are
reportedly
spot
cargoes
for
oil
from
west
africa
russia
and
kazakhstan
that
are
going
unsold
forcing
steep
discounts
while
recent
data
continue
to
point
to
very
strong
demand
in
and
the
start
of
we
expect
a
slowdown
in
growth
in
up
until
now
demand
growth
looked
strong
but
the
recent
jump
in
oil
prices
will
take
its
related
rising
fuel
prices
could
offset
tax
cuts
click
to
enlarge
on
balance
the
report
is
tending
more
to
the
negative
side
demand
for
oil
has
been
revised
downwards
for
the
second
half
of
the
year
from
april
pvm
oil
associates
strategist
tamas
varga
told

noted
that
the
global
economy
is
still
doing
well
and
that
underlying
demand
growth
remains
strong
around
the
that
suggests
demand
won
t
suddenly
fall
off
of
a
cliff
still
the
fact
is
that
crude
oil
prices
have
risen
by
nearly
since
june
the
agency
cautioned
it
would
be
extraordinary
if
such
a
large
jump
did
not
affect
demand
growth
especially
as
subsidies
have
