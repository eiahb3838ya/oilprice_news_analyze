this major cover up could wreak havoc on global oil markets
the
decision
facing
president
donald
trump
is
not
an
easy
one
a
problem
not
of
his
own
choosing
and
one
that
the
politically
charged
president
would
rather
not
have
to
deal
sanction
or
not
sanction
saudi
arabia
over
the
alleged
killing
last
month
of
prominent
saudi
journalist
jamal
khashoggi
that
often
criticized
in
his
washington
post
columns
the
royal
family
and
saudi
prince
mohammed
bin
salman
will
dictate
relations
more
than
any
other
development
since
the
arab
oil
embargo
that
sought
to
punish
washington
and
its
western
allies
over
its
support
of
israel
in
the
fallout
and
disapproval
has
taken
on
a
life
of
its
own
in
both
diplomatic
circles
and
among
global
media
outlets
after
news
initially
broke
that
jamal
khashoggi
had
been
killed
in
the
saudi
consultant
in
istanbul
in
early
october
not
that
politically
charged
killings
are
anything
new
unfortunately
but
the
problem
in
this
instance
was
the
inconsistencies
in
the
saudi
narrative
from
the
narrativesaudi
officials
initially
rejected
assertions
that
khashoggi
had
even
been
killed
on
october
trump
said
saudi
arabia
king
salman
denied
any
involvement
and
the
president
suggested
that
rogue
killers
could
be
responsible
for
the
killing
the
next
day
trump
said
criticism
of
saudi
arabia
was
another
case
of
guilty
until
proven
innocent
and
the
following
day
he
said
he
contacted
turkish
officials
and
requested
audio
and
video
related
to
the
case
if
it
exists
however
amid
all
of
the
uncertainty
and
political
posturing
turkey
pushed
its
investigation
the
associated
press
on
october
quoted
a
turkish
official
as
saying
police
who
entered
the
consulate
found
certain
evidence
that
khashoggi
was
killed
there
the
same
day
the
wall
street
journal
reported
that
turkish
officials
had
shared
with
the
and
saudis
details
of
an
audio
recording
said
to
prove
that
khashoggi
was
beaten
drugged
and
then
killed
minutes
after
entering
the
the
secretary
of
state
mike
pompeo
traveled
to
saudi
arabia
to
discuss
the
case
with
the
saudis
who
according
to
pompeo
pledged
to
conduct
a
thorough
transparent
and
timely
investigation
by
the
and
under
even
more
pressure
both
at
home
and
abroad
trump
said
that
he
believed
that
khashoggi
was
dead
it
certainly
looks
that
way
to
me
he
told
reporters
and
added
that
there
would
be
very
severe
consequences
if
investigations
into
khashoggi
disappearance
conclude
the
saudis
are
responsible

as

saudis

management

orchestrated

managed

four
plus
decades

have
maintained
that

will
remain
separate
in

even
if

if

saudi
line
will
likely
change

see
riyadh
and
their
closest
arab
allies
push
back
and
the
greatest
weapon
they
still
have
is
the
oil
