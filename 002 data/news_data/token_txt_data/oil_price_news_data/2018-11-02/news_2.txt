an epitome of gloom: venezuelaâ€™s oil output is still plunging
you
have
probably
seen
and
read
dozens
of
articles
foretelling
the
impending
fall
of
the
maduro
regime
in
venezuela
a
civil
war
brought
about
by
the
populace
s
pauperization
and
dearth
of
everything
a
traditional
latin
american
coup
d
etat
organized
the
increasingly
powerful
venezuelan
military
etc
the
scenarios
are
manifold
but
we
pretty
much
agree
on
the
outcome
so
far
all
these
predictions
have
sprung
to
life
but
that
is
not
because
they
are
founded
on
incorrect
premises
more
like
the
venezuelan
government
becoming
to
prolong
its
rule
for
another
couple
of
months
or
years
in
the
meantime
as
we
speak
about
iran
sanctions
russia
and
saudi
arabia
wanting
to
institutionalize
and
other
relevant
issues
venezuela
is
sinking
ever
to
kpler
data
loadings
from
venezuela
in
the
first
two
decades
of
october
were
down
to
mbpd
falling
some
kbpd
from
september
alone
even
if
we
are
to
allow
some
space
for
inaccuracies
and
the
difficulty
of
tracking
all
flows
correctly
all
data
sources
point
to
the
same
trend
if
in
the
beginning
of
the
average
weekly
loading
volume
oscillated
between
and
million
barrels
now
it
moves
strictly
within
million
barrels
to
put
it
into
blunter
terms
venezuela
s
production
volume
has
fallen
back
years
to
levels
oil
workers
in
venezuela
have
to
cope
with
problems
completely
unknown
