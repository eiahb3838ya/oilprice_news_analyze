it

reached
seemingly
crippling

a
combination
of

low

and

to

its

a

hubdespite
regularly
occurring
fakes
that
gazprom
is
running

of

the
gas
giant
is
still
keeping
idle
at
of
surplus
production
mostly
on
the
yamal
peninsula
so
technically
it
can
increase
its
supplies
even
further
but
the
real
question
is
whether
there
will
be
sufficient
demand
to
meet
dramatic

until

the
next

still
once
a

now
nord

increasingly
stands
out
as
gazprom
s
future
claim
on

european
consolidation
the
european
commission
antitrust
enquiry
is
effectively
retracted
from
the

agreed
not
to

european
commission
aspirations
to
block
the
project
the
european
council
chief
donald
tusk
keeps
on
urging
member
states
to
adopt
new
eu
gas
rules
which
would
specifically
target
maritime
gas
pipelines
feeding
the
eu
however
germany
and
france
seem
highly
reluctant
to
go
along
with
it
if
the
required
legislation
is
not
passed
unilaterally
before
nord
stream
is
built
and
its
construction
is
already
well
underway
and
expected
to
be
finished
in
germany
could
treat
the
gas
pipeline
as
a
domestic
matter
similarly
to
nord
stream
and
act
without
the
eu
s
from
a
very
few
of
staunch
gazprom
opponents
in
the
european
union
like
poland
or
lithuania
most
countries
might
ease
their
antagonism
gazprom
as
the
gas
conflict
slowly
disentangles
displays
of
solidarity
are
a
must
on
european
level
the
stockholm
arbitration
court
s
recent
ruling
with
both
sides
claiming
victory
stipulates
that
ukraine
maintains
a
contractual
obligation
to
buy
at
least
and
gazprom
ought
to
supply
at
least
a
history
of
belligerent
rhetoric
throughout
when
ukraine
received
no
russian
gas
from
gazprom
only
reversed
russian
gas
resold
from
eu
countries
the
national
company
naftogaz
indicated
willingness
to
start
buying
as
soon
as
this
might
be
a
bit
too
optimistic
considering
the
stockholm
court
is
to
deliver
an
opinion
on
another
issue
the
transit
contract
however
currently
almost
no
one
doubts
this
will
happen
after
the
court
dealings
are
over
the
underlying
motive
is
quite
simple
on
average
ukraine
has
been
paying
a
premium
of
dollars
per
mcm
to
european
traders
for
remarketed
russian
gas
roughly
a
million

every
the
fate
of
gazprom
in

lies
mostly
in
german

the

eastward
progress
has
been
dramatic
often
so
swift
that
it
was
difficult
to
follow
not

is

recently
another
potential
gas
project
has
popped
up
namely
the
pipeline
with
an
estimated
delivery
volume
of
gazprom
and
the
chinese
national
company
cnpc
have
signed
an
initial
agreement
on
the
issue
which
doesn
t
mean
anything
because
the
crucial
issue
as
always
will
boil
down
to
pricing
formulae
but
doubts
remain
whether
gazprom
will
be
able
to
provide
the
required
gas
volumes
the
problem
is
years
ago
the
consortium
the
only
one
so
far
capable
of
providing
the
gas
roughly
equivalent
of
the
chayvo
field
s
peak
output
tried
to
build
a
gas
pipeline
following
a
similar
route
however
gazprom
vetoed
it
on
the
grounds
that
its
exclusive
monopoly
on
gas
exports
disallows
other
producers
to
sell
their
gas
to
sell
additional
volumes
of
gas
to
china
gazprom
would
need
the
consent
of
the
consortium
which
might
not
be
as
enthusiastic
about
the
gas
giant
s
prospects
as
they
would
like
to
think
just
think
of
rosneft
whose
gas
output
is
widely
expected
to
reach

is
desperate
to
break
gazprom
s
export
monopoly
ministry
of
energy
is
pressurizing
the
consortium
to
find
a
consensual
agreement
with
gazprom
steering
clear
of
any
legislative
changes
yet
it
will
be
a
long
and
tough
negotiations
process
but
with
the
gas
export
monopoly
confirmed
by
authorities
to
remain
fully
in
the
hands
of
gazprom
