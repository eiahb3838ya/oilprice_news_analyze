the least compliant country in the opec deal
yesterday
monthly
oil
market
report
from
opec
showed
that
oil
production
from
kazakhstan
likely
increased
by
bpd
in
to
million
barrels
per
day
such
a
rise
gives
kazakhstan
the
unenviable
accolade
of
being
the
most
producer
in
the
opec
nopec
production
cut
deal
surpassing
iraq
some
feat
digging
into
our
export
flows
we
see
a
similar
story
of
committed
to
cutting
production
by
bpd
as
part
of
the
opec
nopec
deal
according
to
our
model
we
should
have
seen
a
fairly
commensurate
drop
in
exports
for
the
country
to
be
in
compliance
but
instead
we
saw
exports
last
year
of
kazakh
cpc
blend
and
batumi
crude
increase
by
drum
roll
just
over
loadings
outpaced
levels
every
month
last
year
except
january
the
current
year
has
started
on
the
front
foot
export
loadings
so
far
in
january
reflect
ongoing
strength

this
export
strength
is
a
direct
result
of
higher
production
which
has
recently
been
pegged
at
about
bpd
above
the
opec
production
deal
cut
target
in
recent
months
this
dovetails
with
opec
view
that
production
increased
bpd
last
year
and
our
view
that
exports
were
up

the
ramp
up
in
kazakhstani
crude
production
and
exports
is
being
driven
by
the
kashagan
field
which
after
over
billion
of
investment
and
sixteen
years
of
development
finally
came
online
in
late
energy
ministry
suggest
that
production
at
the
kashagan
field
will
rise
by
percent

also
indicating
that
kashagan
production
could
rise
above
bpd

the

in
kazakh
production
not
only
is
kashagan
expected
to
grow

the

another

kazakhstan
largest

is
also
seeing

tengiz
could

that
the

started
production
in
basically
the
same
month
as
the
opec

production
cut

was

it
was
always
unlikely
that
kazakhstan
would
be
in
compliance
the
last
year
has
just
proven
this
skepticism
to
be
warranted
