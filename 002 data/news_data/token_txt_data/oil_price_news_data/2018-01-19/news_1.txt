oil traders have never been this bullish
net
long
bets
on
wti
and
brent
hit
over
billion
barrels
last
week
speculators
are
apparently
falling
over
themselves
to
pour
money
into
these
two
futures
and
prices
are
reacting
as
they
usually
do
when
large
amounts
of
money
are
betting
on
these
two
contracts
or
pulling
out
of
them
is
this
good
news
for
producers
though
according
to
some
authors
such
as
bloomberg
gadfly
s
liam
denning
it
s
pretty
good
news
for
shale
drillers
who
are
hedging
their
production
at
higher
prices
and
it
should
be
good
news
for
opec
and
russia
as
well
opec
has
a
habit
of
complaining
about
speculators
clout
on
the
oil
market
but
now
denning
argues
the
cartel
should
be
grateful
to
the
money
managers
for
supporting
should
be
grateful
not
just
because
brent
is
now
hovering
around
us
a
barrel
but
also
because
contracts
are
now
more
expensive
than
ones
and
opec
sells
most
of
its
crude
on
the
spot
as
oilprice
wrote
earlier
this
week
there
are
those
who
don
t
believe
the
current
level
of
oil
prices
is
something
that
opec
is
happy
about
prices
analysts
argue
have
soared
too
high
for
opec
s
comfort
and
now
the
cartel
may
be
looking
for
ways
to
talk
the
price
down
as
citi
s
ed
morse
told
bloomberg
in
other
words
opec
has
no
reason
to
be
grateful
to
speculators
about
their
number
of
long
positions
on
the
contrary
it
has
a
reason
to
be
angry
at
them
related
the
least
compliant
country
in
the
opec
dealbut
some
observers
of
events
on
the
oil
market
note
why
would
opec
or
rather
saudi
arabia
want
to
talk
prices
down
ahead
of
aramco
s
ipo
it
doesn
t
make
sense
to
actively
try
and
push
prices
down
when
riyadh
is
going
all
in
on
a
massive
economic
reform
program
that
will
be
funded
with
the
proceeds
from
the
will
doubtless
continue
to
fly
back
and
forth
until
at
least
june
when
opec
and
russia
will
meet
to
discuss
the
progress
of
the
cut
deal
and
the
next
steps
it
s
unlikely
we
ll
see
either
of
the
above
views
prevail
over
the
other
before
then
but
there
is
something
else
that
could
happen
sooner
rather
than
later
that
would
affect
prices
and
either
help
opec
in
its
perceived
attempts
to
rein
in
the
rally
or
disappoint
it
in
its
quest
for
prices
depending
on
the
something
is
a
selloff
reuters
john
kemp
earlier
this
week
warned
that
bullish
bets
on
the
six
leading
oil
and
oil
product
futures
and
options
had
hit
billion
barrels
in
the
week
to
january
kemp
noted
that
this
is
higher
than
any
other
on
record
exceeding
by
a
wide
margin
anything
seen
even
during
the
spike
in
oil
prices
during
late
and
the
first
half
of
this
level
of
bullish
bets
is
unsustainable
over
any
longer
stretch
of
time
that
much
is
clear
either
or
a
scare
that
prices
are
about
to
start
falling
soon
for
whatever
reason
will
trigger
a
selloff
the
most
likely
reason
for
the
scare
would
be
rising
production
prices
already
reacted
negatively
to
eia
s
latest
weekly
report
that
revealed
oil
production
had
grown
to
million
barrels
a
selloff
